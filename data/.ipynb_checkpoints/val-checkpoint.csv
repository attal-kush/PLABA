50,18496408,"Objective: To compare the accuracy of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein as diagnostic markers of bacterial infection in critically ill children at the onset of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary care, university-affiliated pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Patients: Consecutive patients with SIRS. Interventions: From June to December 2002, all PICU patients were screened daily to include cases of SIRS. At inclusion (onset of SIRS), procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels as well as an array of cultures were obtained. Diagnosis of bacterial infection was made a posteriori by an adjudicating process (consensus of experts unaware of the results of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein). Baseline and daily data on severity of illness, organ dysfunction, and outcome were collected. Measurements and main results: Sixty-four patients were included in the study and were a posteriori divided into the following groups: bacterial SIRS (n = 25) and nonbacterial SIRS (n = 39). Procalcitonin levels were significantly higher in patients with bacterial infection compared with patients without bacterial infection (p = .01). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for procalcitonin was greater than that for C-reactive protein (0.71 vs. 0.65, respectively). A positive procalcitonin level (>or=2.5 ng/mL), when added to bedside clinical judgment, increased the likelihood of bacterial infection from 39% to 92%, while a negative C-reactive protein level (<40 mg/L) decreased the probability of bacterial infection from 39% to 2%. Conclusions: Procalcitonin is better than C-reactive protein for differentiating bacterial from nonbacterial SIRS in critically ill children, although the accuracy of both tests is moderate. Diagnostic accuracy could be enhanced by combining these tests with bedside clinical judgment.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of procalcitonin (involved in calcium balance) and C-reactive protein as measurable, biological indicators, or biomarkers, of bacterial infection. Specifically, this study evaluated the use of these biomarkers in critically ill children at the start of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). This study evaluated patients who were alike in many ways but differed by specific characteristics. This study was based in the tertiary care, university-affiliated pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for child care. The study evaluated patients with SIRS. From June to December 2002, all PICU patients were screened daily to include cases of SIRS. At inclusion (onset of SIRS), procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels, along with several bacterial cultures (bacterial groups grown in a lab), were obtained. Diagnosis of bacterial infection was made following examination of the cultures. Baseline (before study) and daily data on severity of illness, organ dysfunction, and outcome were collected. Sixty-four patients were included in the study. All patients were divided into the one of two groups: bacterial SIRS (25 patients) and nonbacterial SIRS (39 patients). Procalcitonin levels were significantly higher in patients with bacterial infection compared with patients without bacterial infection. Volume of procalcitonin was more predictive of bacterial infection than C-reactive protein. A positive (detected) procalcitonin level increased the likelihood of bacterial infection. A negative (not detected) C-reactive protein level decreased the probability of bacterial infection. Procalcitonin is better than C-reactive protein for differentiating (identifying) bacterial from nonbacterial SIRS in critically ill children. However, the accuracy of both biomarkers is moderate. Diagnostic accuracy could be enhanced by combining these tests with bedside clinical judgment.","The study's objective is to compare the accuracy of procalcitonin (a prototype molecule for a calcium-regulating molecule) and C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation) as markers of bacterial infection in very ill children at the start of full-body or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), an exaggerated immune response to a harmful stressor. The study takes place at a university-partnered child-care unit. Patients include those with SIRS. Treatment was that from June to December 2002, all hospital patients were tested daily to include cases of SIRS. At inclusion (start of SIRS), we measured procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and some cell types. Identification of bacterial infection was made based on facts and judgment of experts unaware of the procalcitonin and C-reactive protein measures. Starting and daily data on illness severity, organ dysfunction, and health outcome were collected. Sixty-four patients were included in the study and divided into either bacterial SIRS group, with 25 patients, or nonbacterial SIRS group, with 39 patients. Procalcitonin levels were higher in patients with bacterial infection than those without. Accuracy was higher for procalcitonin than for C-reactive protein. Detecting high procalcitonin, when added to bedside clinical judgment, increased the chance of bacterial infection from 39% to 92%. Not detecting C-reactive protein decreased the chance of bacterial infection from 39% to 2%. Procalcitonin is better than C-reactive protein for detecting bacterial from nonbacterial SIRS in very ill children, although the accuracy of both tests is moderate. Detection accuracy could be enhanced by combining the tests with bedside clinical judgment."
51,1826249,"It has been suggested that screening all patients with diabetes diagnosed in later life for islet cell antibodies (ICA) would help predict insulin dependence. We have surveyed the case notes of 55 patients (22 male; ages 37-88 years) who were found to be ICA positive over a 9-year screening period to assess what contribution knowledge of ICA status made to their management. Forty-two patients had been put on insulin (half within 6 months of diagnosis and the rest after up to 6 years). Of the 13 patients not on insulin, six were on diet alone and seven on oral hypoglycaemic agents after a median follow-up of 3 years. In 37 of the 42 patients, insulin treatment was started for clinical rather than immunological reasons (diabetic ketoacidosis, ketonuria, weight loss and/or severe symptoms). Five patients were started on insulin because of ICA status when there was no compelling reason on clinical grounds. Knowledge that seven non-insulin-treated patients were ICA positive made doctors reluctant to discharge them from clinic. The data suggest that routine ICA estimation in this age group is unnecessary, as the decision to treat with insulin is best made on clinical grounds, and ICA estimation can lead to unwarranted insulin treatment, or anxiety in patients and doctors who are aware of a positive result.","Checking all people with diabetes detected later in life for islet cell antibodies (ICA; proteins made against insulin-producing cells) may help predict dependence on insulin. We read doctor notes of 55 patients (22 male; ages 37-88 years) who were found to be ICA positive (with ICA) over a 9-year checking period to determine what role ICA status made to their treatment. Forty-two patients had been put on insulin (half within 6 months of diagnosis and half after up to 6 years). Of the 13 patients not on insulin, six were on health diet and seven were on oral (by mouth) medication after about 3 years. In 37 of the 42 patients, insulin treatment was started due to observable symptoms (high levels of blood acids called ketones, high levels of ketones in urine, weight loss, and/or serious symptoms) rather than issues related to the body's defense system. Five patients were started on insulin due to ICA status where no observable symptoms existed. Doctors were hesitant to send home 7 non-insulin-treated, ICA-positive patients. The data suggest that regularly estimating ICA in this age group is not needed, as the decision to treat with insulin should be based on observable symptoms, and ICF estimation can cause unneeded insulin treatment, or anxiety in patients and doctors due to a positive result.",
23,24882081,"Detection of individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessively inherited disorder in phenylalanine degradation, is straightforward and efficient due to newborn screening programs. A recent introduction of the pharmacological treatment option emerged rapid development of molecular testing. However, variants responsible for PKU do not all suppress enzyme activity to the same extent. A spectrum of over 850 variants, gives rise to a continuum of hyperphenylalaninemia from very mild, requiring no intervention, to severe classical PKU, requiring urgent intervention. Locus-specific and genotypes database are today an invaluable resource of information for more efficient classification and management of patients. The high-tech molecular methods allow patients' genotype to be obtained in a few days, especially if each laboratory develops a panel for the most frequent variants in the corresponding population.","Checks for conditions that affect newborns make finding individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), a disorder inherited from both parents in which the body cannot properly turn a substance (phenylalanine) into energy, easy and effective. A recent drug treatment option brought fast development of a lab method that checks for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules that may be a sign of a disease. However, genetic alternations that cause PKU do not equally reduce protein activity. A range of over 850 genetic alterations causes elevated phenylalanine blood levels from very mild with no treatment to severe PKU, which needs immediate treatment. Databases of physical gene locations and alterations carried in a gene allow effective classification and treatment of patients. The lab method that checks for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules determines a patient's genetic alterations in a few days, especially if each lab comes up with a test to look for alterations in more than one gene for the most common alterations in a group of people.",
12,17351472,"Purpose of review: The prevalence of asthma is increasing in many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries. The present review focuses on recent literature regarding asthma prevention in childhood. Recent findings: Several environmental exposures in infancy or early childhood are associated with reduced prevalence of asthma, but the mechanisms leading to these associations remain unknown. Recent studies have demonstrated limited success in the prevention of asthma or asthma symptoms with the use of asthma medications, once the therapy is discontinued. Immunotherapy offers another strategy for asthma prevention, and groups treated with this intervention have demonstrated reduced atopy and asthma. Several multi-interventional trials have demonstrated a reduced asthma symptom burden but have not demonstrated significant differences in objective measures such as lung function or bronchial hyper-responsiveness between intervention groups. Summary: The most promising asthma prevention strategies to date have been those that use a multi-interventional approach employing both dietary and environmental manipulations. More research is needed to assess the long-term follow-up of multi-interventional trials and to evaluate novel intervention strategies in the primary or secondary prevention of asthma in childhood.","Asthma is a long-term condition that affects the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs and makes it hard to breathe. The number of asthma cases is increasing in many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries (countries with a high quality of life, developed economies, and advanced technologies). The present review focuses on recent literature on asthma prevention in childhood. Recent findings show that exposure to some things in the environment as an infant or in early childhood is associated with reduced number of asthma cases, but how these associations are connected is unknown. Recent studies also show limited success in preventing asthma or asthma symptoms when asthma medications are used and then those medicines are stopped. Immunotherapy (treatment that activates or alters the immune system to treat a disease) is another way to prevent asthma. Several studies that use multiple treatment (drugs, therapy, or other steps to improve health) methods showed reduced symptoms of asthma, but these studies did not see any major differences in other measures, such as how well the lungs carried air. In summary, the most promising way to prevent asthma is to use more than one treatment that include changing environmental exposures and diet. More research is needed to understand how the effect of multiple treatments last and to evaluate new treatments to prevent asthma in childhood.","The prevalence of asthma (a disease that restricts breathing) is increasing globally, especially in developed countries. This article focuses on the literature of asthma prevention in childhood. Many early experiences with the environment are linked with reduced widespreadness of asthma, but the reasons are unknown. Recent studies show little success in preventing asthma or its effects with asthma medications, once therapy ends. Immunotherapy, treatment of disease by altering immune system activity, is another treatment for preventing asthma. Groups treated with immunotherapy show fewer allergy developments and asthma. Many multi-treatment trials show reduced intensity of the effects of asthma but not changes in measures like lung function or sensitivity between treatment groups. The most promising prevention treatments of asthma have used multi-treatment strategies with both diet and environmental changes. We need more evidence to measure the effects of multi-treatment trials and new strategies for asthma prevention in childhood."
11,33092611,"Background: The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes the irreversible decarboxylation of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. PDC deficiency can be caused by alterations in any of the genes encoding its several subunits. The resulting phenotype, though very heterogeneous, mainly affects the central nervous system. The aim of this study is to describe and discuss the clinical, biochemical and genotypic information from thirteen PDC deficient patients, thus seeking to establish possible genotype-phenotype correlations. Results: The mutational spectrum showed that seven patients carry mutations in the PDHA1 gene encoding the E1α subunit, five patients carry mutations in the PDHX gene encoding the E3 binding protein, and the remaining patient carries mutations in the DLD gene encoding the E3 subunit. These data corroborate earlier reports describing PDHA1 mutations as the predominant cause of PDC deficiency but also reveal a notable prevalence of PDHX mutations among Portuguese patients, most of them carrying what seems to be a private mutation (p.R284X). The biochemical analyses revealed high lactate and pyruvate plasma levels whereas the lactate/pyruvate ratio was below 16; enzymatic activities, when compared to control values, indicated to be independent from the genotype and ranged from 8.5% to 30%, the latter being considered a cut-off value for primary PDC deficiency. Concerning the clinical features, all patients displayed psychomotor retardation/developmental delay, the severity of which seems to correlate with the type and localization of the mutation carried by the patient. The therapeutic options essentially include the administration of a ketogenic diet and supplementation with thiamine, although arginine aspartate intake revealed to be beneficial in some patients. Moreover, in silico analysis of the missense mutations present in this PDC deficient population allowed to envisage the molecular mechanism underlying these pathogenic variants. Conclusion: The identification of the disease-causing mutations, together with the functional and structural characterization of the mutant protein variants, allow to obtain an insight on the severity of the clinical phenotype and the selection of the most appropriate therapy.","The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is a chemical process in the body that converts molecules and links cells to the final stage of creating energy. PDC deficiency or shortage is a disorder that can be caused by changes in genes. The result of PDC deficiency mainly affects the central nervous system (the spinal cord and brain). This study aims to describe the clinical, biochemical (the chemical processes in living organisms), and genetic information in 13 patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency. All 13 patients carry some type of mutation in the genes that are involved in the PDC process. The mutation in the PDHA1 gene (a gene that helps encode a building block of PDC) is the most common. These data support earlier reports describing PDHA1 mutations as the main cause of PDC deficiency. The data also reveal a notable frequency of the PDHX mutation (another gene that helps encode a building block of PDC) among Portuguese patients who seem to carry a mutation in the community or population. The biochemical analysis showed high levels of lactic acid (high levels occur when oxygen in the body decreases) and high levels of pyruvate plasma (a molecule that helps change sugar in the blood to energy when oxygen levels are low). All patients showed developmental delay (delays or slowness in reaching language, thinking, or motor skills). How serious these delays are seems to match up with the type and location of the mutation carried by the patient. Treatment options include a ketogenic diet (low-carb/high-fat diet) and adding a vitamin called thiamine to the diet, although taking a supplement called arginine aspartate (used for helping to build proteins) may be beneficial in some patients. Moreover, computer modeling of these gene mutations in this PDC deficient population created a picture of underlying causes of these mutations. The identification of the disease-causing mutations provides an insight on the severity of their impact on development and the selection of the best therapy.","The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) quickens the permanent conversion of pyruvate (a particle used for energy-production) into acetyl-CoA (another particle used for energy production). PDC shortage can occur from changes in genes involved in creating its components. The resulting physical traits, though very different, mainly affect the brain and spinal cord. This study explores the medical, biochemical and gene-related information from thirteen PDC scarce patients. The study seeks to create possible gene-physical trait connections. The data agrees with earlier reports describing a specfic gene's sequence changes as the main cause of PDC shortage. However, the results also reveal a large presence of another gene's sequence changes among Portuguese patients. Most carry a possibly private gene sequence change. Regarding medical characteristics, all patients show coordination setback, the intensity of which seems to parallel the type and location of the patient's gene sequence change. Treatment options include administration of a low-carb diet and thiamine, although arginine aspartate may also help. Identifying disease-causing gene sequence changes, along with the altered cellular substances, help explain the physical traits caused by the disease and select the best treatment."
50,15337754,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is a phylogenetically highly conserved plasma protein, with homologs in vertebrates and many invertebrates, that participates in the systemic response to inflammation. Its plasma concentration increases during inflammatory states, a characteristic that has long been employed for clinical purposes. CRP is a pattern recognition molecule, binding to specific molecular configurations that are typically exposed during cell death or found on the surfaces of pathogens. Its rapid increase in synthesis within hours after tissue injury or infection suggests that it contributes to host defense and that it is part of the innate immune response. Recently, an association between minor CRP elevation and future major cardiovascular events has been recognized, leading to the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and the American Heart Association that patients at intermediate risk of coronary heart disease might benefit from measurement of CRP. This review will largely focus on our current understanding of the structure of CRP, its ligands, the effector molecules with which it interacts, and its apparent functions.","C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein that has remained relatively unchanged from evolution.

9,28324139,"Most swallowing problems can be treated, although the treatment depends on the type of dysphagia. A multidisciplinary team of surgeons, phoniatrists, and speech-language therapists is necessary to develop the appropriate treatment strategy. A thorough medical history, clinical investigation of the swallowing muscles, and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with foods of different consistencies help to decide whether swallowing exercises alone are sufficient, or whether an additional pharmacologic or surgical treatment is needed to prevent aspiration, malnutrition, and dehydration.","Most swallowing problems can be fixed, although the treatment depends on the type of trouble swallowing. A team of surgeons, doctors who treat organs involved in speech production, and people who treat communication and swallowing disorders is needed to figure out the best treatment. Information provided by the patient, examination of the swallowing muscles, and using a flexible tube with a camera to see swallowing of different foods help decide whether swallowing exercises are enough, or whether drugs or surgery are also needed to prevent something entering the airway or lungs by accident, prevent a lack of nutrients in the body, and prevent a lack of fluid in the body.","Most swallowing problems can be treated, but the treatment depends on the type of swallowing difficulty. A multi-type team of surgeons, speech-related organ specialists, and speech-language therapists is needed to create appropriate treatment.

6,26926973,"Hyperthyroidism is an excessive concentration of thyroid hormones in tissues caused by increased synthesis of thyroid hormones, excessive release of preformed thyroid hormones, or an endogenous or exogenous extrathyroidal source. The most common causes of an excessive production of thyroid hormones are Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma. The most common cause of an excessive passive release of thyroid hormones is painless (silent) thyroiditis, although its clinical presentation is the same as with other causes. Hyperthyroidism caused by overproduction of thyroid hormones can be treated with antithyroid medications (methimazole and propylthiouracil), radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid gland, or surgical thyroidectomy. Radioactive iodine ablation is the most widely used treatment in the United States. The choice of treatment depends on the underlying diagnosis, the presence of contraindications to a particular treatment modality, the severity of hyperthyroidism, and the patient's preference.","Overactive thyroid is when too much thyroid hormone produced, when too much stored thyroid hormone released, or when there are internal or external thyroid hormone sources outside the thyroid. The most common causes of too much thyroid hormone made are Graves disease, a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells and results in an overactive thyroid, or when one or more glandular growths make extra thyroid hormone. The most common causes of too much thyroid hormone released is thyroid inflammation, although the signs are the same as other causes. Overactive thyroid can be treated with drugs that block the formation of thyroid hormone, radiation therapy, or surgery to remove the thyroid. Radiation therapy is the most widely used treatment in the United States. The choice of treatment depends on the diagnosis, reasons not to use a particular method, how serious the overactive thyroid is, and what the patient wants.",
47,34233724,"Background: Severe hypercalcemia is rare in newborns; even though often asymptomatic, it may have important sequelae. Hypophosphatemia can occur in infants experiencing intrauterine malnutrition, sepsis and early high-energy parenteral nutrition (PN) and can cause severe hypercalcemia through an unknown mechanism. Monitoring and supplementation of phosphate (PO4) and calcium (Ca) in the first week of life in preterm infants are still debated. Case presentation: We report on a female baby born at 29 weeks' gestation with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) experiencing sustained severe hypercalcemia (up to 24 mg/dl corrected Ca) due to hypophosphatemia while on phosphorus-free PN. Hypercalcemia did not improve after hyperhydration and furosemide but responded to infusion of PO4. Eventually, the infant experienced symptomatic hypocalcaemia (ionized Ca 3.4 mg/dl), likely exacerbated by contemporary infusion of albumin. Subsequently, a normalization of both parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was observed. Conclusions: Although severe hypercalcemia is extremely rare in neonates, clinicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of this life-threatening condition in infants with or at risk to develop hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemic hypercalcemia can only be managed with infusion of PO4, with strict monitoring of Ca and PO4 concentrations.","Severe hypercalcemia, or too high calcium blood levels, is rare in newborns. Even though hypercalcemia often shows no symptoms, it may have important effects on overall health. Hypophosphatemia is when the body has low levels of phosphorous. Hypophosphatemia can occur in infants experiencing malnutrition while in the womb, blood infection, and early high-energy parenteral nutrition (PN). PN is when a mother is given nutrients through IV. Hypophosphatemia can cause severe hypercalcemia through an unknown mechanism. It is debated if phosphate (PO4) and calcium (Ca) should be given in the first week of life in preterm infants. This study reports on a female baby born at 29 weeks' gestation (time in womb). The infant had intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and long-term severe hypercalcemia due to hypophosphatemia while on phosphorus-free PN. IUGR is when a baby does not grow to normal weight during pregnancy. Hypercalcemia did not improve after excess water intake but responded to infusion of PO4. Eventually, the infant experienced symptoms of hypocalcemia. This was likely worsened by infusion of albumin, a blood protein. Following this, parathyroid hormone (PTH), which controls calcium and phosphorus in the blood, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which removes phosphate groups, returned to normal levels. Severe hypercalcemia is extremely rare in newborns. However, doctors should be aware of the possible occurrence of this life-threatening condition in infants with or at risk to develop hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemic hypercalcemia can only be managed with infusion of PO4, with strict monitoring of Ca and PO4 concentrations.",
16,23444285,"In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), nocturnal release of proinflammatory cytokines is not adequately counteracted by endogenous glucocorticoid and is associated with symptoms of morning stiffness and pain. Taking exogenous glucocorticoid during the night reduces morning stiffness significantly more than treatment at the conventional time in the morning, although waking to take tablets is unacceptable for patients. Modified-release prednisone tablets were developed to allow administration at bedtime for programmed delivery of glucocorticoid during the night. Single-center crossover studies were conducted, each in ≤24 healthy subjects, to compare the pharmacokinetics of a single 5-mg oral dose of modified-release prednisone and conventional prednisone, as well as the effect of food on bioavailability. There was no substantial difference in pharmacokinetic parameters of the formulations apart from the programmed delay in release of glucocorticoid from the modified-release tablets (C(max) 97%, AUC(0-∞) 101%, 90% confidence intervals within the requisite range for bioequivalence). Administration after a full or light meal did not affect pharmacokinetic characteristics, but bioavailability was reduced under fasted conditions. Pharmacokinetic evaluation in 9 patients with RA confirmed that modified-release prednisone tablets taken at bedtime (around 22:00 h) with or after an evening meal result in programmed release of glucocorticoid 4 to 6 hours after intake.","In rheumatoid arthritis (when the body's immune system attacks its own tissue, including joints, by mistake), nighttime release of proinflammatory cytokines (a type of molecule from immune cells that is capable of creating inflammation) is not prevented well by endogenous glucocorticoid (a type of steroid hormones produced within the body such as in tissues) and is connected with symptoms of morning stiffness and pain. Taking exogenous or external glucocorticoid during the night reduces morning stiffness significantly more than treatment at the usual time in the morning, although waking to take tablets is unacceptable for patients. Modified-release prednisone tablets are developed to allow it to be taken at bedtime for programmed or scheduled delivery of glucocorticoid during the night. Several studies are conducted, each with 24 or less healthy people, to compare pharmacokinetics (how the body handles or responds to a drug) of a single oral dose of modified-release prednisone (a release of part of a drug at a time other than right after the drug is taken) and the regular prednisone. There is no great difference in pharmacokinetic measures of the doses besides the programmed delay in release of glucocorticoid from the modified-release tablets. Taking the drug after a full or light meal did not affect pharmacokinetic characteristics, but how much of the drug that was circulating or floating in the body is reduced under fasted conditions (on an empty stomach or before the first meal of the day). Evaluating the effect of the drug in 9 patients with rheumatoid arthritis confirmed that modified-release (delayed release) prednisone tablets taken at bedtime with or after an evening meal results in programmed release of glucocorticoid 4 to 6 hours after taking the tablets.",
49,23979346,"Aim: Leg edema, observed on comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) of 142 elderly outpatients with a variety of chronic diseases, was studied clinically to clarify its incidence and its associated risk factors. Methods: The severity of pitting edema was assessed at 3 points, namely, the pretibial edge, medial malleolus, and the dorsum of the foot. On palpation, edema was graded as 0 to 3 for each point on one leg, the sum of which was used as the edema score. According to the edema score, subjects were divided into 3 groups; the moderate to severe (MS) group, the slight to mild (SM) group, and the group without pitting edema. The MS group was defined as having an edema score of 4 or more or edema of grade 2 or more, while the SM group was defined as having an edema score of 2 to 3 points without edema of grade 2 or more. The status of underlying disease, vascular risks, varicose veins, medications, daily activity, nutrition, total protein (TP), albumin, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were compared among the 3 groups. Results: There were 36 subjects in the MS group and 19 subjects in the SM group. Diabetes, atrial fibrillation, varicose veins, and polypharmacy were more frequent in the MS group than in the control group. Sedentary life style, house-bound, and gait trouble were significantly more frequent in the MS and SM groups. There were no significant differences in the scores of the Mini-Nutritional Assessment Short Form among the groups, although both the body weight and calf circumference in the MS group were significantly greater than those in the group without pitting edema. Low serum TP, albumin and eGFR were seen in the MS group as well as high BNP levels. Multiple regression analysis revealed diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism, and hypoalbuminemia as risk factors associated with leg edema (R(2)=0.365, p<0.0001). Conclusion: Leg edema was frequent in the elderly outpatients and was associated strongly with diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism, and hypoalbuminemia. These findings suggest that advising against a sedentary life style could help the resolution of edema, and also indicates the clinical usefulness of CGA. Furthermore, leg edema should be seriously considered along with nutritional assessment because edema could influence various anthropometric parameters.","In this study, leg edema (fluid swelling) is studied to understand how frequently it occurs and its associated risk factors. Leg edema is observed on a detailed evaluation of older and frail people called the comprehensive geriatric (elderly) assessment of 142 elderly outpatients with a variety of chronic diseases. The severity of pitting edema, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation, is assessed at 3 places: the shins, the bony bump on the inside of the ankle, and the top part of the foot that faces up when standing. When pressing on the swollen area, edema is graded as 0 to 3 for each point on one leg, the sum of which was used as the edema score. According to the edema score, patients are divided into 3 groups; the moderate to severe group, the slight to mild group, and the group without pitting edema. The moderate to severe group is defined as having an edema score of 4 or more or edema of grade 2 or more, while the slight to mild group is defined as having an edema score of 2 to 3 points without edema of grade 2 or more. The following tests and measurements are compared among the 3 groups: the status of underlying disease, risks to developing heart problems, varicose (twisted, enlarged) veins, medications, daily activity, nutrition, tests for proteins in the body, and tests for how well the kidneys are working. There are 36 patients in the moderate to severe group and 19 subjects in the slight to mild group. Diabetes, an irregular heart beat (atrial fibrillation), varicose veins, and being on multiple drugs at one time are more frequent in the moderate to severe group than in the comparison group. Sedentary life style (no or little physical activity), house-bound, and walking trouble are much more frequent in the moderate to severe and slight to mild groups. There are no significant differences in the scores on malnourishment (poor nutrition) among the groups, although both the body weight and calf circumference (size) in the moderate to severe group are much greater than those in the group without pitting edema. Low levels of total protein in the blood, another protein made by liver called albumin, and kidney function tests are seen in the moderate to severe group as well as high levels of a protein made by heart and blood vessels called BNP. Data analysis revealed diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism (inactivity), and low levels of the protein albumin as risk factors associated with leg edema. In conclusion, leg edema is frequent in the elderly outpatients and is associated strongly with diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism, and low levels of albumin in the blood. These findings suggest that advising against an inactive life style could help resolve edema, and also indicates the usefulness of comprehensive geriatric assessment to evaluate older populations. Furthermore, leg edema should be seriously considered along with evaluating the diet of patients because edema could influence various physical measurements of the body.",
33,7665723,"Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant drug, which in man is cleared solely by renal excretion and is not bound to plasma proteins. Because the clearance of gabapentin is dependent on renal function, the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin were investigated in anuric subjects maintained on hemodialysis. Plasma samples were obtained over an 8-day period after administration of single oral 400-mg doses of gabapentin. Pre- and post-dialyzer plasma samples and dialysate samples from quantitative collection of dialyzer effluent were obtained during hemodialysis sessions performed 2, 4, and 7 days after dosing. A mean (SD) maximum gabapentin plasma concentration of 6.0 (2.4) micrograms/mL was achieved at 4.7 (2.1) hours post-dose. The elimination half-life of gabapentin on non-hemodialysis days averaged 132 hours. Approximately 35% of the gabapentin dose was recovered in dialysate, and mean hemodialysis clearance of gabapentin was 142 (26) mL/min; approximately 93% of the dialyzer creatinine clearance. Gabapentin elimination half-life during hemodialysis was approximately 4 hours. Systemic plasma gabapentin concentrations increased approximately 30% during the first 2 hours after hemodialysis as a result of drug redistribution in the body. It is recommended that patients with end-stage renal disease maintained on hemodialysis receive an initial 300-mg to 400-mg gabapentin loading dose. Plasma gabapentin concentrations can be maintained by giving 200 to 300 mg of gabapentin after every 4 hours of hemodialysis.","Gabapentin is a nerve-related pain drug, which in humans is cleared from the body solely by the kidneys and is not attached to proteins in plasma (the liquid part of blood). Because the clearance of gabapentin depends on the kidneys, how the body processes gabapentin is investigated in patients who do not make enough urine and who are on dialysis, a process of cleaning the blood of a person whose kidneys are not working normally. Plasma samples are collected over an 8-day period after a single oral (by mouth) dose of gabapentin is given. Plasma samples before and after being filtered, as well as dialysis fluid, are collected during dialysis sessions performed 2, 4, and 7 days after receiving the gabapentin dose. An average maximum amount of gabapentin in plasma is achieved at 4.7 hours after the dose. The time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma to be reduced by half on non-dialysis days averages 132 hours. About 35% of gabapentin dose is recovered in dialysis fluid, and the average clearance of gabapentin in dialysis was 142 milliliters per minute. The time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma to be reduced by half during dialysis is about 4 hours. Gabapentin concentrations in the plasma increased about 30% during the first 2 hours after dialysis as a result of the drug being sent to other parts of the body. It is recommended that patients with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis receive a starting 300-mg to 400-mg gabapentin dose. Plasma gabapentin concentrations can remain stable by giving 200 to 300 mg of gabapentin after every 4 hours of dialysis.","Gabapentin is an antiseizure drug, which in man is cleared just by kidney removal and is not bound to blood proteins. Because gabapentin clearance is dependent on kidney function, the drug activity of gabapentin was investigated in patients unable to make urine and maintained on artifical kidney machines or hemodialysis. We took blood samples over an 8-day period after treatment of single 400-mg swallowed doses of gabapentin. Blood and kidney solution samples were obtained during treatment sessions performed 2, 4, and 7 days after dosing. An average maximum gabapentin blood level of 6.0 micrograms/mL was measured at 4.7 hours after the dose. The time for half of gabapentin to clear on non-hemodialysis days was 132 hours. Around 35% of the gabapentin dose was recovered in the fluid of the artificial kidney machine. The average hemodialysis clearance of gabapentin was 142 mL/min; around 93% of the standard dialyzer clearance. The time for half of gabapentin to clear during hemodialysis was around 4 hours. Blood gabapentin levels increased around 30% during the first 2 hours after hemodialysis due to drug redistribution in the body. It is recommended that patients with kidney failure and on hemodialysis get an initial 300-mg to 400-mg gabapentin starting dose. Blood gabapentin levels can be maintained by giving 200 to 300 mg of gabapentin after every 4 hours of hemodialysis."
55,24473982,"Loss of function in mitochondria, the key organelle responsible for cellular energy production, can result in the excess fatigue and other symptoms that are common complaints in almost every chronic disease. At the molecular level, a reduction in mitochondrial function occurs as a result of the following changes: (1) a loss of maintenance of the electrical and chemical transmembrane potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane, (2) alterations in the function of the electron transport chain, or (3) a reduction in the transport of critical metabolites into mitochondria. In turn, these changes result in a reduced efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation and a reduction in production of adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP). Several components of this system require routine replacement, and this need can be facilitated with natural supplements. Clinical trials have shown the utility of using oral replacement supplements, such as L-carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid (α-lipoic acid [1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid]), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10 [ubiquinone]), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), membrane phospholipids, and other supplements. Combinations of these supplements can reduce significantly the fatigue and other symptoms associated with chronic disease and can naturally restore mitochondrial function, even in long-term patients with intractable fatigue.","Loss of function in mitochondria, the key organelle responsible for cellular energy production, can result in the excess fatigue and other symptoms commonly found in chronic diseases.

We tested therapeutic equine polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) that are being assessed in clinical trials in Costa Rica against five globally circulating variants of concern: alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma and delta, using plaque reduction neutralization assays. We show that equine pAbs efficiently neutralize the variants of concern, with inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.146-1.078 μg/mL, which correspond to extremely low concentrations when compared to pAbs doses used in clinical trials. Equine pAbs are an effective, broad coverage, low-cost and a scalable COVID-19 treatment.","Coronavirus variants of concern (variants that are easier to transmit and/or are more severe) show reduced effect from monoclonal antibodies which are drugs that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 (a viral breathing-related disorder) from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce.

28,34571039,"The global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its threat to humans have drawn worldwide attention. The acute and long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the nervous system pose major public health challenges. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 present diverse symptoms of the central nervous system. Exploring the mechanism of coronavirus damage to the nervous system is essential for reducing the long-term neurological complications of COVID-19. Despite rapid progress in characterizing SARS-CoV-2, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the brain remain unclear. The possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 injury to the central nervous system include: 1) direct injury of nerve cells, 2) activation of the immune system and inflammatory cytokines caused by systemic infection, 3) a high affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein for the angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE2, 4) cerebrovascular disease caused by hypoxia and coagulation dysfunction, and 5) a systemic inflammatory response that promotes cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases. Although we do not fully understand the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes nerve injury, we hope to provide a framework by reviewing the clinical manifestations, complications, and possible mechanisms of neurological damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. With hope, this will facilitate the early identification, diagnosis, and treatment of possible neurological sequelae, which could contribute toward improving patient prognosis and preventing transmission.","The ongoing global pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease). It has threatened public health and drawn worldwide attention. The short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 on the nervous system pose major public health challenges. Patients with COVID-19 present a wide range of symptoms of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). It is essential to better understand how COVID-19 affects the nervous system. Increasing current understanding will reduce the long-term effects COVID-19 may cause within the brain. Despite rapid progress in better understanding how COVID-19 hurts the human body, the long-term effects of the virus on the brain are still unclear. There are several possible ways COVID-19 affects the central nervous system. One of these ways is by potentially hurting nerve cells. Second, the virus may cause body-wide inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) that may activate the immune system. Third, COVID-19 may be highly attracted to a specific pathway into cells and can then rapidly distribute throughout the body. Fourth, the virus may cause disease by decreasing oxygen and increase blood clotting within the body. And lastly, COVID-19 may cause body-wide inflammation that decreases brain function. Despite not fully understanding how COVID-19 causes nerve injury, the authors hoped to provide a review of clinical reports, documented human health effects, and potential pathways of COVID-19-caused brain damage. The aim of this paper was to assist in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19-caused brain damage. Additionally, the authors hope this can help predict COVID-19 related effects before they occur and decrease viral spread in general.","The global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a breathing-related viral illness, and its threat to humans have drawn worldwide attention.

10,30328699,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by pain, functional disability, poor quality of life (QoL), high socioeconomic impact, and annual costs of over $56 billion in the United States. Acupuncture (AC) is widely in use; however, studies show severe methodological shortcomings, did not consider the functional diagnosis for the allocation of acupoints and their results showed no differences between verum and control groups. Objective: The authors aimed to objectively assess the safety and efficacy of AC treatments for RA. Methods: 105 RA patients with a functional diagnosis of a ""Pivot syndrome"" or ""Turning Point syndrome"" were randomly assigned to (1) verum-AC (verum acupoints), (2) control-AC (sham acupoints-points outside of the conduits/meridians and of the extra-conduits), or (3) waiting list (each group n = 35). AC groups experienced the exact same number, depth, and stimulation of needles. Assessments took place before and 5 min after AC with follow-ups over 4 weeks. Results: (1) Verum-AC significantly improved self-reported pain (Z = -5.099, p < 0.001) and pressure algometry (Z = -5.086, p < 0.001); hand grip strength (Z = -5.086, p < 0.001) and arm strength (Z = -5.086, p < 0.001); health status improved significantly (p < 0.001, Z = -4.895); QoL improved significantly in 7/8 survey domains; and number of swollen joints (Z = -2.862, p = 0.004) and tender joints (Z = -3.986, p < 0.001) significantly decreased. (2) Control-AC showed no significant changes, except in self-reported pain improvement. (3) Waiting list group showed an overall worsening. Conclusion: This is the first double-blind controlled study on AC in RA of the hand that objectively and specifically assesses positive effects supporting its integration in rheumatology. Acupoint allocation according to Chinese Medicine functional diagnoses is extremely relevant to assess AC effectiveness in a patient group primarily defined by a ""western"" medicine diagnosis. Based on clear allocation criteria for acupoints, the authors minimized the possible bias of unspecific and suggestive effects on the control group, showed the specific effects of the points chosen, improved efficacy, and identified an evidence base for AC.","Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the body by mistake. It can cause pain, decrease movement, lead to poor quality of life, impact the social and economic parts of communities, and cost over $56 billion in the United States every year. Acupuncture involves pricking the skin or tissues with thin needles at key points in the body to reduce pain and is widely used. However, studies show problems in the methods used to measure acupuncture. The aim of this current study is to evaluate the safety and the performance of acupuncture treatments on rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, 105 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and a specific diagnosis were randomly assigned to either the acupuncture group, the sham acupuncture group (where the patient is pricked with thin needles but at different, less key points of the body), or a waiting list group. Each group had 35 patients. The acupuncture groups (both normal and sham) experienced the exact same number, depth, and stimulation of needles. A physical and visual exam of patients took place before and 5 minutes after acupuncture treatment with follow-up visits over 4 weeks. Patients in the acupuncture group showed signficantly improved pain and pain sensitivity, hand grip and arm strength, as well as improved health status. Quality of life significantly improved in 7 out of 8 parts of a survey. The number of swollen joints and tender joints signficantly decreased. In the sham acupuncture group (the group that received needle pricks but outside the key points of the body) did not have any significant changes in their condition except in pain improvement. The waiting list group showed an overall worsening. This is the first double-blind controlled study (where neither the patients nor the researcher knows which treatment participants are getting) on acupuncture for rheumatoid arthritis of the hand. The study shows positive effects supporting acupuncture's inclusion in other treatments for rheumatology (diseases in the joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments). The site of the acupuncture needle is very important to determine acupuncture effectiveness. Because the authors in this study clearly defined the placement of the acupuncture needles on the body, they reduced possible bias, showed how the placement of the needles affects the body, improved performance of acupuncture, and identified evidence to support use of acupuncture.",

Additional factors associated with pressure ulcer development include cerebrovascular accident, impaired nutritional intake, urinary or fecal incontinence, hypoalbuminemia, and previous fracture. Implementation of preventive measures, such as an in-depth assessment for mobility, a pressure-relieving device combined with adequate repositioning, and thorough evaluation for nutritional status and urinary incontinence, significantly reduce pressure ulcer incidence. If the pressure ulcer is a partial thickness (stage II) wound, the causative factors are probably friction or moisture. If the ulcer is full thickness (stage III and IV), it is secondary to pressure or shearing forces. The development of wound infection is the most common complication in the management approach. Osteomyelitis is not an uncommon occurrence and must be initially ruled out in all full thickness pressure ulcers. Surgical debridement of necrotic tissue is necessary prior to further treatment and assessments. Antibiotic therapy is indicated only upon evidence of infection (cellulitis, osteomyelitis, leukocytosis, bandemia, or fever).

Two sera with a ""beta-cell restricted"" staining, five with an ""all-islet cell"" staining and three with a ""mixed"" pattern were employed. In all three groups, the highest end-point titres were obtained when pancreata of rats treated with glipizide were used. Intermediate titres were seen in control animals and the lowest titres were observed on pancreata from diazoxide-treated rats, regardless of the serum used. In contrast to these observations, no correlation between ICSA reactivity and islet cell activity could be demonstrated.

34,26391748,"A panel of internists and nephrologists developed this practical approach for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative to guide assessment and care of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by primary care clinicians. Chronic kidney disease is defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min/1.73m  and/or markers of kidney damage for at least 3 months. In clinical practice the most common tests for CKD include GFR estimated from the serum creatinine concentration (eGFR) and albuminuria from the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Assessment of eGFR and albuminuria should be performed for persons with diabetes and/or hypertension but is not recommended for the general population. Management of CKD includes reducing the patient's risk of CKD progression and risk of associated complications, such as acute kidney injury and cardiovascular disease, anemia, and metabolic acidosis, as well as mineral and bone disorder. Prevention of CKD progression requires blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for patients with albuminuria and hypertension, hemoglobin A1c ≤7% for patients with diabetes, and correction of CKD-associated metabolic acidosis. To reduce patient safety hazards from medications, the level of eGFR should be considered when prescribing, and nephrotoxins should be avoided, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The main reasons to refer to nephrology specialists are eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), severe albuminuria, and acute kidney injury. The ultimate goal of CKD management is to prevent disease progression, minimize complications, and promote quality of life.","A group of internal medicine and kidney doctors developed a practical approach to guide the assessment (diagnosis) and care of chronic kidney disease by primary care doctors. Chronic kidney disease is defined by using a glomerular filtration rate, a blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working, and/or other measurements or conditions that are a sign of kidney damage for at least 3 months. The most common tests for chronic kidney disease include the glomerular filtration rate that is estimated from the amount of creatinine (a waste product from the normal wear and tear on muscles) in the blood and too much albumin (a blood protein) in the urine which is called albuminuria. These tests for creatinine levels and albumin proteins should be done for people with diabetes and/or high blood pressure but are not recommended for the general population. Managing chronic kidney disease includes reducing the patient's risk of the disease getting worse and risk of related complications, such as acute or immediate kidney injury or heart disease. To prevent chronic kidney disease from worsening, managing blood pressure, using medications to treat high albumin levels and high blood pressure, measuring hemoglobin levels (red blood cells) for patients with diabetes, and correcting when there is too much acid in the body's fluids is needed. To reduce the negative effect of medications on patients, the level of creatinine should be noted when prescribing drugs, and nephrotoxins which can damage the kidneys should be avoided. The main reasons to send a patient to a kidney specialist are based on creatinine levels, severe albuminuria (too much protein in urine), and acute kidney injury (a sudden episode of kidney failure). The main goal of managing chronic kidney disease is to prevent the disease from getting worse, to minimize complications, and to promote quality of life.","A group of specialists created this practical approach for Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative to guide analysis and care of long-lasting or chronic kidney disease (CKD) by primary care workers.

31,30791698,"Background: Tardive dyskinesia is a movement disorder characterised by irregular, stereotyped, and choreiform movements associated with the use of antipsychotic medication. We aim to provide recommendations on the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. Results: Preventing tardive dyskinesia is of primary importance, and clinicians should follow best practice for prescribing antipsychotic medication, including limiting the prescription for specific indications, using the minimum effective dose, and minimising the duration of therapy. The first-line management of tardive dyskinesia is the withdrawal of antipsychotic medication if clinically feasible. Yet, for many patients with serious mental illness, the discontinuation of antipsychotics is not possible due to disease relapse. Switching from a first-generation to a second-generation antipsychotic with a lower D2 affinity, such as clozapine or quetiapine, may be effective in reducing tardive dyskinesia symptoms. The strongest evidence for a suitable co-intervention to treat tardive dyskinesia comes from tests with the new VMAT inhibitors, deutetrabenazine and valbenazine. These medications have not been approved for use in Canada. Conclusion: Data on tardive dyskinesia treatment are limited, and the best management strategy remains prevention. More long-term safety and efficacy data are needed for deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, and their routine availability to patients outside of the USA remains in question.","Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by possibly irreversible, abnormal, uncontrolled movements related to the use of antipsychotics. We try to suggest ways to treat tardive dyskinesia. Preventing tardive dyskinesia is very important, and doctors should prescribe antipsychotics as recommended, including only prescribing them for certain conditions, using the lowest working dose, and limiting how long patients take them. The first recommended treatment of tardive dyskinesia is to have the patient stop taking antipsychotics if possible. Stopping antipsychotics is not possible for many patients with serious mental illness due to the disease returning. Switching from a first-generation (older) to a second-generation (newer) antipsychotic, such as clozapine or quetiapine, may help reduce tardive dyskinesia symptoms. Studies show tests with new vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, to be the best additional treatment for tardive dyskinesia. Canada has not approved these drugs for use. We conclude that information on tardive dyskinesia treatment is limited, and preventing TD is the best way to manage it. More studies that look at safety and how well deutetrabenazine and valbenazine work are needed, and it is uncertain how reliably available these drugs are to patients outside of the United States.","Tardive duskinesia is a movement disorder of irregular, repetitive, and jerking movements linked with using antipsychotic medication for treating mental illnesses. We aim to provide recommendation on treating tardive dyskinesia. Preventing tardive dyskinesia is very important. Clinicians should follow the best policies for prescribing antipsychotic medication. These include limiting the amount for specific symptoms, using the minimum effective dose, and minimising the duration of treatment. The first-to-try treatment of tardive dyskinesia is removing antipsychotic medication if clinically possible. Yet, for many patients with serious mental illness, removing antipsychotics is not possible due to disease reappearance. Switching from one class to another class of antipsychotics, like clozapine or quetiapine, may help reduce tardive dyskinesia symptoms. The strongest evidence for a suitable co-treatment for tardive dyskinesia comes from tests with new VMAT inhibitors, deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, which treat movement disorders. These drugs have not been approved for use in Canada. Data on tardive dyskinesia treatment is limited. The best treatment remains prevention. We need more long-term safety and effectiveness data for deutetrabenazine and valbenazine. Their regular availability to patients outside the USA is unknown."
11,18206410,"We determined the ability of self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) vectors to deliver and express the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha subunit gene (PDHA1) in primary cultures of skin fibroblasts from 3 patients with defined mutations in PHDA1 and 3 healthy subjects. Cells were transduced with scAAV vectors containing the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene at a vector:cell ratio of 200. Transgene expression was measured 72h later. The transduction efficiency of scAAV2 and scAAV6 vectors was 3- to 5-fold higher than that of the other serotypes, which were subsequently used to transduce fibroblasts with wild-type PDHA1 cDNA under the control of the chicken beta-action (CBA) promoter at a vector:cell ratio of 1000. Total PDH-specific activity and E1alpha protein expression were determined 10 days post-transduction. Both vectors increased E1alpha expression 40-60% in both control and patient cells, and increased PDH activity in two patient cell lines. We also used dichloroacetate (DCA) to maximally activate PDH through dephosphorylation of E1alpha. Exposure for 24h to 5mM DCA increased PDH activity in non-transduced control (mean 37% increase) and PDH deficient (mean 44% increase) cells. Exposure of transduced patient fibroblasts to DCA increased PDH activity up to 90% of the activity measured in untreated control cells. DCA also increased expression of E1alpha protein and, to variable extents, that of other components of the PDH complex in both non-transduced and transduced cells. These data suggest that a combined gene delivery and pharmacological approach may hold promise for the treatment of PDH deficiency.","This study focuses on the ability of self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) vectors (a gene therapy tool that introduces genetic material using a modified virus to create a normal copy of a damaged gene) to deliver the pyruvate dehydrogenase gene called PDHA1 (a gene involved in the chemical process to create energy for the body) and create proteins. Cell samples of connective tissue from 3 patients with mutations in PDHA1 and 3 healthy patients were collected for the gene therapy process. Cells are given genetic material with scAAV vectors containing a gene that creates proteins. Two types of vectors, the scAAV2 and scAAv6, were found to be the most effective way to deliver the genetic material into cells. Both vectors increase the production of gene proteins in patients with the damaged genes and in patients with healthy cells. Dichloroacetate, a drug used to treat genetic mitochondrial diseases (diseases where the miochondria cannot create enough energy for cells), is also used to activate pyruvate dehydrogenase, (an enzyme used in metabolism to create energy). The use of dichloroacetate did increase productivity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in cells with damaged genes involved in metabolism. Dichloroacetate did increase production of proteins from certain energy-related genes and activity in other parts of pyruvate dehydrogenase (a protein involved in the chemical process that creates energy for the body). This study shows that a combination of gene therapy and drugs may be a promising treatment for people with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency or shortage.",
22,32943413,"Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare inherited autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene FLCN, encoding the protein folliculin. Its clinical expression typically includes multiple pulmonary cysts, recurrent spontaneous pneumothoraces, cutaneous fibrofolliculomas and renal tumours of various histological types. BHD has no sex predilection and tends to manifest in the third or fourth decade of life. Multiple bilateral pulmonary cysts are found on chest computed tomography in >80% of patients and more than half experience one or more episodes of pneumothorax. A family history of pneumothorax is an important clue, which suggests the diagnosis of BHD. Unlike other cystic lung diseases such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, BHD does not lead to progressive loss of lung function and chronic respiratory insufficiency. Renal tumours affect about 30% of patients during their lifetime, and can be multiple and recurrent. The diagnosis of BHD is based on a combination of genetic, clinical and/or skin histopathological criteria. Management mainly consists of early pleurodesis in the case of pneumothorax, periodic renal imaging for tumour detection, and diagnostic work-up in search of BHD in relatives of the index patient.","Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare inherited genetic disorder caused by changes in the gene FLCN that makes a protein called folliculin, which helps suppress tumor growth. It is often associated with the development of multiple cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs, sudden collapse of the lung, non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck, and chest (fibrofolliculomas), and kidney tumors. Birt-Hogg-Dubé has no preference between male and female and often appears when people are in their 30s or 40s. Multiple cysts on both lungs are identified using x-rays in more than 80% of patients. More than half experience one or more collapsed lung events which is when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall. A family history of collapsed lung is an important clue and suggests a diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé. Unlike other cystic lung diseases, Birt-Hogg-Dubé does not lead to loss of lung function over time or to ongoing breathing problems. Kidney tumors affect about 30% of patients during their lifetime. There can be multiple number of tumors, and they can be recurring. The diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé is based on a combination of genetic and medical characteristics and/or studying skin and skin cells with a microscope. For a collapsed lung, care mostly involves doing a procedure called pleurodesis early that involves sticking the lung to the chest wall to reduce space in the lungs and chest wall. Scanning the kidneys for tumors using x-rays and finding out if relatives have Birt-Hogg-Dubé are also ways to manage the disorder.","Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare inherited disorder caused by heritable DNA mutations in the tumor stopping gene FLCN, used to create the protein folliculin.

However, the impacts of such deficiencies on the etiology of the disease have been the object of intense debates. The aim of the present review is first to highlight the general consensus on fatty acid dysregulations that emerges from, sometimes apparently contradictory, studies. In a second step, a unifying mechanism for the potential impacts of these fatty acid dysregulations in CF cells, based on alterations of membrane biophysical properties (known as lipointoxication), is proposed.

The throat swabs, sputum, and stool samples from 57 hospitalized coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers, among 170 returning healthy travelers were tested using reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction. SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies were detected via serum chemiluminescence assay. Sequential results showed higher viral RNA loads in the throat, sputum, and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptom onset among severely ill COVID-19 patients. Shorter viral habitation time (1-8 days) was observed in the oropharyngeal site and intestinal tract of asymptomatic carriers. The IgG and IgM response rates were 19/37 (51.4%) and 23/37 (62.6%) among the 29 confirmed patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers, respectively, within 66 days from symptom or detection onset. The median duration between symptom onset and positive IgG and IgM results was 30 (n=23; interquartile range [IQR]=20-66) and 23 (n=19; IQR=12-28) days, respectively. Of 170 returning healthy-travelers to China, 4.7% were asymptomatic carriers (8/170) within 2 weeks, and the IgG and IgM positivity rate was 12.8% (12/94). IgM/IgG-positivity confirmed 3 suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, despite negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

MPS function was assessed before steroid treatment, and again 24 hours after the last dose of prednisone. Elimination kinetics and the uptake of the immunoglobulin aggregates by liver and spleen did not change after prednisone treatment. This suggests that, in contrast to general belief, high doses of glucocorticosteroids have no direct, acute effect on MPS function.","It is though that glucocorticosteroids (strong medicines that fight inflammation and work with the immune system) disrupt the elimination of immune complexes (build-up in the blood that can cause infection and problems with the immune system) by the mononuclear phagocyte system (a family of cells that fight foreign substances and are part of the immune system).

Knockout mouse models suggest that OSR1 mainly activates NKCC2, while SPAK mainly activates NCC, with possible cross-compensation. We tested the hypothesis that disrupting both kinases causes severe polyuria and salt-wasting by generating SPAK/OSR1 double knockout (DKO) mice. DKO mice displayed lower systolic blood pressure compared with SPAK knockout (SPAK-KO) mice, but displayed no severe phenotype even after dietary salt restriction. Phosphorylation of NKCC2 at SPAK/OSR1-dependent sites was lower than in SPAK-KO mice, but still significantly greater than in wild type mice. In the renal medulla, there was significant phosphorylation of NKCC2 at SPAK/OSR1-dependent sites despite a complete absence of SPAK and OSR1, suggesting the existence of an alternative activating kinase. The distal convoluted tubule has been proposed to sense plasma [K(+) ], with NCC activation serving as the primary effector pathway that modulates K(+) secretion, by metering sodium delivery to the collecting duct. Abundance of phosphorylated NCC (pNCC) is dramatically lower in SPAK-KO mice than in wild type mice, and the additional disruption of OSR1 further reduced pNCC. SPAK-KO and kidney-specific OSR1 single knockout mice maintained plasma [K(+) ] following dietary potassium restriction, but DKO mice developed severe hypokalaemia. Unlike mice lacking SPAK or OSR1 alone, DKO mice displayed an inability to phosphorylate NCC under these conditions. These data suggest that SPAK and OSR1 are essential components of the effector pathway that maintains plasma [K(+) ].","Two protein enzymes called STE20 (Sterile 20)/SPS-1 related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress-response kinase-1 (OSR1) activate the kidney-related cotransporters (carrier proteins that carry two different ions or other species from one side of the cell to the other) Na(+) -K(+) -2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC2) and Na(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter (NCC). Knockout mouse models (experiments with mice that lack a specific gene) suggest that OSR1 mainly activates NKCC2, while SPAK mainly activates NCC, and sometimes compensate for one another. Researchers tested the idea that disrupting both enzymes causes severe polyuria (passing unusually large amounts of urine) and salt-wasting by producing SPAK/OSR1 double knockout (DKO) mice - mice without SPAK or OSR1. DKO mice showed lower systolic blood pressure (the top number of blood pressure that indicates how much pressure the blood is exerting against artery walls when the heart beats) compared to SPAK knockout (SPAK-KO) mice, but showed no severe phenotype (observable traits or characteristics) even after salt restriction in food. Phosphorylation (a process of adding a phosphate group, a group of atoms that have different roles and make up DNA and RNA, to a molecule to prepare it to change or do work) of NKCC2 at SPAK/OSR1-dependent sites was lower than in SPAK-KO mice (mice without SPAK), but still much greater than in wild-type or normal mice. In the innermost part of the kidney called the medulla, there was significant phosphorylation of NKCC2 at SPAK/OSR1-dependent sites despite a complete absence of SPAK and OSR1, which suggests the existence of another activating kinase enzyme. The distal convoluted tubule (a part within the kidney that connects to the collecting duct system that refines salt and water reabsorption) has been suggested to sense blood potassium by monitoring sodium delivery to the collecting duct. A lot of phosphorylated Na(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter (pNCC) is dramatically lowered in SPAK-KO mice than in wild type mice, and the additional disruption of OSR1 further reduced pNCC. SPAK-KO and kidney-specific OSR1 single knockout mice (mice without OSR1 only in the kidney) maintained potassium in the blood following restrictions of potassium in food, but DKO mice developed severe hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood). Unlike mice lacking SPAK or OSR1 alone, SPAK/OSR1 double knockout (DKO) mice showed an inability to phosphorylate NCC under these conditions. These data suggest that STE20 (Sterile 20)/SPS-1 related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress-response kinase-1 (OSR1) are essential components of the pathway that maintains potassium in the blood.",

In young patients, renal neoplasms that are multiple, bilateral, or both, such as oncocytomas, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hybrid chromophobe RCC-oncocytomas, clear cell RCC, and papillary RCC, can suggest BHD syndrome. Extrarenal findings, including dermal lesions, pulmonary cysts, and spontaneous pneumothoraces, also aid in diagnosis. Conclusion: Radiologists may be one of the first medical specialists to suggest the diagnosis of BHD syndrome. Knowledge of pathogenesis and management, including the importance of the types of renal neoplasms in a given patient, is needed to properly recognize this rare condition.","Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a genetically inherited syndrome involving multiple organs.

51,1541379,"Basal insulin secretion was compared in nine islet-cell antibody positive, non-diabetic first-degree relatives of children with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and nine normal control subjects matched for age, sex and weight. Acute insulin responses to a 25 g intravenous glucose tolerance test were similar in the two groups (243 (198-229) vs 329 (285-380) mU.l-1 x 10 min-1, mean (+/- SE), p = 0.25). Fasting plasma insulin was assayed in venous samples taken at one min intervals for 2 h. Time series analysis was used to demonstrate oscillatory patterns in plasma insulin. Autocorrelation showed that regular oscillatory activity was generally absent in the islet-cell antibody-positive group, whereas a regular 13 min cycle was shown in control subjects (p less than 0.0001). Fourier transformation did, however, show a 13 min spectral peak in the islet-cell antibody positive group, consistent with intermittent pulsatility. We conclude that overall oscillatory patterns of basal insulin secretion are altered in islet-cell antibody positive subjects even when the acute insulin response is within the normal range.","We compared background insulin release in nine islet-cell antibody (protein made against insulin-producing cells) positive, non-diabetic parents or siblings of children with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes and nine normal people matched for age, sex and weight. Short-term insulin responses to an I.V. (injected) glucose tolerance test were similar in the two groups. We measured blood insulin in people who had not had anything to eat for a period of time in blood samples taken every minute for 2 hours. We looked at blood insulin over time to see how it rises and falls. The islet-cell antibody-positive group (group with the antibody) did not have a regular pattern, but normal people had a 13-minute cycle. The islet-cell antibody-positive group did have a peak every 13 minutes. We conclude that the overall rise and fall of background insulin release is changed in islet-cell antibody positive people even when the short-term insulin response is normal.",
23,7766949,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a large number of mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus, most of which are strongly associated with specific RFLP or VNTR haplotypes. One of the major questions remaining in PKU research is why this apparently maladaptive disorder has been maintained at a frequency of approximately 1 in 10,000 among Caucasians. A growing number of studies have provided evidence that both the relatively high frequency of PKU and the strong mutation/haplotype associations might reflect the existence of multiple founding populations for PKU. Examples of putative founding populations for PKU in both Europe and Asia will be presented. Some PAH mutations are associated with multiple haplotypes, suggesting recurrence. Evidence for and against recurrence as the mechanism responsible for the association of the R408W mutation with RFLP haplotypes 1 and 2 will be discussed.","Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disorder inherited from both parents caused by many changes at the location of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) protein. It is a disorder in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy because it cannot process a molecule (phenylalanine). One of the main questions scientists still have is why PKU happens in roughly 1 in 10,000 white people at any point in time. More and more studies have suggested that both the high amount of the population with PKU at any point in time and the strong gene changes that go with this set of changes and variations might show more than one group of people in which PKU first developed. We will show populations thought to be where PKU first developed in both Europe and Asia. Some PAH changes go with many sets of gene variations, suggesting these changes happen more than once. We will discuss information that supports and rejects these changes happening more than once, causing one change to happen in two sets of gene changes.",

After positioning in either the supine or prone position, a cystoscopy is performed to place an open-ended catheter, occlusion balloon, or Accordian device into the collecting system. A foley catheter is placed in the bladder. An ultrasound with a curvilinear probe is used to survey the kidney and guide access into the collecting system with an 18 g percutaneous needle. Once access is obtained, a small 0.5 cm skin incision is made and the percutaneous tract is dilated over a wire. A 16.5F metallic or self-dilating suctioning access sheath is positioned with fluoroscopic guidance. A 12F rigid mini-PCNL nephroscope is used to evaluate the collecting system. Once a calculus is observed, options for stone fragmentation include a lithotripter with ultrasonic and ballistic energy, or laser lithotripsy using holmium or thulium laser fibers. Flexible ureteroscopy can be considered to ensure clearance of the collecting system. A 6F ureteral stent can be placed in either a retrograde or antegrade approach for drainage. The tract is sealed using Surgiflo hemostatic matrix with thrombin. Guidelines for postoperative care and troubleshooting techniques for mini-PCNL are reviewed along with the surgical steps in the accompanying video (Supplementary Video S1). There are few randomized trials comparing mini-PCNL with standard PCNL and ureteroscopy. There is some evidence to suggest a difference in transfusion rates comparing mini- and standard PCNL, as well as differences in stone-free rates when comparing mini-PCNL with ureteroscopy for the treatment of lower pole stones.","Mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL) is when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a small camera to help remove kidney stones. The mini-PNCL has become a useful tool to remove kidney stones of different sizes, stones that did not respond to other treatments, and it can also remove stones in the urinary tract, the body's drainage system to remove urine. When lying either flat on the back (supine position) or on the stomach and face down (prone position), a hollow tube with a lens is inserted into the urethra tube that goes to bladder to allow another device such as a catheter (a clean tube that goes into the bladder) into the collecting system which is the series of tubes and ducts of the kidney. A foley catheter (soft tube that is inserted into your bladder to drain urine) is placed in the bladder. An ultrasound (a technology that uses sound waves to take images of the inside the body) is used to look at the kidney and guide access to the collecting system with a needle.

12,18589845,"Asthma, which typically begins in childhood and is the most common chronic disease of childhood, has reached epidemic proportions. Asthma is associated with gene-environment interactions, and there is consensus that a ""window of opportunity"" exists early in life when environmental factors may influence its development. This review considers biologic and sociologic factors in the development of allergy and asthma. Meta-analysis of studies demonstrates that monoallergen reduction does not impact asthma prevention. However, multifaceted allergen reduction studies have shown clinical benefit. We propose that allergic diseases, including asthma, represent a dysfunctional interaction with our environment and that the increasing prevalence of asthma and allergy herald increased population risk for the development of other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Better understanding of the complex factors for asthma and allergies may provide insight into many other chronic complex diseases.","Asthma, which usually begins in childhood and is the most common chronic disease of childhood, has become very widespread. Asthma is connected with gene-environment interactions, which is when two different genes respond to something in the environment in different ways. There is agreement that there are certain times during pregnancy and early in a child's life when environmental factors (such as food, pollutants, and temperature) may shape asthma's development. This review considers biologic factors, such as brain chemistry, genes, nutrition, gender, and hormone levels, as well as sociologic factors, such as education and economic activity, in the development of allergies and asthma. Studies show that the strategy of decreasing exposure to one allergen (any substance that causes an allergic reaction) does not impact asthma prevention. However, decreasing exposure to more than one allergen has shown a positive effect, such as improved health or symptoms. It is suggested that asthma and other allergic diseases represent an error in how our genes and the environment interact. The increasing number of cases may be a sign that the general population is at risk for developing other inflammatory (when the body reacts to an injury or infection) and autoimmune diseases (where the body attacks healthy cells). A better understanding of the multiple factors that impact asthma and allergies may help researchers understand other chronic diseases.",
7,28730858,"Chronic GAS carrier state is best defined as the prolonged presence of group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) in the pharynx without evidence of infection or inflammation. Chronic GAS carriers have a low risk of immune mediated complications. Persistent pharyngeal carriage often raises management issues. In this study, we review the evidence on the management of persistent GAS carriage in children and propose a management algorithm. Areas covered: Chronic GAS pharyngeal carriage is quite common affecting 10-20% of school-aged children. Pathogenesis of carriage has been related to the pharynx microflora and to special properties of GAS, but several aspects are yet to be elucidated. Management greatly depends on whether the individual child belongs to a 'high-risk' group and might benefit from eradication regimens or not, when observation-only and reassurance are enough. Penicillin plus rifampin and clindamycin monotherapy have been recommended for eradication; limited evidence of effectiveness of azithromycin has been reported. Surgical intervention is not indicated. Expert commentary: GAS infection is a common reason for antibiotic use and abuse in children and asymptomatic carriers constitute the major reservoir of GAS in the community. Several aspects are yet to be elucidated and well-designed studies are needed for firm conclusions to be drawn.","Chronic GAS carrier state is defined as the long-term presence of group A strep (GAS) in the throat with no infection or inflammation. Chronic GAS carriers have a low risk of conditions that result from abnormal functioning of the body's immune system. Long-term GAS in the throat often causes treatment issues. In this study, we review the science on treating long-term GAS in children and suggest a way to treat it using computers. Long-term GAS in the throat is found in 10-20% of school-aged children. Whether or not GAS in the throat causes infection depends on small organisms in the throat and special qualities of GAS, but many things are not clear. Treating long-term GAS depends on whether the child is high-risk and might benefit from killing the bacteria or not, when a doctor looking at it and removing fears and concerns about the illness are enough. Combining antibiotics penicillin with rifampin and clindamycin in one drug has been recommended to kill GAS. There is not much proof that the antibiotic azithromycin works. Surgery is not recommended. Experts comment that GAS infection is a common reason for antibiotic use and overuse in children and people who have GAS without symptoms are the most common carriers in the community.

33,29018999,"The objective of this study was to perform population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of gabapentin in healthy Korean subjects and to investigate the possible effect of genetic polymorphisms (1236C > T, 2677G > T/A, and 3435C > T) of ABCB1 gene on PK parameters of gabapentin. Data were collected from bioequivalence studies, in which 173 subjects orally received three different doses of gabapentin (300, 400, and 800 mg). Only data from reference formulation were used. Population pharmacokinetics (PKs) of gabapentin was estimated using a nonlinear mixed-effects model (NONMEM). Gabapentin showed considerable inter-individual variability (from 5.2- to 8.7-fold) in PK parameters. Serum concentration of gabapentin was well fitted by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and lag time. An inhibitory Emax model was applied to describe the effect of dose on bioavailability. The oral clearance was estimated to be 11.1 L/h. The volume of distribution was characterized as 81.0 L. The absorption rate constant was estimated at 0.860 h-1, and the lag time was predicted at 0.311 h. Oral bioavailability was estimated to be 68.8% at dose of 300 mg, 62.7% at dose of 400 mg, and 47.1% at dose of 800 mg. The creatinine clearance significantly influenced on the oral clearance (P < 0.005) and ABCB1 2677G > T/A genotypes significantly influenced on the absorption rate constant (P < 0.05) of gabapentin. However, ABCB1 1236C > T and 3435C > T genotypes showed no significant effect on gabapentin PK parameters.

How the body handles and uses gabapentin is measured. Gabapentin shows a lot of variation or differences between people in how it is absorbed, distributed and released from the body. Blood concentration of gabapentin is used to understand the process of distributing and eliminating the medication from the body. How the dose amount impacts availability in the body is measured. The oral clearance is estimated to be 11.1 liters per hour. The volume of distribution was characterized as 81.0 L. How quickly the medication enters the body remains steady. Availability of the drug from the oral dose is estimated to be 68.8% at a dose of 300 mg, 62.7% at a dose of 400 mg, and 47.1% at a dose of 800 mg. Clearing creatinine (a waste product that comes from wear and tear of the muscles) influences the oral clearance, and ABCB1 genes influence how quickly gabapentin is absorbed by the body. However, genes showed no significant effect on gabapentin drug activity parameters. The results of this study suggest that the availability of gabapentin to the body when taken by mouth is decreased when the dosage is increased. In addition, changes in the ABCB1 gene can explain the major differences in how gabapentin is absorbed by the body between people.",
24,8588056,"1. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects and abrupt discontinuation of buspirone 15 or 20 mg tid and lorazepam 3 or 4 mg tid following 8 weeks of treatment. A total of 43 outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder were included in the study and 39 entered the withdrawal phase. 2. Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks (active phase) and after 9 and 10 weeks (withdrawal phase). These included the Hamilton anxiety scale, the visual analogue scale, the CHESS 84 (a check list for the evaluation of somatic symptoms) and the Lader tranquilizer withdrawal scale (translated in french). 3. Results show similar efficacy for lorazepam and buspirone during the active phase with a higher significant difference for buspirone on the CHESS 84 in relation with neurovegetatives symptoms: lorazepam D0 :16.30 +/- 3.14 D56: 5.10 +/- 0.93 (p < or = 0.01) buspirone D0 :18.82 +/- 3.4 D56: 4.73 +/- 1.18 (p < or = 0.001). No withdrawal phenomena was observed for both drugs using HAM-A lorazepam D63 :12.59 +/- 2.26 D70: 12.0 +/- 1.75 (p = ns) buspirone D63 :10.05 +/- 1.28 D70: 10.32 +/- 1.82 (p = ns) and the same significant difference using Lader scale: lorazepam D63 :4.44 +/- 0.89 D70: 6.96 +/- 1.28 (p < or = 0.05) buspirone D63 :2.95 +/- 0.66 D70: 4.15 +/- 0.92 (p < or = 0.05) 4. This study confirmed that buspirone was as effective as lorazepam at D56 in monitored outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder. There are some evidences that these two drugs differed in efficacy against the various somatic symptoms encountered in generalized anxiety disorder.","This study's purpose was to compare the effects and sudden termination of buspirone 15 or 20 mg three times a day and lorazepam 3 or 4 mg three times a day, common anxiety-reducing drugs. We included 43 patients outside the hospital with generalized anxiety disorder in the study, and 39 quickly stopped taking medication. We collected information from patients at the beginning of the study, at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks (active phase), and after 9 and 10 weeks (withdrawal phase). These assessments included common questionnaires measuring severity of anxiety symptoms. Results show lorazepam and buspirone worked similarly well during the active phase with one questionnaire favoring buspirone for physical symptoms of anxiety (e.g., fatigue). No withdrawal symptoms were seen for both lorazepam and buspirone using one of the questionnaires, and the same significant difference was seen using another questionnaire. This study showed that buspirone worked as well as lorazepam 56 days into the study in patients with generalized anxiety disorder. Some results suggest that lorazepam and buspirone did not work the same against the physical symptoms seen in generalized anxiety disorder.","This study compares the effects and abrupt stoppage of anxiety-reducing buspirone drug use (15 or 20 mg three times a day) and anxiety-reducing lorazepam drug use (3 or 4 mg three times a day) after 8 weeks of treatment. 43 patients with diagnosed anxiety participated in the study. 39 entered the drug withdrawal phase. Clinical measurements were taken at start, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks (active phase) and after 9 and 10 weeks (withdrawal phase). Lorazepam and buspirone had similar effectiveness when used. However, buspirone affected sleep, appetite, and concentration differently compared to lorazepam. No withdrawal effects were seen with either drug. Buspirone was as effective as lorazepam with patients with diagnosed anxiety. Buspirone may have differed in effectiveness compared to lorazepam for treating certain physical symptoms common with anxiety disorder."
55,16935966,"Evidence is put forward to suggest that myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, may be associated with persistent viral infection. In turn, such infections are likely to impair the ability of the body to biosynthesise n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids by inhibiting the delta-6 desaturation of the precursor essential fatty acids--namely, alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid. This would, in turn, impair the proper functioning of cell membranes, including cell signalling, and have an adverse effect on the biosynthesis of eicosanoids from the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. These actions might offer an explanation for some of the symptoms and signs of myalgic encephalomyelitis. A potential therapeutic avenue could be offered by bypassing the inhibition of the enzyme delta-6-desaturase by treatment with virgin cold-pressed non-raffinated evening primrose oil, which would supply gamma-linolenic acid and lipophilic pentacyclic triterpenes, and with eicosapentaenoic acid. The gamma-linolenic acid can readily be converted into dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and thence arachidonic acid, while triterpenes have important free radical scavenging, cyclo-oxygenase and neutrophil elastase inhibitory activities. Furthermore, both arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid are, at relatively low concentrations, directly virucidal.","Scientific evidence suggests that myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome or long-lasting tiredness, may be associated with persistent viral infection. These infections may impair the body's ability to biosynthesize (create) fatty acids by inhibiting (blocking) the enzymatic reaction associated with essential fatty acids. This would, in turn, impair the proper functioning of cell membranes (cell boundaries), including cell signaling, and have an adverse effect on the biosynthesis of signaling molecules. These actions might offer an explanation for some of the symptoms and signs of myalgic encephalomyelitis. A potential treatment could be found in virgin cold-pressed primrose oil. The oil would supply gamma-linolenic acid and lipophilic pentacyclic triterpenes (specific fatty substances). The resulting acid and triterpenes would be further converted into beneficial compounds. Furthermore, the resulting compounds are virucidal or can destroy inactive viruses.",

Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of nighttime orthoses on the second or third finger of the dominant hand in controlling pain in women with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) in the interphalangeal joint. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Outpatient clinic. Participants: Fifty-two women with symptomatic OA and presence of Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes, allocated randomly to the intervention group or the control group. Intervention: The intervention group used a nighttime orthosis on the second or third finger of the dominant hand. Both groups participated in an educational session. Outcomes and measures: The following parameters were measured: pain (numerical rating scale, Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index), grip and pinch strength, function (Cochin Hand Functional Scale), and manual performance (Moberg Pick Up Test). Results: The intervention group showed a statistically significant improvement in pain (p < .001) and hand function. The improvement in pain correlated with Cochin Hand Functional Scale scores and the absence of Bouchard's nodes in the third finger, which are predictors of the best prognosis for treatment with a nighttime orthosis. Conclusions and relevance: This study demonstrates that nighttime orthoses are effective in reducing pain and lead to improvement in hand function in women with hand OA. They are therefore specifically recommended for nonpharmacological treatment of hand OA. What this article adds: Orthoses can be considered, together with manual exercises and joint protection, as an intervention to reduce symptoms and improve hand function in people with hand OA. This study is an important step in empowering occupational therapists to determine appropriate and effective intervention for clients with OA.","Hand osteoarthritis is a musculoskeletal problem involving hand pain, stiffness, practical limitation, decreased grip strength, and reduced quality of life. The objective is to measure the use of nighttime braces on the second or third finger of the dominant hand in controlling pain in women with typical osteoarthritis (OA) in the finger knuckles.  Fifty-two women with typical OA and bony lumps in the finger knucles were randomly assigned to the treatment group or the control group. The treatment group used a nighttime brace on the second or third finger of the dominant hand. Both groups took part in an informational session. Pain, grip and pinch strength, funciton, and manual performance were measured. The treatment group showed a noticeable improvement in pain and hand function. The improvement in pain paralleled functionality test scores and the loss of bony lumps in the third finger. They are predictors of the best recovery for treatment with a nighttime brace. Nighttime braces are useful in reducing pain and improving hand function in women with hand osteoarthritis. They are recommended for non-medication treatment of hand osteoarthritis. Braces can be used, along with hand exercises and joint protection, to reduce symptoms and improve hand function in people with hand osteoarthritis. This study can help occupational therapists, who help patients perform everyday activities, choose useful treatments for those with osteoarthritis.","Hand osteoarthritis is a problem that is associated with hand pain, stiffness, inability to perform normal functional movements, decreased grip strength, and reduced quality of life. A nighttime orthosis is a device or brace worn at night that supports weak or damaged muscles and limits motion of the wrist. The objective of this study is to evaluate how helpful using nighttime orthoses on the second or third finger of the dominant hand is in controlling pain in women who have osteoarthritis in the hinge joint of the fingers. This study used a randomized controlled trial, a type of study that randomly assigns participants to one of two groups: the intervention group that is receiving the treatment or the comparison group not receiving treatment. The study took place in an outpatient clinic away from a hospital. Fifty-two women with osteoarthritis and who also had bony bumps (also called nodes) on the finger joints closest to the fingernail and in the middle of the finger were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the comparison group. The intervention group used a nighttime orthosis on the second or third finger of the dominant hand. Both groups participated in an educational session. The following were measured in both groups: pain (using a numbered scale), grip and pinch strength, function (measuring the ability to move and use the hand for daily activities), and manual performance (using a timed test that involves picking up, holding, and operating small objects). The intervention group (group that used the orthoses) showed a significant improvement in pain and hand function. The improvement in pain matched with measures of movement and the absence of nodes in the middle of the finger on the third finger. This study shows that nighttime orthoses are effective in reducing pain and lead to improvement in hand function in women with hand osteoarthritis. They are therefore specifically recommended for treatment of hand osteoarthritis that does not involve medications.

39,34569949,"Background: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. However, clinical feature of PPA based on Aβ positivity remains unclear. Objective: We aimed to assess the prevalence of Aβ positivity in patients with PPA and compare the clinical characteristics of patients with Aβ-positive (A+) and Aβ-negative (A-) PPA. Further, we applied Aβ and tau classification system (AT system) in patients with PPA for whom additional information of in vivo tau biomarker was available. Methods: We recruited 110 patients with PPA (41 semantic [svPPA], 27 non-fluent [nfvPPA], 32 logopenic [lvPPA], and 10 unclassified [ucPPA]) who underwent Aβ-PET imaging at multi centers. The extent of language impairment and cortical atrophy were compared between the A+ and A-PPA subgroups using general linear models. Results: The prevalence of Aβ positivity was highest in patients with lvPPA (81.3%), followed by ucPPA (60.0%), nfvPPA (18.5%), and svPPA (9.8%). The A+ PPA subgroup manifested cortical atrophy mainly in the left superior temporal/inferior parietal regions and had lower repetition scores compared to the A-PPA subgroup. Further, we observed that more than 90%(13/14) of the patients with A+ PPA had tau deposition. Conclusion: Our findings will help clinicians understand the patterns of language impairment and cortical atrophy in patients with PPA based on Aβ deposition. Considering that most of the A+ PPA patents are tau positive, understanding the influence of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers on PPA might provide an opportunity for these patients to participate in clinical trials aimed for treating atypical Alzheimer's disease.","Pimary progressive aphasia (PPA), a language and speech brain disorder, is linked with amyloid-β (Aβ), a brain protein segment associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, symptoms of PPA based on Aβ presence is unclear.

We also classified Aβ and tau type in PPA patients with this available information. We had 110 PPA patients (41 who can't understand words [svPPA], 27 who can't speak but understand words [nfvPPA], 32 who have trouble finding the right word [lvPPA], and 10 unclassified [ucPPA]) undergo Aβ imaging at multiple centers.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology is the accumulation of protein plaques in the brain. However, diagnosis of PPA based on Aβ positivity (presence) remains unclear. The goal of this paper was to determine the prevalence (frequency) of Aβ positivity in patients with PPA. The paper also aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of patients with Aβ-positive (A+) and Aβ-negative (A- or no presence of Aβ) PPA. Additionally the authors applied the Aβ and tau classification system (AT system) in patients with PPA. However, this was only done for patients with available information of a tau (a type of protein) biomarker. Biomarkers are measurable, biological substances that can indicate disease in a patient. This study recruited 110 patients with PPA. Of the 110 patients, there were four PPA groups: 41 semantic [svPPA], 27 non-fluent [nfvPPA], 32 logopenic [lvPPA], and 10 unclassified [ucPPA]). Semantic PPA is characterized by loss of language function. Non-fluent PPA is characterized by the gradual loss of speech. Logopenic PPA is characterized by difficulty in naming and sentence repetition. All recruits underwent Aβ-PET (brain scan) imaging at multi centers. The extent of language impairment and cortical atrophy, or brain degeneration, were compared between the A+ and A-PPA subgroups. The prevalence of Aβ positivity was highest in patients with lvPPA, followed by ucPPA, nfvPPA, and svPPA, respectively. The A+ PPA subgroup had cortical atrophy (damage) mainly in the left brain regions and had lower repetition scores when compared to the A- PPA subgroup. The authors observed that >90% of the recruits with A+ PPA had tau or protein deposition.

11,32654164,"Metabolic epilepsies arise in the context of rare inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), notably glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, and mitochondrial cytopathies. A common feature of these disorders is impaired bioenergetics, which through incompletely defined mechanisms result in a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, such as epileptic seizures, developmental delay, and movement disorders. The ketogenic diet (KD) has been successfully utilized to treat such conditions to varying degrees. While the mechanisms underlying the clinical efficacy of the KD in IEM remain unclear, it is likely that the proposed heterogeneous targets influenced by the KD work in concert to rectify or ameliorate the downstream negative consequences of genetic mutations affecting key metabolic enzymes and substrates-such as oxidative stress and cell death. These beneficial effects can be broadly grouped into restoration of impaired bioenergetics and synaptic dysfunction, improved redox homeostasis, anti-inflammatory, and epigenetic activity. Hence, it is conceivable that the KD might prove useful in other metabolic disorders that present with epileptic seizures. At the same time, however, there are notable contraindications to KD use, such as fatty acid oxidation disorders. Clearly, more research is needed to better characterize those metabolic epilepsies that would be amenable to ketogenic therapies, both experimentally and clinically. In the end, the expanded knowledge base will be critical to designing metabolism-based treatments that can afford greater clinical efficacy and tolerability compared to current KD approaches, and improved long-term outcomes for patients.","Metabolic epilepsies (a disorder that disturbs brain and nerve activity and causes seizures) are present with rare, inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), especially with deficiencies of certain energy-monitoring molecules. These disorders commonly include weakened energy-monitoring processes, which lead to a range of nerve-related effects, including epileptic seizures, growth delay, and movement disorders. The ketogenic diet (KD) (a low-carb diet) has successfully treated these conditions to some effect. While the reasons for the usefulness of KD or low-carb diets in inborn errors of metabolism is unclear, it may be because certain targets of KD work together to improve the negative effects from gene sequence changes affecting key metabolic particles, cell stress, and cell death. These helpful effects can be grouped into restoration of weakened energy-monitoring processes and nerve-related damage, improved electrical balance, anti-inflammation, and gene-related activity. Therefore, it is possible that KD may help other metabolic disorders with epileptic seizures. However, there are issues with KD use, including fat breakdown disorders. More research is needed to explain metabolic epilepsies (disorders that disturbe brain and nerve activity and cause seizures) that may be treated with low-carb treatments. Ultimately, this new knowledge will be useful to design metabolic treatments that can further help patients compared to current KD approaches, with better long-term outcomes for patients.","Metabolic epilepsies (seizures) arise in the context of rare hereditary or inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and can be caused in rare disorders. A common feature of these disorders is they cause brain-related symptoms, such as epileptic seizures, developmental delay (delays in reaching language, thinking, social, or motor skills), and movement disorders. The ketogenic diet, a low-carb/high-fat diet, has been successfully used to treat such conditions. How a ketogenic diet exactly impacts inborn errors of metabolism is not known, but it is likely that they influence the negative impacts of genetic mutations. Benefits of a ketogenic diet are broadly grouped into restoration of parts of metabolism that are impaired, improved maintenance of cells and cells processes, reduced pain and swelling, and processes that control gene activity without changing the DNA. It is possible that a ketogenic diet may be useful in other disorders of metabolism that include epileptic seizures. At the same time, there are some disorders where ketogenic diets should be avoided. More research is needed to better describe metabolic epilepsies that would benefit from a ketogenic diet. Expanding knowledge will be important to design metabolism-based treatments."
41,32659844,"This consensus-based guideline was developed by all relevant German pediatric medical societies. Ultrasound is the standard imaging modality for pre- and postnatal kidney cysts and should also exclude extrarenal manifestations in the abdomen and internal genital organs. MRI has selected indications. Suspicion of a cystic kidney disease should prompt consultation of a pediatric nephrologist. Prenatal management must be tailored to very different degrees of disease severity. After renal oligohydramnios, we recommend delivery in a perinatal center. Neonates should not be denied renal replacement therapy solely because of their age. Children with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney do not require routine further imaging or nephrectomy, but long-term nephrology follow-up (as do children with uni- or bilateral kidney hypo-/dysplasia with cysts). ARPKD (autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease), nephronophthisis, Bardet-Biedl syndrome and HNF1B mutations cause relevant extrarenal disease and genetic testing is advisable. Children with tuberous sclerosis complex, tumor predisposition (e. g. von Hippel Lindau syndrome) or high risk of acquired kidney cysts should have regular ultrasounds. Even asymptomatic children of parents with ADPKD (autosomal dominant PKD) should be monitored for hypertension and proteinuria. Presymptomatic diagnostic ultrasound or genetic examination for ADPKD in minors should only be done after thorough counselling. Simple cysts are very rare in children and ADPKD in a parent should be excluded. Complex renal cysts require further investigation.","This guideline was developed by all relevant German pediatric medical societies, which are groups that represent medical professionals that focus on pediatric or child-concerned medicine. An ultrasound is a type of x-ray to see images inside the body and is the common method to view kidney cysts (growths) before and after birth. This method can also exclude cysts in the stomach (abdomen) and inside the genitals. An MRI also takes images of the body and may also be needed in some cases. Suspicion of a cystic kidney disease should lead to consulting a kidney specialist of children. Care provided during pregnancy should align with how serious the disease is and will be slightly different for each patient. Oligohydramnios occur when there is too little amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb) and can sometimes be caused by kidney dysfunction. With this condition, it is recommended that delivery occurs in a birth-delivering center where specialty care is available. Newborns should not be denied therapy that replaces the normal blood-filtering function of the kidneys just because of their age. Children with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney, where one kidney is large with cysts and is not functioning, do not require routine x-rays or surgery to remove one or both kidneys. However they will need long-term follow-up with kidney specialists (as do children with other kidney problems where one or both kidneys are not working well and have cysts). Certain diseases such as ARPKD (autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease - an inherited kidney disease with cysts), nephronophthisis (kidney scarring), and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (a full-body, inherited disease), as well as genetic changes, cause disease outside the kidney, and genetic testing for these conditions is recommended. Children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC - a rare disease that leads to noncancerous tumors forming in the body) or a high risk of developing tumors or kidney cysts should have regular ultrasounds to take images of the inside of the body. Even children of parents with ADPKD (autosomal dominant PKD) who do not have symptoms should be monitored for high blood pressure and increased levels of protein in the urine. Testing for ADPKD in minors using an ultrasound or genetic testing should only be done after a great deal of counseling. Simple cysts are very rare in children, and ADPKD in a parent should be excluded. Complex kidney cysts require more investigation.","All relevant German child-care medical groups created the agreed-upon guideline. Ultrasound or sound-wave imaging is the standard imaging for pre- and post-birth kidney cysts (fluid-filled swellings) and should exclude non-kidney growths in the abdomen and genitals. Magnetic resonance imaging or imaging with radio waves and magnetic fields has selected uses. Suspicion of a kidney disease with cysts should prompt talking with a child-care kidney specialist. Pre-birth management should be personalized to different degress of disease severity. After renal oligohydramnios (diseases where scarce fluid surrounds the fetus due to kidney damage), we recommend delivery in a preganancy-specialized center. Newborns should not be denied kidney replacement therapy because of age. Children with a single, enlarged, nonfunctional kidney with cysts do not need regular imaging or kidney removal, but long-term kidney-related follow-ups (as do children with single or multiple kidney abnormalities with cysts). ARPKD (autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease), an inherited disorder of many kidney cysts, nephronophthisis (kidney inflammation), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (an inherited disorder that impairs kidneys, eyes, and more), and specific liver-related gene mutations cause disease outside the kidneys. Genetic testing is advisable. Children with an inherited disorder leading to tumors in the skin, brain, kidney and more, or a high risk of tumors (e.g. von Hippel Lindau syndrome) or kidney cysts should have regular ultrasounds. Even children without symptoms and of parents with ADPKD (a similar variant of ARPKD) should be monitored for high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Examining for ADPKD in minors via ultrasound or genes should only be done after in-depth counseling. Simple fluid-filled sacs are very rare in children. ADPDK in parents should be excluded.

Authors' conclusions: The studies included in this review provided mostly low- or very low-certainty evidence about the use of first aid interventions for acute oral poisoning. A key limitation was the fact that only one included study actually took place in a pre-hospital setting, which undermines our confidence in the applicability of these results to this setting.

36,34603756,"The introduction of technologically advanced methods of lithotripsy into medical practice changes the nature of postoperative complications. Among them, the main complications are inflammatory infections. This largely determines the search for new, improved methods of stone fragmentation avoiding small stone fragments and dissemination of the pelvicalyceal system of the kidney with stone-associated infection. The authors have developed a method for controlled stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a hot-spot effect at the optical fiber end. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of controlled urinary stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a highly heated distal end of the optical fiber light guide as a method of preventing inflammatory infections in clinical practice. Materials and methods: We analyzed 1666 case histories of urolithiasis patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotripsy/ nephrolithoextraction and contact ureterolithotripsy/ureteroextraction, we also performed a prospective analysis of complications based on the Clavien-Dindo classification in 90 patients who underwent fine fragmentation of stones with various lithotripters: ultrasonic, pneumatic, and holmium laser. The method of controlled stone fragmentation by a diode laser with a hot-spot effect was tested on postoperative samples of 26 renal calculi. For the first time in clinical practice, this method was tested in the bladder cavity (n=10). Results: In the percutaneous nephrolithotripsy group, postoperative infectious and inflammatory complications occurred in 34.1% of cases, in the percutaneous nephrolithoextraction group - in 24.6%, in the contact ureterolithotripsy group - in 7.8%, in the ureterolithoextraction group - in 2.5%. The analysis made it possible to identify factors promoting the development of infectious and inflammatory complications. For the first time in clinical practice, there were successfully performed ten operations of stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a hot-spot effect. Controlled coarse fragmentation of stones providing the possibility to reduce the number of infectious and inflammatory complications was performed in the bladder as a model for testing the method. Conclusion: The method of laser-induced controlled coarse fragmentation of stones with a hot-spot effect, developed and tested in clinical practice, is promising for the prevention of infectious and inflammatory complications in patients with potentially infected stones since their fine fragmentation and, consequently, spread of stone-associated toxins and microflora within the urinary system is avoided.","New advanced technology for breaking up stones in the kidney and the tube to the bladder changes the nature of issues after operation. Among them, the main issues are inflammatory infections. This influences the search for new, improved ways of breaking up stones to avoid small fragments and spreading stone-associated infection in the kidney and bladder system. We have created a method for controlled breaking up of stones with a special laser with a hot-spot at one end. This study evaluates the effectiveness of controlled breaking up of stones in urine using a special laser with a hot-spot at one end to prevent inflammatory infections in clinics. We analyzed 1666 patient cases of patients with kidney stones who had operations to remove the stones in the kidney and urine. We also analyzed any complications in 90 patients who had treatment with various devices to break up stones: sound waves, pressurized air, and lasers. The method of controlled breaking up of stones with a special laser with a hot-spot was tested on 26 kidney stone samples collected after surgery. For the first time in clinical practice, this method was tested in the hole in the bladder of 10 patients. In the group that had a small cut to remove kidney stones, infections and inflammatory issues after surgery occured in 34.1% of cases. In the group that had a cut and small tube to remove stones, infections and issues occured in 24.6%. In the group that had a small cut to remove stones in the urine, infections and issues occured in 7.8%. In the group that had a cut and tube to remove stones, infections and issues occured in 2.5%. The analysis helped identify factors that promoted infectious and inflammatory issues. For the first time in clinical practice, there were 10 successful operations of breaking up stones with a special laser with a hot-spot. Controlled breaking up of stones, which may reduce the number of infectious and inflammatory effects, was done in the bladder to test the method. The method of using a laser with a hot-spot to break up stones, developed and tested in clinical practice, may prevent infectious and inflammatory effects in patients with possibly infected stones since their previous stone fragmentation. This method may also prevent spread of stone-associated toxins and bacteria in the urinary system.","Introducing lithotripsy, a non-surgical method to break masses like kidney stones into pieces, into medical practice changes the type of complications that may occur after operations. The main complications are inflammatory infections that may result in pain, redness, or swelling. New and improved methods of breaking down stones, avoiding small stone fragments and sending them through the kidneys to be released through urine are searched. The authors develop a method to break stones using a continuous-wave diode laser, which is a constant stream of laser light that can also reduce the scattering of stones by using a hot-spot or energy-focused effect. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of controlling the fragmenting of urinary stones (hard masses of minerals in the bladder), using a continuous-wave diode laser as a method of preventing inflammatory infections. Researchers analyzed 1666 cases of patients with kidney stones who underwent different methods to remove kidney stones. These methods include percutaneous nephrolithotripsy/nephrolithoextraction (removal of stones by a small incision through the skin and stones pulled out of the incision) and ureterolithotripsy/ureteroextraction (when a flexible tube is inserted through the bladder and the ureter which connects the kidneys and bladder and stones are found with a camera and removed). An additional analysis on 90 patients is also done on patients with stones that were fragmented into tiny pieces using different lithotripters, non-surgical devices that crush stones using shock waves. The method of controlled stone fragmentation by a diode laser with a hot-spot effect is tested on samples of 26 kidney stones during or after operations. For the first time in clinical practice, this method is tested in the bladder (with 10 patients). In the group that underwent a small incision to remove the stone, infections and inflammation complications after the procedure occurred in 34.1% of cases. In the group that had stones removed from the incision (nephrolithoextraction) had complications in 24.6%, and in the ureterolithotripsy group where a tube and camera are used, there are 7.8% cases with complications. In the ureterolithoextraction group, there are complications in 2.5%. The analysis makes it possible to find things that lead to the development of infectious or inflammatory complications. For the first time, there are successfully performed ten operations of stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a hot-spot effect. Controlling the scattering of fragments of stones makes it possible to reduce the number of infectious and inflammatory complications and is done in the bladder as an example for testing this method. In conclusion, using a laser to control fragmented stones with the hot spot effect is a promising way to prevent infection and inflammation complications in patients with possibly infected stones since small pieces of stones and their spread within the urinary system is avoided."
10,3068693,"The local, systemic, and referred causes of finger pain are generally recognizable by historical features and physical examination findings, although radiographs and laboratory evaluation are often required to support the diagnostic impression. Most minor traumatic causes of finger pain require only conservative management, including immobilization followed by exercise. Infectious causes of finger pain include cellulitis, tendinitis, paronychia, felon, and infectious emboli, which generally require antibiotics with or without drainage. Certain patients with finger pain resulting from infection should be referred to a hand surgeon. Vascular and ischemic causes of finger pain represent true emergencies, because tissue viability is dependent on prompt intervention. Whereas any sensory neuropathy may present with finger pain, carpal tunnel syndrome is among the most common. Systemic rheumatic disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or vasculitis, may begin with finger pain. In addition, such pain may be the first manifestation of a serious systemic illness, as in hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is an example of referred pain, presumably by way of neural mechanisms. Certain infectious, traumatic, and ischemic causes of finger pain must be diagnosed promptly to avoid significant morbidity; depending upon the cause of the symptoms, referral to a hand surgeon, rheumatologist, or neurologist may be appropriate. Symptomatic and functional improvement may also be hastened by the input of an occupational therapist.","The causes of finger pain can usually be found by learning about the duration and severity of the problem and doing a physical examination. However, x-rays and lab tests are often used to identify the cause of the pain. Most minor traumatic injuries that cause finger pain only need non-invasive (no surgery) therapy, such as resting followed by exercise. Finger pain caused by an infection (germs that build in the body causing illness) usually require medicines that fight bacteria called antibiotics. A process called drainage that removes extra fluid from a wound is sometimes used with antibiotics. Sometimes patients with finger pain from an infection will see a hand surgeon. Limited or no blood flow to or through the tissues in the finger can cause finger pain, are signs of a true emergency, and require immediate attention to prevent more damage to the tissues. Patients with nerve damage may have finger pain. Carpal tunnel syndrome (pain or tingling in the hand or arm caused by a pinched wrist nerve) is a common example of pain caused by nerve damage. Diseases that can cause your immune system to attack your joints, muscles, bones and organs (called systemic rheumatic diseases) can begin with finger pain. In addition, finger pain may be the first sign of a more serious illness, such as in hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (a rare disease with irritation around the bone and enlarged fingertips). Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (a disease causing long-lasting pain in one or more limbs) is an example of when an injury in one part to the body causes pain in a different part of the body. Certain infections, traumatic injuries, and blood flow problems that cause finger pain must be identified quickly to prevent long-term or more serious damage. In some cases, going to a hand surgeon, a rheumatologist (doctor who treats arthritis and other joint, muscle, and bone diseases), or a neurologist (brain and nerve doctor) is needed. Progress in reducing pain and improving movement in the finger may come faster with the help of an occupational therapist, people who help patients with injuries, illnesses, and disabilities build or restore their abilities to do everyday tasks in life.","Causes of finger pain are usually recognizable by past characteristics and findings from a physical checkup. However, radiographs (images created usually by x-rays) and other lab tests are usually required to support the identification. Most minor causes of finger pain need only mild treatment, like restraining the finger from moving and exercise. Causes of finger pain from bacteria include cellulitis (a bacterial skin infection), tendinitis (an irritation of the tendon), paronychia (a bacterial nail infection), felon (a bacterial fingertip infection), and emboli (a blood vessel blockage). These causes generally require antibacterials alomg with or without fluid drainage of the finger. Some patients with finger pain from bacteria should be sent to a hand surgeon. Causes of finger pain related to blood vessels represent real emergencies that depend on quick treatment. When any nerve damage leads to finger pain, a pinched nerve in the wrist is usually the most common. Full-body autoimmune diseases (diseases in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells), which may cause joint pain or irritation in the blood vessels, might start with finger pain. Also, finger pain may be the first sign of a serious full-body illness, as in hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, a rare disease with irritation around the bone and joints and enlarged fingertips. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (a disease causing long-lasting limb pain) is an example of pain felt in an area away from its source, possibly by nerve signaling issues. Some bacteria-related, injury-related, and blood vessel-related causes of finger pain must be checked quickly to avoid serious harm. Depending on the cause, help from a hand surgeon, rheumatologist (a doctor who treats musculoskeletal issues), or neurologist (a doctor who treats nerve-related issues) may be needed. Recovery may be quickened with occupational therapists that help patients perform everyday activities."
47,26783040,"Background: Low serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are a hallmark of hypophosphatasia. However, the clinical significance and the underlying genetics of low ALP in unselected populations are unclear. Methods: In order to clarify this issue, we performed a clinical, biochemical and genetic study of 42 individuals (age range 20-77yr) with unexplained low ALP levels. Results: Nine had mild hyperphosphatemia and three had mild hypercalcemia. ALP levels were inversely correlated with serum calcium (r=-0.38, p=0.012), pyridoxal phosphate (PLP; r=-0.51, p=0.001) and urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA; r=-0.49, p=0.001). Although many subjects experienced minor complaints, such as mild musculoskeletal pain, none had major health problems. Mutations in ALPL were found in 21 subjects (50%), including six novel mutations. All but one, were heterozygous mutations. Missense mutations were the most common (present in 18 subjects; 86%) and the majority were predicted to have a damaging effect on protein activity. The presence of a mutated allele was associated with tooth loss (48% versus 12%; p=0.04), slightly lower levels of serum ALP (p=0.002), higher levels of PLP (p<0.0001) and PEA (p<0.0001), as well as mildly increased serum phosphate (p=0.03). Ten individuals (24%) had PLP levels above the reference range; all carried a mutated allele. Conclusion: One-half of adult individuals with unexplained low serum ALP carried an ALPL mutation. Although the associated clinical manifestations are usually mild, in approximately 50% of the cases, enzyme activity is low enough to cause substrate accumulation and may predispose to defects in calcified tissues.","Low serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are a sign of hypophosphatasia (genetic disease that affects bone and tooth development). ALP is an enzyme that helps bone strength. However, the clinical significance and the underlying genetics of low ALP in unselected populations are unclear. To better understand this issue, the authors performed a study of 42 individuals with unexplained low ALP levels. The participants were between 20 to 77 years old. Nine had mild hyperphosphatemia (high serum phosphate) and three had mild hypercalcemia (high blood calcium). ALP levels were inversely related with serum calcium, pyridoxal phosphate, and urine phosphoethanolamine. These are all compounds within the body that play a role in bone health. Many subjects experienced minor complaints, such as mild muscle or bone pain. However, none had major health problems. Mutations in ALPL were found in 21 subjects, including six novel mutations. All but one were heterozygous mutations, which is a mutation only affecting one form of a gene. Missense mutations, or mistakes in the DNA, were the most common. Most of the mutations were predicted to have a damaging effect on protein activity. The presence of a mutated allele was associated with tooth loss, slightly lower levels of serum (blood) ALP, higher levels of PLP and PEA, as well as mildly increased serum phosphate. Ten individuals had PLP levels above the reference range. All carried a mutated allele or gene copy. One-half of adult individuals with unexplained low serum ALP carried an ALPL mutation. In almost half of the cases, enzyme activity is low enough to cause substrate (cell substance) accumulation. This may make an individual more likely to experience defects in calcified tissues, such as bone.","Low blood levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a protein that influences the high-energy molecule phosphate, indicates low blood phosphate levels. However, the importance and genetics of low ALP in random groups is unknown. To clarify this issue, we performed a clinical, biochemical and genetic study of 42 individuals with unexplained low ALP levels. Nine had mildly high blood phosphate levels. Three had mildly high blood calcium levels. ALP levels trended oppositely with blood calcium, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) or active vitamin B6, and urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA), a key molecule to build cell boundaries. Although many had minor complains, like mild musculoskeletal pain, none had major health problems. Gene sequence changes in ALPL, the gene encoding ALP, were found in 21 subjects (50%), including six new changes. Mutations that change a protein segment were the most common (present in 18 subjects; 86%). The majority were predicted to have a harmful effect on protein activity. Having a mutated gene was linked with tooth loss, slightly lower levels of blood ALP, higher levels of PLP and PEA, and mildly higher blood phosphate. Ten people had above-average PLP levels. All had a mutated gene. Half of the adults with unexplained low blood ALP had an ALPL mutation. Although the associated physical symptoms are usually mild, in around 50% of the cases, protein enzyme activity is low enough to cause phosphate accumulation and may predispose to defects in high-calcium body parts."
12,28927818,"It has been 15 years since the first prevention of allergy (PAT) study was published, exploring the dream of the allergist: determining whether allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) can alter the natural course of disease and prevent the development of asthma in children with seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis. Two hundred five children aged 6 to 14 years with grass and/or birch pollen allergy were randomized to receive either allergen-specific injection immunotherapy with aluminum-adsorbed native allergen extract subcutaneous immunotherapy for 3 years or to an open control group. Subjects had moderate-to-severe hay fever symptoms, but none of them reported asthma at the time of inclusion. Actively treated children had significantly fewer asthma symptoms after 3 years, as evaluated by clinical diagnosis (odds ratio, 2.52; P < .05). Methacholine bronchial provocation test results were significantly better in the active group. Thus a 3-year course of injection AIT in children with hay fever to grass, birch pollen, or both significantly reduced the risk of asthma.","An early study on prevention of allergies aimed to determine if allergen-specific immunotherapy (allergy shots) can improve or prevent the development of asthma in children. In this study, 205 children aged 6 to 14 years with allergies to grass and/or birch pollen were randomly put in either the group that received an allergy shot of immunotherapy for 3 years or in a no-treatment group. None of the study participants reported having asthma at the time of the start of the study. Children treated with the allergy shot had much fewer asthma symptoms after 3 years. A test that measures how well the lungs are working were better in the group that received the allergy shot. Receiving an allergy shot over the course of 3 years in children with allergies to grass, birch pollen, or both greatly reduced the risk of asthma.","It has been 15 years since the first prevention of allergy study was published.

The medical community of the time did not embrace the maneuver right away. The American Red Cross (ARC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) continued to promoted backslaps for ten years after the introduction of the Heimlich maneuver.

41,17965720,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an important cause of end-stage renal disease, for which there is no proven therapy. Mutations in PKD1 (the gene encoding polycystin-1) are the principal cause of this disease. The disease begins in utero and is slowly progressive, but it is not known whether cystogenesis is an ongoing process during adult life. We now show that inactivation of Pkd1 in mice before postnatal day 13 results in severely cystic kidneys within 3 weeks, whereas inactivation at day 14 and later results in cysts only after 5 months. We found that cellular proliferation was not appreciably higher in cystic specimens than in age-matched controls, but the abrupt change in response to Pkd1 inactivation corresponded to a previously unrecognized brake point during renal growth and significant changes in gene expression. These findings suggest that the effects of Pkd1 inactivation are defined by a developmental switch that signals the end of the terminal renal maturation process. Our studies show that Pkd1 regulates tubular morphology in both developing and adult kidney, but the pathologic consequences of inactivation are defined by the organ's developmental status. These results have important implications for clinical understanding of the disease and therapeutic approaches.","An inherited disorder of many kidney cysts (swellings) is an important cause of kidney failure, for which there is no treatment. Gene sequence changes in PKD1 (a gene active in kidney cells) are the leading cause of the disease. The disease begins before birth and worsens slowly, but it is not known if creation of cysts is an ongoing process during adult life. We show that silencing of Pkd1 in mice younger than 13 days leads to severely cystic kidneys within 3 weeks. Silencing at day 14 or later results in cysts only after 4 months. We found that cell growth is not higher in those with cysts versus similar-age healthy animals, but the sudden change in response to Pkd1 silencing was linked to a new brake point during kidney growth and changes in gene expression. The effects of Pkd1 silencing may be defined by a developmental switch that signals the end of the final kidney maturation process. Pkd1 monitors development of tubes in growing and adult kidneys, but the disease-related effects of silencing are defined by the organ's developmental status. These results influence clinical understanding of the disease and treatment options.","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an inherited disease that causes many cysts (growths) usually in the kidneys, and is an important cause of end-stage kidney disease, for which there is no proven therapy. Changes in the PKD1 gene (which creates an active kidney protein) are the main causes of this disease. The disease begins before birth and develops slowly, but it is not known whether the development and growth of cysts is an ongoing process during adult life. When the Pkd1 gene is not active in mice within 13 days after birth, this results in many cysts in the kidneys within 3 weeks. However, inactivation (turning off) of Pkd1 at day 14 or later results in cysts only after 5 months. Researchers find that cell growth and development is not higher in samples of cysts than in comparison groups. However, the sudden change of Pkd1 becoming inactive matched a stopping point of kidney growth that is not previously recognized and matched significant changes in how the gene functions. These findings suggest that the effects of inactivating the Pkd1 gene are like a switch that signals the end of the end-stage kidney process. These studies show that Pkd1 regulates changes in both developing kidneys and in adult kidneys, but the process of inactivation are defined by the stage of the organ's development.

34,28434208,"Background: Dietary changes are routinely recommended in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on the basis of randomised evidence in the general population and non-randomised studies in CKD that suggest certain healthy eating patterns may prevent cardiovascular events and lower mortality. People who have kidney disease have prioritised dietary modifications as an important treatment uncertainty. Objectives: This review evaluated the benefits and harms of dietary interventions among adults with CKD including people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation. Main results: We included 17 studies involving 1639 people with CKD. Three studies enrolled 341 people treated with dialysis, four studies enrolled 168 kidney transplant recipients, and 10 studies enrolled 1130 people with CKD stages 1 to 5. Eleven studies (900 people) evaluated dietary counselling with or without lifestyle advice and six evaluated dietary patterns (739 people), including one study (191 people) of a carbohydrate-restricted low-iron, polyphenol enriched diet, two studies (181 people) of increased fruit and vegetable intake, two studies (355 people) of a Mediterranean diet and one study (12 people) of a high protein/low carbohydrate diet. Risks of bias in the included studies were generally high or unclear, lowering confidence in the results. Participants were followed up for a median of 12 months (range 1 to 46.8 months). Studies were not designed to examine all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events. In very-low quality evidence, dietary interventions had uncertain effects on all-cause mortality or ESKD. In absolute terms, dietary interventions may prevent one person in every 3000 treated for one year avoiding ESKD, although the certainty in this effect was very low. Across all 17 studies, outcome data for cardiovascular events were sparse. Dietary interventions in low quality evidence were associated with a higher health-related quality of life (2 studies, 119 people: MD in SF-36 score 11.46, 95% CI 7.73 to 15.18; I2 = 0%). Adverse events were generally not reported. Dietary interventions lowered systolic blood pressure (3 studies, 167 people: MD -9.26 mm Hg, 95% CI -13.48 to -5.04; I2 = 80%) and diastolic blood pressure (2 studies, 95 people: MD -8.95, 95% CI -10.69 to -7.21; I2 = 0%) compared to a control diet. Dietary interventions were associated with a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (5 studies, 219 people: SMD 1.08; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.97; I2 = 88%) and serum albumin levels (6 studies, 541 people: MD 0.16 g/dL, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.24; I2 = 26%). A Mediterranean diet lowered serum LDL cholesterol levels (1 study, 40 people: MD -1.00 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.56 to -0.44). Authors' conclusions: Dietary interventions have uncertain effects on mortality, cardiovascular events and ESKD among people with CKD as these outcomes were rarely measured or reported. Dietary interventions may increase health-related quality of life, eGFR, and serum albumin, and lower blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels. Based on stakeholder prioritisation of dietary research in the setting of CKD and preliminary evidence of beneficial effects on risks factors for clinical outcomes, large-scale pragmatic RCTs to test the effects of dietary interventions on patient outcomes are required.","Changes in diet are often recommended for people with chronic kidney disease on the basis of evidence in the general population and in other studies of chronic kidney disease. People who have kidney disease have prioritized changes in their diet as uncertain treatment. This review evaluates the benefits and harms of dietary interventions (changing diet and diet behavior to reach a health goal) among adults with chronic kidney disease, including people with end-stage kidney disease treated with dialysis (a process that uses a machine to clean the blood because the kidneys are not working) or kidney transplantation or donation. Researchers include 17 studies involving 1639 people with chronic kidney disease. Three studies include 341 people treated with dialysis, four studies have 168 kidney transplant recipients, and 10 studies have 1130 people with chronic kidney disease at stages ranging from 1 to 5. Among these studies, 11 evaluated dietary counselling with or without lifestyle advice, and 6 evaluated dietary patterns, including 1 study of a low-carb/low-iron with many plant-based foods diet, 2 studies of increased fruit and vegetable intake, 2 studies of a Mediterranean diet and 1 study of a high protein/low carb diet. Risks of bias in these studies are generally high or unclear, lowering confidence in how true the results are in these papers. Participants are followed up for about 12 months, but the time ranges between 1 to 46.8 months. Studies are not designed to examine all causes of illness or heart disease events. In very low quality evidence, dietary interventions or treatment have uncertain effects on deaths from any cause or end-stage kidney disease. Dietary interventions to treat kidney disease may prevent one person in every 3000 treated for one year to avoid end-stage kidney disease, although the certainty that this result will happen is very low. Across all 17 studies, outcome data for heart events are limited. Dietary interventions in low quality evidence studies are associated with a higher health-related quality of life. Adverse (unexpected and negative) events are generally not reported. In some studies, dietary interventions lowered systolic blood pressure (top blood pressure number) and diastolic blood pressure (bottom blood pressure number) compared to a control diet. Dietary interventions are associated with a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a blood test that measures removal of creatinine levels which are waste products from digestion and muscle breakdown. They are also linked to higher albumin (liver proteins that keep fluid in the bloodstream) levels in the blood. A Mediterranean diet lowered LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. In conclusion, dietary interventions have uncertain effects on death, heart events, and end-stage kidney disease among people with chronic kidney disease because these effects are rarely measured or described. Dietary interventions may increase health-related quality of life, eGFR, and albumin levels in the blood, and lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Large-scale clinical studies to test the effects of dietary interventions on patient outcomes are needed.","Diet changes are usually recommended in people with long-lasting or chronic kidney disease (CKD) since studies suggest certain healthy eating patterns may prevent heart-related events and lower deaths. People with kidney disease have important diet changes as a treatment uncertainty. This review explored the pros and cons of dietary treatment in adults with CKD including those with kidney failure treated with an artificial kidney machine or kidney transplant. We included 17 studies with 1639 people with CKD. Three studies used 341 people treated with an artifical kidney disease. Four studies had 168 kidney transplant receivers. 10 studies had 1130 people with low to severe CKD. Eleven studies (900 people) evaluated diet counselling with or without lifestyle advice. Six evaluated diet patterns (739 people), including one study (191 people) of a carb-restricted low-iron, high plant-nutrient diet, two studies (181 people) of increased fruit and vegetable intake, two studies (355 people) of a Mediterranean diet and one study (12 people) of a high protein/low carb diet. Risk of bias in the studies were generally high or unclear, casting doubts in the results. Participants were checked for an average of 12 months. Studies were not made to examine all-cause death or heart-related events. In very-low quality results, diet interventions had uncertain effects on all-cause deaths or kidney failure. In established results, diet treatments may prevent kidney failure in one in every 3000 people, although the certainty of this effect was very low. Across all 17 studies, outcome data for heart-related evens was rare. Diet treatments in low quality evidence was linked with a higher heart-related quality of life. Side effects were generally not reported. Diet treatments lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to a control or regular diet. Diet treatments were linked with a higher kidney filtration rate and blood levels of albumin, a blood protein. A Mediterranean diet lowered ""unwanted"" blood cholesterol levels. Diet treatments have uncertain effects on death, heart-related events, and kidney failure among people with CKD since these outcomes were rarely measured or reported. Diet treatment may increased health-related quality of life, kidney filtration rate, and blood albumin. Diet treatment may lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. Based on the importance of diet research for CKD and initial evidence of beneficial effects on health, large-scale studies to test the effects of diet treatments on patient outcomes are needed."
