27,33444297,"As of January 3, 2021, a total of 20,346,372 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 349,246 associated deaths have been reported in the United States. Long-term sequalae of COVID-19 over the course of a lifetime currently are unknown; however, persistent symptoms and serious complications are being reported among COVID-19 survivors, including persons who initially experience a mild acute illness.* On December 11, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to prevent COVID-19, administered as 2 doses separated by 21 days. On December 12, 2020, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation for use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (1); initial doses were recommended for health care personnel and long-term care facility residents (2). As of December 23, 2020, a reported 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in the United States, and reports of 4,393 (0.2%) adverse events after receipt of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had been submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Among these, 175 case reports were identified for further review as possible cases of severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that does occur rarely after vaccination, with onset typically within minutes to hours (3). Twenty-one cases were determined to be anaphylaxis (a rate of 11.1 per million doses administered), including 17 in persons with a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions, seven of whom had a history of anaphylaxis. The median interval from vaccine receipt to symptom onset was 13 minutes (range = 2-150 minutes). Among 20 persons with follow-up information available, all had recovered or been discharged home. Of the remaining case reports that were determined not to be anaphylaxis, 86 were judged to be nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, and 61 were considered nonallergic adverse events. Seven case reports were still under investigation. This report summarizes the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of case reports of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, after receipt of the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine during December 14-23, 2020, in the United States. CDC has issued updated interim clinical considerations for use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized in the United States (4) and interim considerations for preparing for the potential management of anaphylaxis (5). In addition to screening for contraindications and precautions before administering COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine locations should have the necessary supplies available to manage anaphylaxis, should implement postvaccination observation periods, and should immediately treat persons experiencing anaphylaxis signs and symptoms with intramuscular injection of epinephrine (4,5).","As of January 3, 2021, a total of 20,346,372 cases of Covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) and 349,246 deaths associated with Covid-19 have been reported in the United States. Long-lasting effects of Covid-19 over the course of a lifetime are currently unknown; however, continuing symptoms and serious complications are being reported by some Covid-19 survivors, including people who first have a mild acute (sudden) case. On December 11, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), which allows unapproved medicines to be used, for Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine to prevent Covid-19, administered as 2 doses separated by 21 days. A group of medical and public health experts called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issued a temporary recommendation in December 2020 for using the Pfizer vaccine; the first available doses were to be used for health care staff and people who lived in long-term care facilities. As of December 23, 2020, a reported 1,893,360 first shots of the Pfizer vaccine had been administered in the United States, and reports of 4,393 (0.2%) unexpected side effects (adverse events) after receiving the Pfizer vaccine had been submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national vaccine safety tracking system that accepts reports of adverse events after vaccination. Among these reports of adverse events, 175 case reports were identified for further review as possible cases of severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis - a life-threatening allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination and usually starts within minutes to hours of receiving the vaccine. There were 21 cases with anaphylaxis, including 17 in people with a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions, 7 of whom had a history of anaphylaxis. The average time between receiving the vaccine to the start of symptoms was 13 minutes, but the range of time for symptoms to start was between 2 minutes - 150 minutes. Among 20 people with follow-up information available, all had recovered or been sent home. Of the remaining case reports that were found not to have anaphylaxis, 86 cases were judged not to be anaphylaxis allergic reactions, and 61 were considered nonallergic adverse events. Seven case reports were still under investigation. This report summarizes the case reports of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, after receiving the first shot of the Pfizer vaccine during December 14-23, 2020, in the United States. CDC has issued updated temporary clinical guidance for use of Covid-19 vaccines currently allowed in the United States and temporary guidance for preparing for people who experience anaphylaxis. In addition to checking for reasons a person should not get the vaccine and precautions before giving the Covid-19 vaccines, the locations providing the vaccine should have necessary supplies if anaphylaxis occurs. Additionally, these locations should set aside time to observe people who receive the vaccine and should immediately treat people experiencing anaphylaxis signs and symptoms.","As of January 3, 2021, the United States has reported 20,346,372 cases of a breathing-related illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and 349,246 related deaths. Long-term consequences of COVID-19 over a lifetime are unknown. However, COVID-19 survivors, including those who initially had a mild, sudden illness, report persistent symptoms and serious issues. On December 11, 20202, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or approval for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to prevent COVID-19, given as 2 doses separated by 21 days. On December 12, 2020, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of health experts, gave an temporary recommendation for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (1). Initial doses were recommended for health care workers and long-term care residents (2). As of December 23, 2020, 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had been given in the United States. After people received the vaccine, reports of 4,393 (0.2%) unfortunate events were submitted to an official vaccine event tracking system. Among the unfortunate events, 175 individual patient reports were picked for further review as possible cases of severe allergic reaction, including life-threatening reactions. Anaplylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination, usually starting within minutes to hours (3). Twenty-one cases were identified as anaphylaxis (a rate of 11.1 per million doses given). These includ 17 in those with a noted history of allergies or allergic reactions, seven of whom had anaphylaxis before. The average interval from receiving the vaccine to experiencing symptoms was 13 minutes (ranging from 2 to 150 minutes). Among 20 people with follow-up information available, all had recovered or been sent home. Of the other case reports determined to not be anaphylaxis, 86 were noted to be nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions. 61 were considered nonallergic unfortunate events. Seven individual patient reports were still under investigation. This report summarizes the clinical and social characteristics of individual patient reports of alltergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis reactions, after receiving the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine during December 14-23, 2020 in the United States. The nation's health protection agency issued new clinical considerations for using mRNA COVID-19 vaccines currently allowed in the United States (4) and for preparaing for possibly managing analphylaxis (5). Along with testing for eligibility and safety measures before giving COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine locations should have the necessary supplies to manage anaphylaxis, enforce postvaccination observation periods, and immediately treat those experiencing anaphylaxis sign and symptoms with injections of epinephrine, first-aid medication for anaphylaxis (4, 5)."
28,34579572,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised concerns about the detrimental effects of antibodies. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is one of the biggest concerns in terms of not only the antibody reaction to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) upon reinfection with the virus but also the reaction to COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we evaluated ADE of infection by using COVID-19 convalescent-phase plasma and BHK cells expressing human Fcγ receptors (FcγRs). We found that FcγRIIA and FcγRIIIA mediated modest ADE of infection against SARS-CoV-2. Although ADE of infection was observed in monocyte-derived macrophages infected with SARS-CoV-2, including its variants, proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression was not upregulated in macrophages. SARS-CoV-2 infection thus produces antibodies that elicit ADE of infection, but these antibodies do not contribute to excess cytokine production by macrophages. IMPORTANCE Viruses infect cells mainly via specific receptors at the cell surface. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is an alternative mechanism of infection for viruses to infect immune cells that is mediated by antibodies and IgG receptors (FcγRs). Because ADE of infection contributes to the pathogenesis of some viruses, such as dengue virus and feline coronavirus, it is important to evaluate the precise mechanism of ADE and its contribution to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using convalescent-phase plasma from COVID-19 patients, we found that two types of FcγRs, FcγRIIA and FcγRIIIA, mediate ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although ADE of infection was observed for SARS-CoV-2 and its recent variants, proinflammatory cytokine production in monocyte-derived macrophages was not upregulated. These observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection produces antibodies that elicit ADE of infection, but these antibodies may not be involved in aberrant cytokine release by macrophages during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory disease, highlights harmful effects of antibodies, body molecules that combat foreign organisms. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is a big concern because of the antibody reaction to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, upon reinfection and the reaction to COVID-19 vaccines. We found that certain cell molecules affect mild ADE of infection against SARS-CoV-2. Although certain immune cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and its variants had infection enhancement, proinflammatory molecules were not increased in these cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection thus creates antibodies that cause ADE of infection, but these antibodies do not lead to increased inflammatory molecule production by certain cells. Viruses infect cells via certain cell parts. ADE of infection or improvement of infection is another method of infection for viruses to infect immune cells influenced by antibodies and certain cellular molecules. Because ADE of infection leads to disease symptoms of some viruses, understanding how ADE works and leads to these symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 is important. Using blood from COVID-19 patients, we found two cellular molecules that influence ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection. While ADE of infection was seen for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, proinflammatory molecule production in certain immune cells was not increased. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection may create antibodies that cause ADE of infection, but these antibodies may not lead to increased inflammatory production by certain cells during infection.","The pandemic of COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) has raised concerns about the harmful effects antibodies can have. Antibodies are proteins used by the immune system to identify and neutralize viruses. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a unique occurrence in which virus-specific antibodies actually increase entrance of the virus into the host. ADE is a big concern for both people who are exposed to COVID-19 and those who receive the vaccine. In this study, the authors evaluated ADE of infection by using COVID-19 convalescent-phase plasma (a specific of plasma often used to treat infections) and human cells expressing Fcγ receptors (FcγRs), special receptors on infection-fighting cells. The authors found two Fcγ receptors mediated or controlled most ADE of infection against COVID-19. Although ADE of infection was found in macrophages (a white blood cell) infected with COVID-19, and its variants, proteins that increase inflammation were not upregulated or increased. COVID-19 creates antibodies that cause ADE of infection. However, these antibodies do not increase inflammatory or infection-fighting responses by macrophages. Viruses infect cells mainly through specific receptors (pathways) on the cell surface. ADE of infection is an alternative way that viruses can infect immune cells. ADE is mediated by antibodies and FcγRs. Because ADE of infection contributes to the development of some viruses, it is import to better understand the exact way ADE contributes to COVID-19 progression. In this study, using plasma or blood from COVID-19 patients, we found that two types of Fcγ receptors mediate ADE of COVID-19 infection. Although ADE of infection was seen for COVID-19, and its variants, increased inflammatory responses in macrophages was not found. These findings suggest that COVID-19 infection produces antibodies that produce ADE of infection. However, these antibodies may not be involved in pro-inflammatory pathways by macrophages."
34,33993809,"Introduction: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) represents a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vitamin D system is altered since early CKD, and vitamin D deficiency is an established trigger of SHPT. Although untreated SHPT may degenerate into tertiary hyperparathyroidism with detrimental consequences in advanced CKD, best treatments for counteracting SHPT from stage 3 CKD are still debated. Enthusiasm on prescription of vitamin D receptor activators (VDRA) in non-dialysis renal patients, has been mitigated by the risk of low bone turnover and positive calcium-phosphate balance. Nutritional vitamin D is now suggested as first-line therapy to treat SHPT with low 25(OH)D insufficiency. However, no high-grade evidence supports the best choice between ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, and calcifediol (in its immediate or extended-release formulation). Areas covered: The review discusses available data on safety and efficacy of nutritional vitamin D, VDRA and nutritional therapy in replenishing 25(OH)D deficiency and counteracting SHPT in non-dialysis CKD patients. Expert opinion: Best treatment for low 25(OH)D and SHPT remains unknown, due to incomplete understanding of the best homeostatic, as mutable, adaptation of mineral metabolism to CKD progression. Nutritional vitamin D and nutritional therapy appear safest interventions, whenever contextualized with single-patient characteristics. VDRA should be restricted to uncontrolled SHPT by first-line therapy.","A disease of the parathyroid (calcium-regulating) glands in the neck that is caused by another disease is called secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), with symptoms that include weak bones, kidney stones, and tiredness. SHPT represents a complication or bad effect of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The vitamin D system is altered early in CKD, and not enough vitamin D is an established trigger of SHPT. Untreated SHPT may become tertiary hyperparathyroidism (when too much of the parathyroid hormone is produced even when the original problem is corrected) with harmful consequences in advanced chronic kidney disease. However, the best treatments for acting against SHPT from stage 3 chronic kidney disease are still debated. Enthusiasm on prescription of vitamin D treatments in non-dialysis kidney patients is lessened by the risk of low bone turnover (when the bone tissue is reabsorbed and replaced by a new bone), and positive calcium-phosphate balance that makes sure systems in the body work well. Nutritional vitamin D is now suggested as first-line therapy to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism with low vitamin D blood test scores. However, no high-grade evidence supports the best choice between which vitamin D product to prescribe. Other areas covered in this review are the data available on safety and effectiveness (success) of vitamin D, vitamin D prescriptions, and nutritional therapy in restoring vitamin D to normal levels (via diet) and acting against secondary hyperparathyroidism. The expert opinion is that the best treatment for low vitamin D levels and secondary hyperparathyroidism remains unknown due to some missing key information. Nutritional vitamin D and nutritional therapy appear to be the safest interventions (treatments), when considering the individual characteristics of each patient. Prescriptions for vitamin D should be limited to only uncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism by first treatment recommended.","Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), which is when the parathyroid glands become hyperactive due to a disease outside the glands, can be an effect of long-lasting or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vitamin D metabolism is altered since early CKD. Vitamin D loss is a known trigger of SHPT. While untreated SHPT may worsen to uncontrolled, excess parathyroid hormone production with harmful effects in advanced CKD, best treatments for preventing this worsening are unknown. The idea of using vitamin D target site or receptor activators (VDRA) in working kidney patients, has been weakened by the risk of bone breakdown and calcium-phosphate imbalance. Nutritional vitamin D is now suggested as first-choice therapy for SHPT and low active vitamin D levels. Still, no high-quality evidence supports the best choice among different vitamin D medications. The review explores available data on the safety and success of nutritional vitamin D, VDRA, and nutritional therapy in replenishing active vitamin D shortage and treating SHPT in working kidney CKD patients. Best treatment for low active vitamin D and SHPT is unknown, due to a partial grasp of the best self-regulating mechanism of mineral metabolism to CKD progression. Nutritional vitamin D and therapy appear safest treatments, when considering single-patient characteristics. VDRA should be limited to uncontrolled SHPT by first-choice therapy."
16,11753760,"The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of corticosteroids on Th1 and Th2 serum cytokine balance in patients with GO: IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-4 and IL-10. Further, we tested the hypothesis of an up-regulation of Th2 immune response during successful treatment with corticosteroids to explain their beneficial effect in Graves' ophthalmopathy. Serum cytokines were detected in three groups of subjects: 20 patients with Graves' disease without ophthalmopathy (Gd), 16 patients with clinical symptoms of ophthalmopathy (GO) (CAS over 3 points, last consultation record for GO less than a year old) and 16 healthy volunteers. Corticosteroid therapy consisted of intravenous infusions of methylprednisolone (MP) (2 series, 3 g each time) and subsequent treatment with oral prednisone (60 mg per day) in a tapering schedule. The serum samples were collected 24 hours before MP, 24 hours after MP, 14 days of treatment with prednisone and at the end of corticosteroid therapy. The levels of IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-4 and IL-10 in the serum were determined using ELISA. Statistical significance was estimated by the Mann-Whitney U-test. Our findings show a deviation to systemic Th2 profile cytokines in Graves' disease. In patients with GO, we found a significantly increased serum IL-10 concentration. In corticosteroid-responsive patients, the balance of serum cytokines IL-4/IFNgamma, IL-4/TNFalpha, IL-10/IFNgamma and IL-10/TN Falpha increased and remained upregulated until the end of the study. In non-responders, the balance of serum cytokines studied increased after methylprednisolone but declined markedly during continuation of the therapy with prednisone. In summary, our results show that efficient corticosteroid therapy may be related to its influence on Th2/Th1 profile cytokine balance. The upregulation of serum IL-4 and IL-10 during successful treatment with corticosteroids indicate the possibility of using these cytokines as predictors of the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in Graves' ophthalmopathy.","The aim of this study is to estimate the effect of corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory drugs that help relieve pain and swelling, also known as steroids) on blood level balance of Th1-related (cells that activate cellular immune responses) and Th2-related (cells that activate hormonal immune responses) cytokines (chemical messengers that coordinate the immune response) in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (swelling of the tissue in the area around the eyes). Further, researchers tested the theory of an up-regulation of the Th2 immune response (where Th2 cells increase their responses to a signal from outside the cell to carry out specific functions) during successful treatment with corticosteroids. Chemical messengers in the blood called cytokines are detected in 3 groups of study participants: 20 patients with Graves' disease without ophthalmology, 16 patients with clinical symptoms of Graves' ophthalmology, and 16 healthy volunteers. Corticosteroid therapy consisted of intravenous (IV) infusions (medication delivered through the vein) of methylprednisolone (a steroid drug) and followed by treatment with oral or by-mouth prednisone (a steroid drug) in a gradually decreasing schedule. Blood samples are collected before and after methylprednisolone, 14 days of treatment with prednisone (a type of steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling), and at the end of the corticosteroid therapy.  The findings show a shift in the response of Th2 cytokines in Graves' disease. In patients with Graves' ophthalmology, there is a significantly increased blood concentration of Interleukin 10 or IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine which helps minimize damage to the body caused by the immune's response. In patients that received corticosteroids and had a response from the drug, the balance of certain blood cytokines that were measured had increased and remained increased until the end of the study. In those patients who did not respond to the corticosteroids, the balance of the specific blood cytokines studied had increased after receiving methylprednisolone but declined a great deal as the therapy continued with prednisone. In summary, results show that effective corticosteroid therapy may be related to its influence on Th2/Th1 cytokine profile balance. The upregulation or increase of blood IL-4 and IL-10 during successful treatment with corticosteroids suggests the possibility of using these cytokines to help predict the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in Graves' ophthalmopathy.",
33,8784216,"The amino acid antiepileptic drug (AED) gabapentin (GBP) is indicated for adjunctive use in the treatment of partial seizures with or without becoming secondarily generalized in individuals older than 12 years. GBP was about as potent as phenytoin in the maximal electroshock test, but had a different profile of efficacy than standard antiepileptics in a range of animal models. Possible mechanisms of action include biochemical effects enhancing the ratio of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to glutamate, ion-channel actions (direct or indirect), and/ or enhancement of nonsynaptic GABA release. The anticonvulsant effect appears to depend on concentration of gabapentin in neurons, presumably by the L-system amino acid transporter that has been implicated in absorption from the gut. Data from studies for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval suggested a direct relationship of clinical response to dose and efficacy did not plateau at the doses used. The maximally effective dose, relationship of efficacy to blood level, and maximum tolerable dose are not yet known conclusively. Lack of significant binding to plasma proteins and lack of liver metabolism contribute to the absence of known limiting drug-drug interactions, particularly with other AEDs. Excretion intact in the urine affords dose adjustment on the basis of creatinine clearance. A half-life of approximately 7 h necessitates multiple doses daily for many individuals. The medication is well tolerated, in general. Side effects tend to be mild to moderate in intensity, most frequently affect the central nervous system, and resolve with time in many individuals. GBP has been prescribed for approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide without untoward incidence of severe systemic toxicity to date. Safety data continue to accumulate. GBP has been labeled category C on the basis of effects on rodent fetuses. Experience with use in pregnant women is limited and human teratogenic effects have not been reported. Data from ongoing monotherapy trials will help to clarify the range of clinical utility of gabapentin.","The drug gabapentin (GBP) is an addition to the regular treatment of partial seizures with or without becoming generalized seizures in the entire brain in people older than 12 years. Gabapentin has performed differently than other standard drugs that are used to prevent seizures in a number of animal experiments. Possible processes that lead the drug to have an effect include the response of increasing the development of neurotransmitters (signaling molecules in the brain) and other cell functions. The act of stopping or slowing the excessive rapid firing of neurons (brain cells) during seizures seems to depend on the concentration of gabapentin in neurons. Data from studies for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval suggest a direct relationship of medical response to the dose and success did not level-off at the doses used. The maximally effective dose (the dose at which any higher dose would not lead to improvement), the relationship of its performance to blood level, and the maximum tolerable dose (the highest dose most people can handle) are not completely known. Lack of attachment to plasma (or blood) proteins and lack of liver energy contribute to the absence of known interactions between drugs, particularly with other drugs that are used to prevent seizures. Doses can be adjusted based on the amount of the drug found in the urine. The time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma or in the body to be reduced by half is about 7 hours, requiring multiple doses daily for many people. In general, people are able to handle the medication and its side effects. Side effects tend to be mild to moderate in intensity, most frequently affect the central nervous system (spinal cord and brain), and resolve with time in many individuals. Gabapentin (GBP) is prescribed for about 70,000 people around the world without unexpected incidence of severe toxic effects so far. Safety data continues to be collected. Gabapentin has shown to have adverse effects on rodent fetuses. Experience with use in pregnant women is limited, and adverse (or bad) effects or abnormalities in human fetuses have not been reported. Data from ongoing single drug trials will help to clarify the range of the clinical use of gabapentin.",
30,33224987,"Knowledge of the sensitivities of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody tests beyond 35 days after the clinical onset of COVID-19 is insufficient. We aimed to describe positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 assays employing three different measurement principles over a prolonged period. Two hundred sixty-eight samples from 180 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test followed by serological investigation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were included. We conducted three chemiluminescence (including electrochemiluminescence assay (ECLIA)), four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and one lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test formats. Positivity rates, as well as positive (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs), were calculated for each week after the first clinical presentation for COVID-19. Furthermore, combinations of tests were assessed within an orthogonal testing approach employing two independent assays and predictive values were calculated. Heat maps were constructed to graphically illustrate operational test characteristics. During a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, chemiluminescence assays and one ELISA IgG test showed stable positivity rates after the third week. With the exception of ECLIA, the PPVs of the other chemiluminescence assays were ≥95% for COVID-19 only after the second week. ELISA and LFIA had somewhat lower PPVs. IgM exhibited insufficient predictive characteristics. An orthogonal testing approach provided PPVs ≥ 95% for patients with a moderate pretest probability (e.g., symptomatic patients), even for tests with a low single test performance. After the second week, NPVs of all but IgM assays were ≥95% for patients with low to moderate pretest probability. The confirmation of negative results using an orthogonal algorithm with another assay provided lower NPVs than the single assays. When interpreting results from SARS-CoV-2 tests, the pretest probability, time of blood draw, and assay characteristics must be carefully considered. An orthogonal testing approach increases the accuracy of positive, but not negative, predictions.","There is not enough information on how well tests for coronavirus (which causes Covid-19 - a breathing-related illness) can correctly diagnose a positive case (which signals presence of the virus) beyond 35 days after the start of Covid-19. This study aims to describe the percentage of positive coronavirus tests out of all tests, also called positivity rate, using three different measurements over a long period of time. Researchers took 268 samples from 180 Covid-19 patients with symptoms. These samples are tested using an RT-PCR test that finds traces of genetic material of the virus and a blood test to look for antibodies (proteins used by the immune system to fight infection). Researchers used 3 electrochemiluminescence assay (ECLIA) test formats that can look for multiple types of antibodies in the blood, 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests that test for antibodies for the coronavirus and can provide information about past exposure to Covid-19, and 1 lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test format that can detect active coronavirus. After the first clinical sign for Covid-19 starts, the positivity rate and other measures to find the percentage of positive and negative (no virus) results in tests that are true positive, called positive predictive value, and true negative results, called negative predictive value, are calculated each week. Combinations of tests are measured to better understand how the primary tests are working. Maps are created to show how the different tests operate. During a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, a type of ECLIA and one ELISA antibody test showed stable positivity rates after the third week. Except for ECLIA, the positive predictive value (percentage of positive tests that are true positives) of the other tests similar to ECLIA are ≥95% for Covid-19 only after the second week. ELISA and LFIA have somewhat lower positive predictive values. The IgM antibody that suggests a recent infection did not have enough information to do predictive calculations. An orthogonal testing approach is when a person who tests positive are tested again with a second test. Orthogonal testing provided a positive predictive value of ≥ 95% for patients who probably had the disease (e.g., symptomatic patients). After the second week, negative predictive values (percentage of negative test results that are true negatives) of all but the IgM antibody test are ≥95% for patients with a low or moderate chance of likely having the disease before being tested. When reading results from coronavirus tests, the estimate of the chance of having the disease before confirming with a test, the time that blood is drawn, and test characteristics must be considered. An orthogonal testing approach when a person with a positive results receives a second test increases the accuracy of positive, but not negative, predictions.",
49,23939641,"Edema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space that occurs as the capillary filtration exceeds the limits of lymphatic drainage, producing noticeable clinical signs and symptoms. The rapid development of generalized pitting edema associated with systemic disease requires timely diagnosis and management. The chronic accumulation of edema in one or both lower extremities often indicates venous insufficiency, especially in the presence of dependent edema and hemosiderin deposition. Skin care is crucial in preventing skin breakdown and venous ulcers. Eczematous (stasis) dermatitis can be managed with emollients and topical steroid creams. Patients who have had deep venous thrombosis should wear compression stockings to prevent postthrombotic syndrome. If clinical suspicion for deep venous thrombosis remains high after negative results are noted on duplex ultrasonography, further investigation may include magnetic resonance venography to rule out pelvic or thigh proximal venous thrombosis or compression. Obstructive sleep apnea may cause bilateral leg edema even in the absence of pulmonary hypertension. Brawny, nonpitting skin with edema characterizes lymphedema, which can present in one or both lower extremities. Possible secondary causes of lymphedema include tumor, trauma, previous pelvic surgery, inguinal lymphadenectomy, and previous radiation therapy. Use of pneumatic compression devices or compression stockings may be helpful in these cases.","Edema is a build up of fluid in the body's tissues and does not drain properly, producing noticeable clinical signs and symptoms. The rapid development of pitting edema, which is when pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation, associated with diseases that affects other parts of the body requires timely diagnosis and management. The ongoing build up of edema in one or both lower legs often suggests veins in the lower limbs are not allowing enough blood to flow to the heart, especially in the presence of gravity-related swelling and build up of iron deposits under the skin that has a shade of brown pigment. Skin care is crucial in preventing skin breakdown and venous ulcers, open sores on the skin from abnormal vein function. Inflamed skin in the lower legs called eczematous (stasis) dermatitis is a kind of eczema (skin swelling) caused by poor circulation and can be helped with moisturizers and topical steroid creams. Patients who have had a condition where a blood clot forms in the vein called deep venous thrombosis should wear compression stockings. If a doctor believes a diagnosis for deep venous thrombosis is possible even after negative (no detection) results are noted on tests, further investigation may include imaging scans to rule out pelvic or thigh proximal venous thrombosis or compression. Occasional airflow blockage during sleep called obstructive sleep apnea may cause edema in both legs even in the absence of high blood pressure. Discolored, non-pitting (non-indentable) skin with edema is often a sign of lymphedema, fluid build-up in soft tissues when the lymph system is damaged or blocked, which can present in one or both lower limbs. Possible other causes of lymphedema include tumor, trauma, previous pelvic surgery, inguinal lymphadenectomy (lymph node dissection), and previous radiation therapy. Use of compression devices that are inflatable sleeves worn on the legs or compression stockings may be helpful in these cases.","Edema is a buildup of fluid in the body that occurs as the filtration rate exceeds the drainage rate, producing noticeable symptoms. The rapid development of swelling linked with full-body disease needs timely identification and treatment. The long-lasting buildup of fluid in one or both legs often indicates blood vessel impairment, especially in the presence of swelling in the limbs and iron buildup. Skin care is needed in preventing skin breakdown and vein-related open sores. Skin inflammation from swelling in the legs can be managed with specific moisturizers and steroid creams. Patients who have had deep venous thrombosis (deep vein blood clotting) should wear compression socks to prevent its symptoms like pain and swelling. If clinicians remain suspicious of deep venous thrombosis even when lab tests do not detect it, further lab tests may be performed to rule out other forms of blood clotting and compression. Obstructuve sleep apnea (disorder in which breathing is consistently interrupted during sleep by a blockage) may cause swelling in both legs even without lung-related high blood pressure. Sturdy skin with swelling characterizes lymphedema (fluid buildup when the body's drainage system is blocked), which can present in one or both legs. Possible secondary causes of lymphedema include tumor, blunt force, previous hip surgery, lymph node (immune system organ) removal, and previous radiation therapy. Use of compression devices to prevent blood clotting or socks may be helpful in these cases."
38,19035067,"A pressure ulcer is a localized injury to the skin or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of unrelieved pressure. Predisposing factors are classified as intrinsic (e.g., limited mobility, poor nutrition, comorbidities, aging skin) or extrinsic (e.g., pressure, friction, shear, moisture). Prevention includes identifying at-risk persons and implementing specific prevention measures, such as following a patient repositioning schedule; keeping the head of the bed at the lowest safe elevation to prevent shear; using pressure-reducing surfaces; and assessing nutrition and providing supplementation, if needed. When an ulcer occurs, documentation of each ulcer (i.e., size, location, eschar and granulation tissue, exudate, odor, sinus tracts, undermining, and infection) and appropriate staging (I through IV) are essential to the wound assessment. Treatment involves management of local and distant infections, removal of necrotic tissue, maintenance of a moist environment for wound healing, and possibly surgery. Debridement is indicated when necrotic tissue is present. Urgent sharp debridement should be performed if advancing cellulitis or sepsis occurs. Mechanical, enzymatic, and autolytic debridement methods are nonurgent treatments. Wound cleansing, preferably with normal saline and appropriate dressings, is a mainstay of treatment for clean ulcers and after debridement. Bacterial load can be managed with cleansing. Topical antibiotics should be considered if there is no improvement in healing after 14 days. Systemic antibiotics are used in patients with advancing cellulitis, osteomyelitis, or systemic infection.","A pressure ulcer is an injury to the skin or underlying tissue, usually over a bony portion of the body, caused by unrelieved pressure. Factors that make someone more likely to have a pressure ulcer are classified as intrinsic (internal factors) or extrinsic (external factors). Intrinsic factors include limited mobility, poor nutrition, comorbidities, or aging skin. Extrinsic factors include pressure, friction, shear (vertical force), or moisture. There are several preventative protocols for pressure ulcers that can be used. These protocols include identifying at-risk persons and implementing specific prevention measures. Preventative measures include repositioning patients on a schedule, keeping hospital beds at a low and safe elevation to prevent shear, using pressure-reducing surfaces, and assessing (measuring) nutrition and providing supplementation. When an ulcer occurs, wound assessment is needed. When assessing each ulcer, there are several factors that need to be identified. These include ulcer size, location, dead or irregular tissue, discharge, odor, sinus tracts (channels in the skin), wound edge erosion or edge removal, infection, and appropriate staging (I through IV). Treatment involves managing local and spreading infections, removal of dead tissue, maintenance of a moist environment for wound healing, and possibly surgery. Debridement, or removal of damaged tissue from a wound, is indicated when necrotic or dead tissue is present. Urgent sharp debridement should be performed if advancing skin or bleed infection occurs. Mechanical (surgery), enzymatic (chemical agents), and autolytic debridement (body's natural defense system) methods are nonurgent treatments. Wound cleansing, preferably with normal saline (salt water) and appropriate dressings, is common for treatment for clean ulcers and after removal of damaged skin. Bacterial load, or the amount of bacteria within the body, can be managed with cleansing. Topical antibiotics are bacterial-fighting medicines applied to the skin. They should be considered if there is no improvement in healing after 14 days. Systemic antibiotics are medicines normally taken in pill form that effects the whole body. These are used in patients with advancing deep skin infection, bone infection, or whole body infection.","A pressure ulcer (bedsore) is a area-limited injury to the skin and neaby body parts, usually over a bone, due to unrelieved pressure. Risk factors can be intrinsic (e.g., limited movement, poor diet, other diseases, aging skin) or extrinsic (e.g, pressure, friction, strain, moisure). Prevention includes identifying at-risk people and applying preventative measures, like regularly moving the patient's position, keeping the bed head low to prevent strain, using pressure-reducing surfaces, evaluating diet and giving diet supplemets, if needed. When an ulcer occurs, examining it (i.e., size, location, type of affected tissue, leaking fluid, odor, wound openings, wear and tea, and infection) and the severity of the ulcer are essential to wound assessment. Treatment includes managing nearby and far-away infetions, removing dead body tissue, maintaining a moist environment for wound healing, and even surgery. Removing damaged body tissue (debridement) is needed when dead tissue is present. Urgent debridement should be done if bacterial skin infections develop. Physical removal, use of a chemical topical, and natural forms of debridement are nonurgent treatments. Wound cleaning, preferably with salt water and appropriate bandages, are common treatment for clean bedsores and after removing damaged body tissue. Bacteria can be managed with cleaning. Antibiotics applied skin-level should be considered if there is no healing after 14 days. Full-body antibiotics are used in those with developing skin infections, inflammation, or full-body infection."
9,32686966,"Objective: This study was designed to explore the clinical application of video laryngoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of throat foreign bodies (FBs). Method: In total, 1572 patients diagnosed with throat FBs at the Department of Otolaryngology of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital were retrospectively analysed. The covariables collected were the time from FB ingestion to admission, age, sex, duration of admission, and site of impaction. Result: The most common FBs were fish bones, which accounted for 1446 (91.98%) of 1572 FBs. Among all 1572 FBs, 1004 (63.87%) were successfully removed by video laryngoscopy without complications. A shorter duration of admission was associated with a higher diagnostic rate under video laryngoscopy. The diagnostic rate of sharp FBs was significantly higher than that of non-sharp FBs. The most common sites of throat FBs were the tongue root (42.29%), epiglottic vallecula (19.40%), tonsil (18.21%), and piriform fossa (10.65%). Conclusion: Video laryngoscopy is a powerful tool for the diagnosis and treatment of throat FBs, allowing for identification of rare locations of FBs as well as refractory FBs.","This work explored the use of video viewing of the voice box with a small device to identify and treat throat foreign bodies (FBs) or substances. 1572 total patients with throat foreign substances at the Department of Otolarynology of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital were analysed. Time from foreign substance consumption to hospital admission, age, sex, duration of admission, and site of blockage were measured. The most common foreign substance was fish bones, seen in 91.98% of patients. Among all 1572 foreign substances, 1004 (63.87%) were removed by video throat treatment with a small device without issues. A shorter hospital stay was linked to higher identification rate by video viewing of the voice box with a small device. The identification rate of sharp foreign substances was higher than that of non-sharp ones. The most common sites of throat foreign substances were areas near the tonsil and bottom of the tongue and throat. Video viewing of the voice box with a small device is powerful for identifying and treating throat foreign substances. It allows identification of rare locations of foreign substances and stubborn ones.","The study aimed to look at the use of a camera on the tip of a curved blade to diagnose and remove objects in the throat that shouldn’t be eaten. We studied 1572 people who had objects in the throat that shouldn't be eaten. We wrote down the time between eating the object and coming to the hospital, age, gender, how long the patient was in the hospital, and where the object was stuck. The most common objects stuck were fish bones, which made up 1446 (91.98%) of 1572 objects. Among all 1572 objects, 1004 (63.87%) were successfully removed using a camera on the tip of a curved blade without problems. When a camera on the tip of a curved blade was used to diagnose the object, people left the hospital sooner. Diagnosing sharp objects was higher than that of non-sharp objects. The most common place that objects were stuck in the throat were the far back and bottom of the tongue (42.29%), the space between the back of the tongue and the windpipe entrance (19.40%), the tonsil (18.21%), and the bottom of the throat (10.65%). We conclude that using a camera on the tip of a curved blade is a strong tool for the diagnosis and removal of objects in the throat that shouldn't be eaten, allowing for the finding of uncommon locations of objects and of objects not easily removed."
25,34537363,"Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the impact of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) treatment and to determine whether the mAbs selective pressure could facilitate the proliferation of virus variants with spike protein mutations that might attenuate mAb effectiveness. Patients and methods: We therefore evaluated the impact of mAbs on the nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load and virus quasispecies of mAb-treated patients using single molecule real time sequencing (Pacific Biosciences). The mAbs used were: Bamlanivimab alone (4 patients), Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (23 patients), and Casirivimab/Imdevimab (5 patients). Results: The NP SARS-CoV-2 viral load of mAb-treated patients decreased from 8.2 log10 copies/ml before administration to 4.3 log10 copies/ml 7 days after administration. Five immunocompromised patients given Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab were found to have mAbs activity-reducing spike mutations. Two patients harbored SARS-CoV-2 variants with a Q493R spike mutation 7 days after administration, as did a third patient 14 days after administration. The fourth patient harbored a variant with a Q493K spike mutation 7 days post-treatment, and the fifth patient had a variant with a E484K spike mutation on day 21. The emergence of the spike mutation was accompanied by stabilization or rebound of the NP viral load in 3/5 patients. Conclusion: Two-m Ab therapy can drive the selection of resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants in immunocompromised patients. Patients given mAbs should be closely monitored and measures to limit virus spread reinforced.","We aimed to test the effect of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibodies that bind to only one site of a foreign organism. We determine if mAbs may help grow mutated virus variants that may weaken mAb effectiveness. We test the effect of mAbs on the virus species and amount in the upper throat of mAb-treated patients. The mAbs used were: Bamlanivimab alone (4 patients), Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (23 patients), and Casirivimab/Imdevimab (5 patients). The amount of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which cause a respiratory illness, in the upper throats of mAb-treated patients decreased 7 days after treatment. Five patients with an impaired immune system and given Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab had mutations that reduced the effect of mAbs. Two patients with SARS-CoV-2 variants had a mutations 7 days after treatment, along with a third patient 14 days after treatment. The fourth patient had a variant with a mutation 7 days after treatment, along with a fifth patient on day 21. The onset of the mutation came with a rebound or stabilization of virus amount in 3/5 patients. Two-mAb treatment can lead to resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants in patients with an impaired immune system. Patients given mAbs should be monitored and measures to limit virus spread reinforced.","This study aims to evaluate the impact of monoclonal antibodies, medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 (a viral lung infection) from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. The study also aims to determine if certain monoclonal antibodies can lead to spread of virus variants through mutations that may reduce the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies. Researchers evaluate the impact of monoclonal antibodies on the viral load (quantity of the virus) found in the nose and the number of mutations in patients treated with monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies used are bamlanivimab alone (in 4 patients), Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (in 23 patients), and Casirivimab/Imdevimab (in5 patients). The viral load in the nose of monoclonal antibodies-treated patients decreased 7 days after the medicines were given. Five patients with a weak immune system who were given Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab are found to have reduced mutations that allow the virus to enter cells and cause infection. Two patients with coronavirus variants have a mutation that enabled the virus to enter cells 7 days after the medicines are given. The same occurred with a third patient 14 days after the medicines are given. The fourth patient with a variant has a mutation 7 days after the medicine is stopped, and the fifth patient has a variant with a mutation on day 21. The start of the mutation is connected with a stable or increased viral load in the nose in 3 out of 5 patients. In conclusion, two monoclonal antibody drugs can drive the targeting of coronavirus variants in patients with weak immune systems. Patients given monoclonal antibody should be closely monitored, and measures to limit virus spread should be strengthened."
20,19445546,"Pediatric generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about a variety of events and is accompanied by physical symptoms such as headaches, tension, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, and heart palpitations. Symptoms impose marked distress and interfere with social, emotional, and educational functioning. GAD occurs in over 10% of children and adolescents, has an average age of onset of 8.5 years, and is more often reported in girls. Common co-occurring conditions include separation anxiety disorder and social phobia. Assessment involves a multi-informant, multi-method approach involving the child, parents, and school teachers. A clinical interview should be conducted to assess for the three primary ways anxiety presents: behaviors, thoughts, and somatic symptoms. Several semi-structured diagnostic interviews are available, and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule is increasingly used. Rating scales completed by the patient, caregivers, and teachers provide useful information for diagnosis and symptom monitoring. Several scales are available to assess patients for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition) GAD diagnosis; however, instruments generally cannot distinguish children with GAD from children with similar anxiety disorders. Both cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders including GAD. Evidence suggests that the combination of CBT plus sertraline offers additional benefit compared with either treatment alone. With pharmacotherapy, systematic tracking of treatment-emergent adverse events such as headaches, stomach aches, behavioral activation, worsening symptoms, and emerging suicidal thoughts is important. Recommended starting doses are fluvoxamine 25 mg/day, fluoxetine 10 mg/day, and sertraline 25 mg/day, though lower starting doses are possible. Dosing can be adjusted as often as weekly with the goal of achieving a high-quality response, while minimizing side effects. Long-term treatment with medication has not been well studied; however, to achieve optimal long-term outcome extended use of medication may be required. It is recommended to continue medication for approximately 1 year following remission in symptoms, and when discontinuing medication to choose a stress-free time of the year. If symptoms return, medication re-initiation should be considered seriously.","In children, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) includes having more than normal and uncontrollable worry about different events and is also includes physical symptoms such as headaches, tension, restlessness, digestive problems, and a racing heartbeat.

GAD is more often reported in girls. Common conditions that occur with GAD include getting very anxious when separated from family or the main caregiver and social phobia, an intense fear of being in front of others or being watched or judged. Multiple methods are used to test for GAD and includes the child, parents, and school teachers. An interview is recommended to look for the three main ways anxiety is shown: behaviors, thoughts, and somatic (physical) symptoms. Several interview formats to make a diagnosis are available. The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule is increasingly used. Ratings scales are completed by the patient, caregivers, and teachers and provide useful information for diagnosis and symptom monitoring. Several scales are able to make a GAD diagnosis which is a diagnosis based on the well-known handbook of mental disorders used by many providers; however, interview tools usually cannot make the distinction between children with GAD and children with similar anxiety disorders.

55,34540633,"This is a comprehensive literature review of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). We provide a description of the background, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management regarding CFS. CFS is a multifaceted illness that has many symptoms and a wide array of clinical presentations. As of recent, CFS has been merged with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Much of the difficulty in its management has stemmed from a lack of a concrete understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis. There is a potential association between dysfunction of the autoimmune, neuroendocrine, or autonomic nervous systems and the development of CFS. Possible triggering events, such as infections followed by an immune dysregulation resulting have also been proposed. In fact, ME/CFS was first described following Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infections, but it was later determined that it was not always preceded by EBV infection. Patient diagnosed with CFS have shown a noticeably earlier activation of anaerobic metabolism as a source of energy, which is suggestive of impaired oxygen consumption. The differential diagnoses range from tick-borne illnesses to psychiatric disorders to thyroid gland dysfunction. Given the many overlapping symptoms of CFS with other illnesses makes diagnosing it far from an easy task. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers it a diagnosing of exclusion, stating that self-reported fatigue for at minimum of six months and four of the following symptoms are necessary for a proper diagnosis: memory problems, sore throat, post-exertion malaise, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, myalgia, multi-joint pain, headaches, and troubled sleep. In turn, management of CFS is just as difficult. Treatment ranges from conservative, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressants, to minimally invasive management. Minimally invasive management involving ranscutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation of target points has demonstrated significant improvement in fatigue and associated symptoms in a 2017 randomized controlled study. The understanding of CFS is evolving before us as we continue to learn more about it. As further reliable studies are conducted, providing a better grasp of what the syndrome encompasses, we will be able to improve our diagnosis and management of it.","This study is a literature review of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS - long-lasting tiredness).

46,32637102,"Cystic fibrosis patients display multi-organ system dysfunction (e.g. pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and lung) with pathogenesis linked to a failure of Cl- secretion from the epithelial surfaces of these organs. If unmanaged, organ dysfunction starts early and patients experience chronic respiratory infection with reduced lung function and a failure to thrive due to gastrointestinal malabsorption. Early mortality is typically caused by respiratory failure. In the past 40 years of newborn screening and improved disease management have driven the median survival up from the mid-teens to 43-53, with most of that improvement coming from earlier and more aggressive management of the symptoms. In the last decade, promising pharmacotherapies have been developed for the correction of the underlying epithelial dysfunction, namely, Cl- secretion. A new generation of systemic drugs target the mutated Cl- channels in cystic fibrosis patients and allow trafficking of the immature mutated protein to the cell membrane (correctors), restore function to the channel once in situ (potentiators), or increase protein levels in the cells (amplifiers). Restoration of channel function prior to symptom development has the potential to significantly change the trajectory of disease progression and their evidence suggests that a modest restoration of Cl- secretion may delay disease progression by decades. In this article, we review epithelial vectorial ion and fluid transport, its quantification and measurement as a marker for cystic fibrosis ion transport dysfunction, and highlight some of the recent therapies targeted at the dysfunctional ion transport of cystic fibrosis.","People with cystic fibrosis have organs that do not function correctly (e.g., pancreas, digestive system, and lung) linked to not enough CI- (chloride) production and release from epithelial cells (cells that cover outer surface of the internal organs). If not treated, organs quickly stop working and patients have long-term respiratory infection with decreased lung function and a decline in health from poor absorption of food. Early death usually happens when lungs can't get enough oxygen into the blood. The past 40 years of newborn checks and better ways to treat disease have increased the age that half of patients are still alive from the mid-teens to 43-53, with most of the increase due to earlier and more aggressive management of the symptoms. In the last 10 years, drugs have been made to correct underlying problems in epithelial cells, mainly, CI- production and release. New drugs for cystic fibrosis patients that work throughout the body target the changed atom (Cl-; chloride) channels and help the changed protein to move to the cell surface (correctors), hold the gate to the channel open so chloride can flow through the cell membrane (potentiators), or increase protein levels in the cells (amplifiers). Restoring channel function before symptoms develop could change the course of the disease and a small repair of Cl- production and release may delay disease worsening by decades. We look at movement of ions (charged atoms) and fluids in epithelial cells, how to count and measure this movement as a sign of cystic fibrosis transport problems, and discuss recent treatments for cystic fibrosis transport problems.",
14,32935536,"The coronavirus are a wide group of viruses among that the SARS-CoV-2 is included (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Betacoronavirus and subgenus Sarbecovirus). Its main structural proteins are the membrane (M), the envelope (E), the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 involves the cellular and the humoral sides, with neutralizing antibodies fundamentally directed against the S antigen. Although the seroprevalence data are frequently assumed as protection markers, no necessarily they are. In Spain, it is estimated that, to assure the herd immunity, at least four-fifths of the population should be immunoprotected. Due the high fatality rate of COVID-19, the acquisition of the protection only by the natural infection it not assumable and other measures as the mass immunization are required. Currently, there are several vaccine prototypes (including life virus, viral vectors, peptides and proteins and nucleic acid) in different phase of clinical evaluation. Foreseeably, some of these news vaccines would be soon commercially available. In this text, aspects related to these issues are reviewed.","The coronavirus are a wide group of viruses among that the SARS-CoV-2 (the novel breathing-related coronavirus that can lead to COVID-19) is included. Its main structural proteins are the membrane (M) (a thin layer of lipids that protects the cell and acts as a barrier), the envelope (E) (a small membrane protein and is involved in parts of a virus life cycle), the nucleocapsid (N) (an important protein for viral replication and genome packaging) and spike (S) (a protein involved in introducing coronavirus into host cells). The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 involves the cellular (white blood cells that defend the body against infection) and the humoral sides (molecules that create antibodies against a specific antigen and involve substances found in the humors, or body fluids). There are some data of the percentage of people in a population who have antibodies to an infectious virus. These data are sometimes used to find out how well people are protected from a virus. In Spain, it is suggested that to reach herd immunity (a form of indirect protection from an infectious disease that can occur when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection), at least four-fifths of a population (about 80%) should have immunity. Due to the high death rate of COVID-19, being protected by getting the virus is not always reliable, and other measures to reach mass immunization are required. There are different vaccine types currently being evaluated. It is expected that these new vaccines will soon be available to the public.

Historically many pharmacological therapies have been studied in TD, finding varying degrees of treatment success. Most recently, the VMAT2 inhibitors valbenazine and deutetrabenazine were rigorously studied in TD in large, phase III clinical trials, and were shown to be beneficial in this population.

41,34155062,"Background: In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), cyst development and enlargement lead to ESKD. Macrophage recruitment and interstitial inflammation promote cyst growth. TWEAK is a TNF superfamily (TNFSF) cytokine that regulates inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, and cell death, and its receptor Fn14 (TNFRSF12a) is expressed in macrophage and nephron epithelia. Methods: To evaluate the role of the TWEAK signaling pathway in cystic disease, we evaluated Fn14 expression in human and in an orthologous murine model of ADPKD. We also explored the cystic response to TWEAK signaling pathway activation and inhibition by peritoneal injection. Results: Meta-analysis of published animal-model data of cystic disease reveals mRNA upregulation of several components of the TWEAK signaling pathway. We also observed that TWEAK and Fn14 were overexpressed in mouse ADPKD kidney cysts, and TWEAK was significantly high in urine and cystic fluid from patients with ADPKD. TWEAK administration induced cystogenesis and increased cystic growth, worsening the phenotype in a murine ADPKD model. Anti-TWEAK antibodies significantly slowed the progression of ADPKD, preserved renal function, and improved survival. Furthermore, the anti-TWEAK cystogenesis reduction is related to decreased cell proliferation-related MAPK signaling, decreased NF-κB pathway activation, a slight reduction of fibrosis and apoptosis, and an indirect decrease in macrophage recruitment. Conclusions: This study identifies the TWEAK signaling pathway as a new disease mechanism involved in cystogenesis and cystic growth and may lead to a new therapeutic approach in ADPKD.","In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), an inherited disorder that causes cysts (growths) in the kidneys, cyst development and enlargement lead to end-stage kidney disease. The recruitment of macrophage cells (a type of white blood cell that surrounds and kills microorganisms, removes dead cells, and activates other immune system cells) and spaces between the kidney becoming swollen are found to promote cyst growth. TWEAK is a type of cytokine (chemical messenger) that regulates inflammatory (infection-fighting) responses, cell growth and division, and cell death. Its receptor Fn14 (TNFRSF12a) that sends and receives signals is expressed in macrophages and a layer of outer lining cells in the kidney called nephron epithelia. To evaluate how the TWEAK cytokine signaling plays a role in cystic disease, researchers evaluate the Fn14 gene development in humans and in experiments with animals of ADPKD. Researchers also looked at the response from cysts to the activation of TWEAK signaling as well as its limited signaling by injections. Data published from animal studies of cystic disease show increases in mRNA (genetic strands with instructions to build proteins) of several parts of the TWEAK signaling pathway. Researchers also found that too many TWEAK and Fn14 gene-derived molecules are in made in mouse ADPKD kidney cysts, and TWEAK is very high in the urine and cystic fluid from patients with ADPKD. TWEAK use started formation of cysts and increased cystic growth, worsening physical traits in an animal ADPKD model. Anti-TWEAK antibodies (a protein used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as harmful bacteria and viruses) significantly slowed the progression of ADPKD, protected kidney function, and improved survival. Additionally, the reduction of cyst formation is related to decreased cell growth and a decrease in macrophage recruitment. In conclusion, this study identifies the TWEAK signaling pathway as a new disease process involved in the growth and formation of many cysts and may lead to a new treatment approach in ADPKD.",
54,26368010,"The objective was to determine the strength of relationship between maternal free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) concentrations and rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Consecutive records of the database of our Down screening project were assessed for free β-hCG levels and pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancies with foetal chromosomal or structural anomalies and those with underlying disease were excluded. Free β-hCG levels of < 0.5, > 0.5 and < 2.0, and ≥ 2.0 MoM were categorised as low, normal and high, respectively. Of 17,082 screened women, 13,620 were available for analysis. In the first trimester (n = 8150), low β-hCG levels significantly increased risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW) and low Apgar score with relative risk of 1.66, 1.43, 1.83 and 2.89; whereas high β-hCG group had a significant decreased risk of preterm birth and GDM with relative risk of 0.73 and 0.62. In the second trimester (n = 5470), both low and high β-hCG groups had significant increased risks of the most common adverse outcomes, i.e. spontaneous abortion, IUGR and preterm birth. In conclusion, abnormally low (< 0.5MoM) or high (> 2.0 MoM) free β-hCG levels are generally associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

41,33536341,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 genes and affects multiple organs, including kidney, lung, and brain. In the kidney, TSC presents with the enlargement of benign tumors (angiomyolipomata) and cysts, which eventually leads to kidney failure. The factors promoting cyst formation and tumor growth in TSC are incompletely understood. Here, we report that mice with principal cell-specific inactivation of Tsc1 develop numerous cortical cysts, which are overwhelmingly composed of hyperproliferating A-intercalated (A-IC) cells. RNA sequencing and confirmatory expression studies demonstrated robust expression of Forkhead Transcription Factor 1 (Foxi1) and its downstream targets, apical H+-ATPase and cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase 2 (CAII), in cyst epithelia in Tsc1 knockout (KO) mice but not in Pkd1 mutant mice. In addition, the electrogenic 2Cl-/H+ exchanger (CLC-5) is significantly up-regulated and shows remarkable colocalization with H+-ATPase on the apical membrane of cyst epithelia in Tsc1 KO mice. Deletion of Foxi1, which is vital to intercalated cells viability and H+-ATPase expression, completely abrogated the cyst burden in Tsc1 KO mice, as indicated by MRI images and histological analysis in kidneys of Foxi1/Tsc1 double-knockout (dKO) mice. Deletion of CAII, which is critical to H+-ATPase activation, caused significant reduction in cyst burden and increased life expectancy in CAII/Tsc1 dKO mice vs. Tsc1 KO mice. We propose that intercalated cells and their acid/base/electrolyte transport machinery (H+-ATPase/CAII/CLC-5) are critical to cystogenesis, and their inhibition or inactivation is associated with significant protection against cyst generation and/or enlargement in TSC.","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare disease that leads to noncancerous (benign) tumors forming in the body. TSC is caused by changes in two specific genes (TSC1 or TSC2) and affects multiple organs, including the kidney, lung, and brain. In the kidney, TSC can cause benign tumors and cysts (fluid swellings) to grow, which eventually leads to kidney failure. The factors promoting cyst formation and tumor growth in TSC are not completely understood. In this study, researchers report that mice with inactivation (turning off) of specific cells develop many cysts in the kidney. Past studies with mice show an increase of the Forkhead Transcription Factor 1 (Foxi1) gene that impacts cell processing in cyst epithelia cells, which are important cells for kidney function. Also, some gene processing is increased and work together with proton pumps called H+-ATPase, which regulate functions such as nutrient intake and regulating acids between cells, on the lining of epithelial cysts cells in mice. Deletion of the Foxi1 gene, which is key to the survival of cells and H+-ATPase processing, overrides the cyst burden in Tsc1 mice. Deletion of the enzyme CAII causes major decreases in cyst burden and increased life expectancy in mice without CAII and Tsc1 versus mice without just Tsc1. Researchers suggest that epithelial cells in the kidneys and their transport mechanisms are important to the formation of many cysts, and slowing or stopping them is associated with significant protection against cyst development and/or enlargement in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).",

37,33515658,"Pregabalin (PGB) is an analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. The currently available evidence favors the misuse and abuse potential of PGB. However, its neurotoxicity remains unclear. Therefore, this study assessed the toxic effects of chronic pregabalin dependence as well as withdrawal on the cortical neurons of the frontal lobe. This study included eighty adult male albino rats which were divided into three groups. Group I (Control) included 40 rats and was further subdivided into two equal subgroups (IA and IB) as negative and positive controls. Group II (PGB-dependent) included 20 rats which received PGB starting with the therapeutic dose (300 mg/day), then the doses were gradually increased until they reached the dependent dose (3400 mg/day) by the end of the first month. Further, the dependent dose was given daily for another 2 months. Group III (PGB withdrawal) included 20 rats which received PGB as described in group II. After that, administration of PGB was stopped and the rats were kept for another one month. By the end of the experiment, all animals were sacrificed by cervical decapitation. The specimens were taken from the frontal cortex for histologic and immunohistochemical staining as well as morphometric analysis. Sections of the frontal cortex of group II showed changes in the form of disturbed architectural pattern of cortical layers, apoptotic cells, weak immunoexpression of Bcl-2 and VEGF as well as moderate-strong immunoexpression of iNOS and nestin. These expressions were significantly different from the control groups, but they were non-significant in comparison with group III. These findings indicate that chronic PGB dependence induces neurotoxic effects mainly in the form of neuronal apoptosis, gliosis, and oxidative stress injury of the frontal cortex. The PGB- induced neurotoxic effects persisted after withdrawal. The influence of these neurotoxic effects and their relevance to the cognitive or neurologic disorders in PGB-dependent individuals warrants further research.

15,31239388,"Background: The basolateral potassium channel in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), comprising the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1/Kir5.1 heterotetramer, plays a key role in mediating the effect of dietary potassium intake on the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC). The role of Kir5.1 (encoded by Kcnj16) in mediating effects of dietary potassium intake on the NCC and renal potassium excretion is unknown. Methods: We used electrophysiology, renal clearance, and immunoblotting to study Kir4.1 in the DCT and NCC in Kir5.1 knockout (Kcnj16-/- ) and wild-type (Kcnj16+/+ ) mice fed with normal, high, or low potassium diets. Results: We detected a 40-pS and 20-pS potassium channel in the basolateral membrane of the DCT in wild-type and knockout mice, respectively. Compared with wild-type, Kcnj16-/- mice fed a normal potassium diet had higher basolateral potassium conductance, a more negative DCT membrane potential, higher expression of phosphorylated NCC (pNCC) and total NCC (tNCC), and augmented thiazide-induced natriuresis. Neither high- nor low-potassium diets affected the basolateral DCT's potassium conductance and membrane potential in Kcnj16-/- mice. Although high potassium reduced and low potassium increased the expression of pNCC and tNCC in wild-type mice, these effects were absent in Kcnj16-/- mice. High potassium intake inhibited and low intake augmented thiazide-induced natriuresis in wild-type but not in Kcnj16-/- mice. Compared with wild-type, Kcnj16-/- mice with normal potassium intake had slightly lower plasma potassium but were more hyperkalemic with prolonged high potassium intake and more hypokalemic during potassium restriction. Conclusions: Kir5.1 is essential for dietary potassium's effect on NCC and for maintaining potassium homeostasis.","Potassium channels are proteins that allow rapid and careful flow of potassium ions (an atom that carries an electrical charge) across the cell boundary and generates electrical signals in cells. Two potassium channels located in cells of the kidneys called potassium channels Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 play a key role on controlling how potassium from foods affect how salt is reabsorbed. The role of Kir5.1 in how it passes on potassium from foods in the kidneys and how it releases potassium is unknown. Researchers studied Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 in different parts of the kidneys by using two different types of mice (called wild-type mice - or normal mice - and knockout mice - mice without a specific gene like the one encoding Kir5.1) fed with normal, high, or low potassium diets. When compared with the wild-type mice, the knockout mice that were fed a normal potassium diet had higher transmission of potassium, had more negative charges in some cell boundaries or membranes, had higher activation of major salt reabsorption pathways, and had an increase in the release of sodium in the urine. Neither a diet high nor low in potassium affected the potassium channel that is located at the base or sides of the cell or the negative charges in the cell membranes in the knockout mice. Although high potassium reduced activation of major salt reabsorption pathways and low potassium increased activation of major salt reabsorption pathways in wild-type mice, these effects were not found in the knockout mice. High potassium diets slowed or stopped release of sodium in the urine while low potassium diets increased the release of sodium in the urine in wild-type mice but not in knock-out mice. When compared with wild-type mice, knockout mice who had normal potassium level diets had slightly lower plasma potassium (potassium in the blood). However, knockout mice were more hyperkalemic (having a higher than normal level of potassium in the bloodstream) with a long, high potassium diet and hypokalemic (having a lower than normal level of potassium in the blood) with a restricted potassium diet. Kir5.1 is key for the effect of potassium from foods on how salt is reabsorbed and for maintaining a stable balance of potassium.",
44,29262047,"Etiology: Though most commonly thought of in the setting of trauma, there are numerous causes of hemorrhagic shock that span many systems. Blunt or penetrating trauma is the most common cause, followed by upper and lower gastrointestinal sources. Obstetrical, vascular, iatrogenic, and even urological sources have all been described. Bleeding may be either external or internal. A substantial amount of blood loss to the point of hemodynamic compromise may occur in the chest, abdomen, or retroperitoneum. The thigh itself can hold up to 1 L to 2 L of blood. Pathophysiology: Hemorrhagic shock is due to the depletion of intravascular volume through blood loss to the point of being unable to match the tissues demand for oxygen. As a result, mitochondria are no longer able to sustain aerobic metabolism for the production of oxygen and switch to the less efficient anaerobic metabolism to meet the cellular demand for adenosine triphosphate. In the latter process, pyruvate is produced and converted to lactic acid to regenerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to maintain some degree of cellular respiration in the absence of oxygen. The body compensates for volume loss by increasing heart rate and contractility, followed by baroreceptor activation resulting in sympathetic nervous system activation and peripheral vasoconstriction. Typically, there is a slight increase in the diastolic blood pressure with narrowing of the pulse pressure. As diastolic ventricular filling continues to decline and cardiac output decreases, systolic blood pressure drops. Due to sympathetic nervous system activation, blood is diverted away from noncritical organs and tissues to preserve blood supply to vital organs such as the heart and brain. While prolonging heart and brain function, this also leads to other tissues being further deprived of oxygen causing more lactic acid production and worsening acidosis. This worsening acidosis along with hypoxemia, if left uncorrected, eventually causes the loss of peripheral vasoconstriction, worsening hemodynamic compromise, and death. The body’s compensation varies by cardiopulmonary comorbidities, age, and vasoactive medications. Due to these factors, heart rate and blood pressure responses are extremely variable and, therefore, cannot be relied upon as the sole means of diagnosis.","Though most found in trauma cases, there are numerous causes of hemorrhagic (excessive bleeding) shock stemming from various organ systems. Blunt or penetrating trauma (injury) is the most common cause. Additional causes include upper and lower gastrointestinal (stomach) sources. Obstetrical (related to childbirth), vascular (related to blood vessels), iatrogenic (illness caused by medical exams), and even urological (related to the urinary tract) sources have all been described. Bleeding may be either external or internal. A substantial amount of blood loss, to the point of dysregulated (incorrect) blood flow, may occur in the chest, abdomen, or in the retroperitoneum. The retroperitoneum is area in the back of the abdomen not covered by the peritoneum. The thigh can hold up to 1 L to 2 L of blood. Hemorrhagic shock is caused by the blood loss in vessels to the point of being unable to match the tissues demand for oxygen. As a result, mitochondria (cell part responsible for making chemical energy) are unable to sustain metabolisms needed for oxygen production. Mitochondria switch to the less efficient metabolism to meet cell demand. Pyruvate, a chemical product of energy production, is produced and converted to maintain some cellular respiration (energy creation) in the absence of oxygen. The body compensates for volume loss by increasing heart rate and contractions. These alterations are followed by baroreceptor activation, which is the increased activity of receptors to regulate blood pressure. The resulting endpoints are sympathetic nervous system activation (fight-or-flight activation) and constriction of blood vessels. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and pupil size. There is normally a slight increase in the diastolic blood pressure (when the heart is relaxed) with decreased pulse pressure. As the rate in which the heart fills with blood declines and cardiac output decreases, systolic blood pressure (heart is contracting) drops. Due to sympathetic nervous system activation, blood is moved away from noncritical organs and tissues. This is done to preserve blood supply to vital organs like the heart and brain. While prolonging heart and brain function, this blood movement leads to other tissues being deprived of oxygen. This deprivation can cause more lactic acid production and a build up of acid in the blood. This acid build up along with low blood oxygen, if left uncorrected, eventually causes the loss of peripheral vasoconstriction (narrowed blood vessels), decreased blood flow, and death. How the body handles this varies by accompanying heart and lung diseases, age, and blood pressure medications. Due to these factors, heart rate and blood pressure responses are extremely different between patients. Therefore, heart rate and blood pressure cannot be the sole reasons of diagnosis.",

Superabundance of extracellular PPi explains the hard tissue complications of HPP that feature premature loss of deciduous teeth and often rickets or osteomalacia as well as calcific arthropathies in some affected adults. In infants with severe HPP, blocked entry of minerals into the skeleton can cause hypercalcemia, and insufficient hydrolysis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the major circulating form of vitamin B6, can cause pyridoxine-dependent seizures. Elevated circulating PLP is a sensitive and specific biochemical marker for HPP.

In conclusion, these results suggest that levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel improves individual quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease in addition to the improvement of motor and non-motor symptoms. Additionally, this study signals that levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel may also help with improvement of individual quality of life in caregivers.",

42,33240489,"Extracellular histones released from injured or dying cells following trauma and other severe insults can act as potent damage-associated molecular patterns. In fact, elevated levels of histones are present in human circulation in hyperinflammatory states such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. The molecular mechanisms owing to histone-induced pathologies are at the very beginning of elucidating. However, neutralization of histones with antibodies, histone-binding or histone-degrading proteins, and heparan sulfates have shown promising therapeutic effects in pre-clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis models. Various cell types undergoing necrosis and apoptosis or activated neutrophils forming neutrophil extracellular traps have been implicated in excessive release of histones which further augments tissue injury and may culminate in multiple organ failure. At the molecular level, an uncontrolled inflammatory cascade has been considered as the major event; however, histone-activated coagulation and thrombosis represent additional pathologic events reflecting coagulopathy. Furthermore, epigenetic regulation and chemical modifications of circulating histones appear to be critically important in their biological functions as evidenced by increased cytotoxicity associated with citrullinated histone. Herein, we will briefly review the current knowledge on the role of histones in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, and discuss the future potential of anti-histone therapy for treatment of these life-threatening disorders.","Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Histones that are released from injured or dying cells and remain outside of cells can lead to damaged molecules. In fact, there are high levels of histones in humans during hyperinflammatory states, when the immune system goes into overdrive, such as acute respiratory or breathing-related distress or sepsis, which occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues. Understanding this process of changes in molecules because of histones is just starting. However, making histones ineffective with antibodies (infection-fighting proteins), histones that attach to or break down proteins, and certain carbohydrate (sugar-containing) molecules that regulate functions of blood vessel walls have shown promising treatment effects in computer models of acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. Various cell types that are dying or are activated in the neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) are likely involved in too many histones being released which can worsen tissue injury and may result in multiple organ failure. An uncontrolled inflammation response is considered as the major event; however, blood clotting or scabbing because of histones are new events showing a bleeding disorder. Also, regulating how the environment can cause changes that affect the way genes work and chemical changes of histones appear to be very important in their functions. In this paper, researchers review the current knowledge of the role of histones in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, and discuss potential anti-histone treatment of these life-threatening disorders.",

We performed targeted, broad-spectrum metabolomics to gain insights into the biology of CFS. We studied a total of 84 subjects using these methods. Forty-five subjects (n = 22 men and 23 women) met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS by Institute of Medicine, Canadian, and Fukuda criteria. Thirty-nine subjects (n = 18 men and 21 women) were age- and sex-matched normal controls. Males with CFS were 53 (±2.8) y old (mean ± SEM; range, 21-67 y). Females were 52 (±2.5) y old (range, 20-67 y). The Karnofsky performance scores were 62 (±3.2) for males and 54 (±3.3) for females. We targeted 612 metabolites in plasma from 63 biochemical pathways by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization, and tandem mass spectrometry in a single-injection method. Patients with CFS showed abnormalities in 20 metabolic pathways. Eighty percent of the diagnostic metabolites were decreased, consistent with a hypometabolic syndrome. Pathway abnormalities included sphingolipid, phospholipid, purine, cholesterol, microbiome, pyrroline-5-carboxylate, riboflavin, branch chain amino acid, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial metabolism. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve analysis showed diagnostic accuracies of 94% [95% confidence interval (CI), 84-100%] in males using eight metabolites and 96% (95% CI, 86-100%) in females using 13 metabolites.

16,15257071,"Background: Renal transplant recipients were noted to appear cushingoid while on low doses of steroid as part of a triple therapy immunosuppression of cyclosporin A (CsA), prednisolone, and azathioprine. Methods: The study group comprised adult renal transplant recipients with stable graft function who had received their renal allograft a minimum of 1 year previously (43 studies undertaken in 22 men and 20 women) with median daily prednisone dose of 7 mg (range 3-10). The control group was healthy nontransplant subjects [median dose 10 mg (10-30)]. Prednisolone bioavailability was measured using a limited 6-hour area under the curve (AUC), with prednisolone measured using specific HPLC assay. Results: The median prednisolone AUC/mg dose for all transplant recipients was significantly greater than the control group by approximately 50% (316 nmol x h/L/mg prednisolone versus 218). AUC was significantly higher in female recipients (median 415 versus 297 for men) and in recipients receiving cyclosporin (348 versus 285). The highest AUC was in women on estrogen supplements who were receiving cyclosporin (median 595). A significantly higher proportion of patients on triple therapy had steroid side effects compared with those on steroid and azathioprine (17/27 versus 4/15), more women than men had side effects (14/16 versus 7/22), and the AUC/mg prednisone was greater in those with side effects than without (median 377 versus 288 nmol x h/L/mg). Discussion: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that CsA increases the bioavailability of prednisolone, most likely through inhibition of P-glycoprotein. The increased exposure to steroid increased the side-effect profile of steroids in the majority of patients. Because the major contributor to AUC is the maximum postdose concentration, it may be possible to use single-point monitoring (2 hours postdose) for routine clinical studies.","Kidney transplant receivers appeared puffy and obese while on low doses of steroid from a three-part therapy of immunosuppressive drugs including cyclosporin A (CsA), prednisolone, and azathioprine. The treatment group had adult kidney transplant receivers with stable transplants who had received their kidney transplant at least 1 year ago (43 studies done in 22 men and 20 women) with average daily immunosuppressive prednisone dose. The baseline group was healthy nontransplant patients. The average immunosuppressive prednisolone dose measurement for all transplant receivers was higher than the baseline group by around 50%. A certain test score was higher in female receivers and receivers taking the immunosuppressive cyclosporin drug. The highest score was in women on estrogen supplements taking the cyclosporin drug. More patients on the three-part therapy had steroid side effects versus those on steroid and the immunosuppressive azathioprine drug (17/27 versus 4/15). More women than men had side effects (14/16 versus 7/22). The immunosuppressive prednisone drug score was higher in those with side effects than without. CsA drug increases the usuable amount of immunosuppressive prednisolone drug. The increased exposure to steroid increased steroid side effect severity in a majority of patients. Since the major contributor to test scores was maximum post-dose concentration, single-point monitoring (monitoring 2 hours post-dose) may be used for routine studies.","People who received a renal (kidney) transplant appear cushingoid (having different symptoms, often facial puffiness and weight gain, due to too much of the hormone cortisol in the body) while on low doses of steroid as part of multiple drug treatments, including prednisolone. The study group has adult kidney transplant patients with stable functions within the transplanted kidney who got the kidney at least a year ago along with an average daily prednisone dose of 7 mg. The comparison group is healthy people who did not receive a transplant. Prednisolone bioavailability (how much of a drug becomes completely available to the intended part of the body) is measured using an area under the curve (a measure of total exposure to the drug in the body's systems), with prednisolone measured using HPLC, or high performance liquid chromatographic (a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze). The prednisolone area under the curve for all transplant patients is significantly greater than the comparison group of healthy non-transplant patients. Area under the curve measurements are much higher in females patients and in patients receiving cyclosporin, a drug that prevents the body from rejecting a transplant. The highest area under the curve measurement is in women on estrogen supplements (pills taken, often to resolve symptoms related to menopause) who are taking cyclosporin. A significantly higher proportion of patients on multiple-drug therapy had steroid side effects compared with those on steroid and azathioprine (a drug that can prevent organ rejection after a transplant). More women than men had side effects, and the area under the curve prednisone was greater in those with side effects than without. The results are consistent with the suggestion that cyclosporin A increases the bioavailability (how much of a drug becomes completely available to the intended part of the body) of prednisolone. The increased exposure to the steroid increased the side effects of steroids in most of the patients. It may be possible to use single-point monitoring (one time measurement) 2 hours after the dose for routine clinical studies."
44,25565640,"Current monitoring technologies are unable to detect early, compensatory changes that are associated with significant blood loss. We previously introduced a novel algorithm to calculate the Compensatory Reserve Index (CRI) based on the analysis of arterial waveform features obtained from photoplethysmogram recordings. In the present study, we hypothesized that the CRI would provide greater sensitivity and specificity to detect blood loss compared with traditional vital signs and other hemodynamic measures. Continuous noninvasive vital sign waveform data, including CRI, photoplethysmogram, heart rate, blood pressures, SpO2, cardiac output, and stroke volume, were analyzed from 20 subjects before, during, and after an average controlled voluntary hemorrhage of ∼1.2 L of blood. Compensatory Reserve Index decreased by 33% in a linear fashion across progressive blood volume loss, with no clinically significant alterations in vital signs. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve for the CRI was 0.90, with a sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.76. In comparison, blood pressures, heart rate, SpO2, cardiac output, and stroke volume had significantly lower receiver operating characteristic area under the curve values and specificities for detecting the same volume of blood loss. Consistent with our hypothesis, CRI detected blood loss and restoration with significantly greater specificity than did other traditional physiologic measures. Single measurement of CRI may enable more accurate triage, whereas CRI monitoring may allow for earlier detection of casualty deterioration.","Current monitoring technologies cannot detect early, counterbalancing changes associated with significant blood loss. We previously showed a new mathematical equation to calculate the counterbalancing blood flow mechanics or Compensatory Reserve Index (CRI) based on analysis of blood vessel wave patterns from blood flow recordings. In the present study, we theorized that CRI would give better accuracy to detect blood loss compared to standard vital signs and other blood flow measures. We analyzed 20 subjects before, during, and after a regular, controlled voluntary blood loss of 1.2 liters for continuous non-surgical vital sign wave data, including CRI, recordings, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, blood flow output, and blood volume. CRI decreased by 33% in a linear trend across increasing blood volume loss, with no changes in vital signs. CRI had high accuracy for detecting blood volume loss. In comparison, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels, blood flow output and blood volume had less accuracy for detecting the same amount of blood loss. Consistent with out theory, CRI detected blood loss and restoration better than other traditional body measures. Single measurement of CRI may enable better identification, while CRI monitoring may allow earlier detection of patient status trending towards death.","Current monitoring technologies are unable to detect early changes associated with significant blood loss. A novel model to calculate the Compensatory Reserve Index (CRI) was previously introduced by the authors in a secondary study. CRI measures physiological reserve, or how an organ responds to stress, which can be used as an indicator of how a patient will respond to intensive care. In the present study, the authors hypothesized that the CRI would provide greater sensitivity and specificity to detect blood loss compared to traditional methods. Vital signs were analyzed from 20 subjects before, during, and after an average controlled voluntary hemorrhage (excessive blood loss) of ∼1.2 L of blood. CRI decreased across progressive blood volume loss, with no clinically significant alterations in vital signs. Statistical analysis of CRI showed high confidence in the ability of the test to produce accurate results. In contrast, blood pressures, heart rate, SpO2, cardiac output, and stroke volume had significantly lower confidence for detection and specificity rates. CRI detected blood loss and restoration with greater specificity than did other traditional measures. Single measurement of CRI may enable more accurate assessment of health emergencies. CRI monitoring may allow for earlier detection of declining health."
7,33178623,"The most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis is infection by Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), commonly known as strep throat. 5-15% of adults and 15-35% of children in the United States with pharyngitis have a GABHS infection. The symptoms of GABHS overlap with non-GABHS and viral causes of acute pharyngitis, complicating the problem of diagnosis. A careful physical examination and patient history is the starting point for diagnosing GABHS. After a physical examination and patient history is completed, five types of diagnostic methods can be used to ascertain the presence of a GABHS infection: clinical scoring systems, rapid antigen detection tests, throat culture, nucleic acid amplification tests, and machine learning and artificial intelligence. Clinical guidelines developed by professional associations can help medical professionals choose among available techniques to diagnose strep throat. However, guidelines for diagnosing GABHS created by the American and European professional associations vary significantly, and there is substantial evidence that most physicians do not follow any published guidelines. Treatment for GABHS using analgesics, antipyretics, and antibiotics seeks to provide symptom relief, shorten the duration of illness, prevent nonsuppurative and suppurative complications, and decrease the risk of contagion, while minimizing the unnecessary use of antibiotics. There is broad agreement that antibiotics with narrow spectrums of activity are appropriate for treating strep throat. But whether and when patients should be treated with antibiotics for GABHS remains a controversial question. There is no clearly superior management strategy for strep throat, as significant controversy exists regarding the best methods to diagnose GABHS and under what conditions antibiotics should be prescribed.","Strep throat caused by bacteria is most commonly caused by group A strep bacteria. 5-15% of adults and 15-35% children in the United States with strep throat have a group A strep bacteria infection. The symptoms of group A strep bacteria are similar to short-term strep throat caused by viruses and other bacteria, which makes strep throat hard to diagnose. Diagnosing strep throat caused by group A strep bacteria begins with a careful physical exam and patient history. Following a physical exam and patient history, there are five ways to diagnose strep throat caused by group A strep bacteria: scoring systems, rapid antigen tests to find strep bacterial fragments, throat swabs to grow strep bacteria, tests for strep genetic material, and computer predictions. Clinical guidelines written by professional groups can help doctors choose which way to diagnose strep throat. However, guidelines for diagnosing group A strep throat created by professional groups in the United States and Europe differ, and many doctors do not follow any guidelines. Treating group A strep throat with painkillers, fever-reducers, and antibiotics aims to relieve symptoms, shorten illness length, prevent later medical problems with pus or without pus, and decrease the spread, while reducing the use of antibiotics when they are not needed. Experts agree that antibiotics that kill fewer bacteria are best to treat strep throat. Experts do not agree whether and when people with group A strep throat should be given antibiotics. There is no best way to treat strep throat, as experts do not agree on the best way to diagnose group A strep throat and when antibiotics should be given.",
18,19640342,"Current controversies for medical nutrition therapy in pregnancies complicated by diabetes include the composition and amount of carbohydrates and fats as well as optimal gestational weight gain and energy restriction. Although carbohydrate is the macronutrient with the greatest effect on glycemic control, there is little evidence for a recommended amount and type of carbohydrate or its distribution. This lack of evidence prompts an issue of debate among practitioners over the type of carbohydrate and its percent distribution throughout the day. The best indicators at this time are the results of self-monitoring of blood glucose, ketone testing, food records, and weight gain. A review of the literature provides the most current information available for medical nutrition therapy during a pregnancy complicated by diabetes and reinforces the need for further research in the form of randomized controlled trials to answer questions regarding carbohydrate modification and distribution, energy needs, and weight gain.","Current controversies and arguments for nutrition therapy (treatment based on food) in pregnancies that are complicated by diabetes (a chronic health condition that affects how the body turns food into energy) include the amount of carbohydrates (carbs) and fats, the best amount of weight to gain during pregnancy, and the best way to limit calories. There is little evidence for a recommended amount and type of carb or how it is distributed. This lack of evidence creates a disagreement among health care providers over the type of carb and amount that should be eaten throughout the day. The best measures at this time are the results of self-monitoring of blood sugar, testing for ketones (substances that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar), food diaries, and weight gain.

45,30086256,"Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of topical pentoxifylline (PTX) on pressure ulcer (PU) healing in critically ill patients. Method: In this randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients with category I or II PUs were randomly assigned to receive either topical PTX 5% or a placebo twice daily for 14 days. Changes in PU characteristics (category and size) were assessed. The category of the PU was determined by the Stirling Pressure Ulcer Severity Scale (two-digit) at baseline (day zero), day seven and day 14 of treatment. PU length and width was measured with a disposable ruler and expressed as cm2. Results: A total of 112 adult patients were enrolled in the study. Median PU size and score at day zero were 32 (10.00-69.33)cm2 and 1(1.00-2.00) respectively. In the PTX group, the mean differences (95% confidence interval, CI) of all PU scores and sizes decreased significantly across the intervals (day seven versus day zero, day 14 versus day zero, and day 14 versus day seven), compared with the placebo group Conclusion: The severity and size of PUs improved significantly in patients who received topical PTX 5% ointment twice a day for 14 days compared with those in the placebo group. Topical PTX may be considered as a potential option in the treatment of categories I and II PUs in critically ill patients.","The study's objective is to evaulate the success of topical pentoxifylline (PTX) (a blood flow medication) on pressure ulcer (PU), or bedsore, healing in very ill patients. In this study, patients with mild or moderate PUs were randomly assigned to receive either skin-level PTX 5% or a sham treatment twice daily for 14 days. Changes in PU (severity and size) were measured. The severity of PU was determined with a special scale at starting (day zero), day seven, and day 14 of the treatment. PU length and width was measured with a ruler in cm2. 112 adult patients enrolled in the study. Average PU size and score at day 0 were 32 cm2 and 1 respectively. In the PTX group, the average differences of all PU scores and sizes decreased greatly across the intervals (day seven vs day zero, day 14 vs day zero, and day 14 vs day seven), compared with the sham treatment group. The severity and size of PUs improved greatly in patients who received skin-level PTX 5% ointment twice a day for 14 days compared to those in the dummy treatment group. Skin-level PTX may be a possible option to treat mild and moderate PUs in very ill patients.","We aimed to rate how well pentoxifylline (PTX) applied to the skin worked to heal bedsores in critically ill patients. This was a medical study involving human participants in which neither side knew who was getting what treatment, and either PTX 5% or ointment with no medicine was applied to the skin twice a day for 14 days. We measured changes in bedsore category and size. We used a common scoring system to measure the severity of bedsores and bedsore stage at the beginning of the study and on study days 7 and 14. We measured bedsore length and width with a disposable ruler. We studied a total of 112 adult patients. Median (average) bedsore size and score at the beginning of the study were 32cm2 and 1, respectively. The average differences of bedsore scores and sizes decreased significantly between measurement days (day seven versus day zero, day 14 versus day zero, and day 14 versus day seven) compared to the ointment with no medicine. We conclude that the seriousness and size of bedsores improved significantly in patients who received PTX 5% ointment applied to the skin twice a day for 14 days compared to those who received ointment with no medicine. PTX applied to the skin may be a potential treatment option for stage I or II bedsores in critically ill patients."
6,16127951,"The proper treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on recognition of the signs and symptoms of the disease and determination of the etiology. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease. Other common causes include thyroiditis, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenomas, and side effects of certain medications. The diagnostic workup begins with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level test. When test results are uncertain, measuring radionuclide uptake helps distinguish among possible causes. When thyroiditis is the cause, symptomatic treatment usually is sufficient because the associated hyperthyroidism is transient. Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma can be treated with radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery, but in the United States, radioactive iodine is the treatment of choice in patients without contraindications. Thyroidectomy is an option when other treatments fail or are contraindicated, or when a goiter is causing compressive symptoms. Some new therapies are under investigation. Special treatment consideration must be given to patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, as well as those with Graves' ophthalmopathy or amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Patients' desires must be considered when deciding on appropriate therapy, and dose monitoring is essential.","Successfully treating an overactive thyroid depends on identifying the signs and symptoms of the disease and determining the cause. Graves' disease, a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells, is the most common cause of an overactive thyroid. Other common causes of an overactive thyroid include thyroid inflammation, one or more glandular growths making extra thyroid hormone, and side effects of some medications. A common test that measures blood levels of hormones that acts as messengers to the thyroid is the first step in a medical exam. When results of this test are uncertain, a test to measure thyroid function can be used. When the cause is inflammation of the thyroid, treating the symptoms is enough because the overactive thyroid is short-lived. Graves' disease and when one or more growths make extra thyroid hormone can be treated with radiation therapy, drugs that block the formation of thyroid hormone, or surgery. In the United States, radiation therapy to shrink the thyroid is preferred unless there is a reason not to do so. Thyroid removal is an option when other treatments do not work or should not be used, or when an enlarged thyroid is causing pressure or squeezing. New treatments are being studied. People who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and people with thyroid eye disease or overactive thyroids caused by amiodarone, a heart medication, must be given special treatment consideration. We must factor in what patients want when deciding on treatment. Maintaining a safe and effective dose is very important.",

18,10521751,"Objective: The object of the study was to determine whether time of day, interval after a standard meal, and maternal body mass influence plasma glucose concentrations in women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Study design: Identical mixed meals were administered on 2 separate occasions 1 week apart to 30 women with dietarily treated gestational diabetes and pregnancies between 28 and 38 weeks' gestation. One meal was administered at 7 AM (morning meal) and the other was administered at 9 PM (evening meal), each after a fast of >/=5 hours. The order of the meals (morning first versus evening first) was assigned randomly. Sixteen of the women had a body mass index >/=27 kg/m(2) (overweight) and 14 women had a body mass index <27 kg/m(2) (lean). Venous plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and bound and free cortisol were measured hourly for 9 hours after each of the test meals. Results: When all women were considered together glucose concentrations after the morning meal were significantly greater at 1 hour, were not different at 2 hours, and were significantly lower from 3 through 9 hours postprandially than those at corresponding times after the evening meal. Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acid concentrations were higher between 5 and 9 hours after the morning meal than at the same times after the evening meal. Total and free cortisol levels were higher for the first 7 hours after the morning feeding, reflecting known diurnal variation in cortisol concentrations. Overweight patients' glucose values were significantly greater than those of lean subjects during the last 4 hours of the overnight fast. Conclusions: Among women with dietarily treated gestational diabetes the glucose concentrations were significantly higher from 3 to 9 hours after an evening meal, whereas suppression of free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate was less sustained after a morning feeding. The mechanisms underlying these differences remain to be determined but may involve diurnal influences of counterregulatory hormones. The relationships between measurements of maternal glycemia and maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes may be clarified by establishing a uniform duration of a fast and by developing meal-specific preprandial and postprandial maternal glucose targets for these patients.","The objective of this study is to determine whether time of day, the interval after a standard meal, and maternal body mass (body fat based on height and weight) influence the amount of blood sugar in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (a type of diabetes first seen during pregnancy in a woman who did not have diabetes before pregnancy). Identical mixed meals are given on 2 separate occasions 1 week apart to 30 women with gestational diabetes being treated by diet and who are pregnant. One meal is given at 7 am (morning meal) and the second meal is given at 9 pm (evening meal), each after a fast (no food) of 5 or more hours. The order of the meals (morning first versus evening first) is assigned randomly. Based on body mass index, 16 of the women are considered overweight, and 14 women are lean. Blood sugar from the vein, insulin (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood), free fatty acids (lipids from fats and oils that are a source of energy for the body), beta-hydroxybutyrate (a chemical in the body that provides energy when not enough carbohydrates or sugars have been eaten), and bound and free cortisol (a stress hormone that is bound to proteins or free in the blood) are measured hourly for 9 hours after each of the test meals. When all women are measured together, blood sugar after the morning meal is much greater at 1 hour, are not different at 2 hours, and are much lower 3 through 9 hours after the meal than measurements taken at the same times after the evening meal. The chemical beta-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acid levels are higher between 5 and 9 hours after the morning meal than at the same times after the evening meal. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol are higher for the first 7 hours after the morning meal, reflecting known daily variation in cortisol concentrations. Overweight patients' blood sugar levels are much greater than those of lean patients during the last 4 hours of the overnight fast. In conclusion, among women with gestational diabetes, the blood sugar levels are much higher from 3 to 9 hours after an evening meal, whereas slowing or stopping free fatty acid and beta-hydroxybutyrate use is less stable after a morning meal. The process causing these differences remain to be found but may involve daily influences of hormones that increase blood sugar. The relationships between measurements of blood sugar in pregnant women and maternal and perinatal (before and after birth) outcomes in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes may be cleared up by creating a standard time to fast and by developing meal-specific maternal blood sugar levels to aim to reach before and after meals for these patients.",
37,24532157,"Objective: Long-term benzodiazepine (BDZ) use and dependence affect cognitive functioning adversely and partly irreversibly. Emerging evidence suggests that pregabalin (PGB) might be a safe and efficacious treatment of long-term BDZ use. The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in several core cognitive functions after successful treatment of long-term BDZ use and dependence with PGB. Methods: Fourteen patients with long-term BDZ use (mean duration >15 years) underwent neuropsychological assessment with the mini-mental state examination and four tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) battery before the initiation of PGB treatment and at a two months follow-up after the cessation of BDZs. Patients' CANTAB percentile score distributions were compared with normative CANTAB data. Results: Patients improved on cognitive measures of global cognitive functioning, time orientation, psychomotor speed, and visuospatial memory and learning with strong effect sizes. By contrast, they failed to improve on measures of attentional flexibility. Despite their significant improvement, patients' scores on most tests remained still at the lower percentiles of CANTAB normative scores. Conclusions: Although preliminary, our findings suggest that successful treatment of long-term BDZ use with PGB is associated with a substantial, though only partial, recovery of BDZ-compromised neuropsychological functioning, at least at a 2-month follow-up.","Benzodiazepines (BDZ) are drugs that are often used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms, and seixures. Long-term BDZ use and dependence negatively affect cognitive functioning (thinking ability). These effects can be partially irreversible. New evidence suggests that pregabalin (PGB) might be a safe and effective treatment of long-term BDZ use. The goal of the study was investigate the changes in cognitive function after successful treatment of long-term BDZ use and dependence with PGB. Fourteen patients with long-term BDZ use underwent several neurological (brain-related) and cognititive function tests. These evaluations were conducted before the initiation of PGB treatment and at a two months follow-up after the cessation (stopping) of BDZs. Patients' scores from the tests were compared with control data. Patients improved on several cognitive measures with strong effect sizes. By contrast, they failed to improve on measures of attentional flexibility (the ability to shift focus). Despite their significant improvement, patients' scores on most tests were low when compared to control scores. The study findings suggest that successful treatment of long-term BDZ use with PGB is associated (linked) with a substantial, though only partial, recovery of BDZ-compromised brain function, at least at a 2-month follow-up.",
32,32278343,"Background: Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) is a risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The C677T 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism increases homocysteine (HCY) levels. This study analyzed the relationship between C677T MTHFR polymorphism and the therapeutic effect of lowering HCY in stroke patients with HHCY. Methods: Baseline data were collected from stroke patients with HHCY for this prospective cohort study. The C677T MTHFR genotype was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and the therapeutic effect to reduce HCY was compared. Results: Of 200 stroke patients 162 (81.0%) completed follow-up and were evaluated. Most of them responded well to treatment (103 cases, 63.5%), but 59 (36.4%) patients were in the poor efficacy group. There was a significant difference in terms of age (P < 0.001), hypertension (P = 0.041), hyperuricemia (P = 0.042), HCY after treatment (P < 0.001), and MTHFR genotype (P < 0.001) between the poor efficacy and effective groups, with increased frequency of the TT genotype in the poor efficacy group. Logistic regression showed that the T allele was associated with poor efficacy (OR = 0.733, 95%CI: 0.693, 0.862, P < 0.001). In the codominant model the TT genotype was associated with poor outcome (OR = 0.862, 95%CI: 0.767, 0.970, P = 0.017) and this was also the case in the recessive model (OR = 0.585, 95%CI: 0.462, 0.741, P < 0.001) but there was no association between CT and TT in the dominant model. Conclusions: The T allele and TT genotype of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with poor HCY reduction treatment efficacy in stroke patients with HHCY.","Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY), when there is excess homocysteine in the blood, is a risk factor for cardiovascular, or blood- and heart-related, and cerebrovascular, or blood- and brain-related, diseases. Homocysteine is an intermediate amino acid (molecule that form proteins). A specific genetic variation or gene change, known as C677T 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism, which alters the MTHFR protein involved in blood pressure, increases homocysteine (HCY) levels. This study analyzed the relationship between C677T MTHFR variation and the therapeutic, beneficial effect (response after a treatment) of lowering HCY in stroke patients with HHCY. Baseline data, meaning prior to treatment, was collected from stroke patients with HHCY for this study. The C677T MTHFR genotype was detected, and the therapeutic effect to reduce HCY was compared. Of 200 stroke patients, 162 completed follow-up and were evaluated. Most of them responded well to treatment, but 59 patients were in the poor efficacy or poor effect group. There was a significant difference in terms of age, hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperuricemia (high uric acid or waste), HCY after treatment, and MTHFR genotype between the poor efficacy and effective groups. The poor efficacy group had more participated with TT genotype of the genetic variant. Statistical analysis showed that the T allele (an alternative form of a gene) was associated with poor efficacy. The TT genotype was associated with poor outcomes. The study concluded the T allele and TT genotype of the MTHFR C677T genetic variation was associated with poor HCY reduction treatment efficacy in stroke patients with HHCY.",
24,11097963,"Objective: Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (N=107) who had been long-term benzodiazepine users (average duration of use=8.5 years) were enrolled in a benzodiazepine discontinuation program that assessed the effectiveness of concomitant imipramine (180 mg/day) and buspirone (38 mg/day) compared to placebo in facilitating benzodiazepine discontinuation. Method: After a benzodiazepine stabilization period taking either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam, patients were treated for 4 weeks with imipramine, buspirone, or placebo under double-blind conditions while benzodiazepine intake was kept stable (treatment phase). Patients then entered a 4-6 week benzodiazepine taper and a 5-week posttaper phase with imipramine, buspirone, and placebo treatment being continued until 3 weeks into the posttaper phase, at which time all patients were switched to placebo for 2 weeks. Benzodiazepine plasma levels were assayed weekly. Benzodiazepine-free status was assessed 3 and 12 months posttaper. Results: Study subjects were long-term benzodiazepine users with an average of three unsuccessful prior taper attempts. The success rate of the taper in this study was significantly higher for patients who received imipramine (82.6%), and nonsignificantly higher for patients who received buspirone (67.9%), than for patients who received placebo (37.5%). The imipramine effect remained highly significant even after the analysis adjusted for three other independent predictors of taper success: benzodiazepine dose, level of anxious symptoms at baseline, and duration of benzodiazepine therapy. Conclusions: Management of benzodiazepine discontinuation can be facilitated significantly by co-prescribing imipramine before and during the benzodiazepine taper. Daily benzodiazepine dose, severity of baseline symptoms of anxiety and depression, and duration of benzodiazepine use were additional significant predictors of successful taper outcome.","107 patients with diagnosed anxiety and who used anxiety-reducing benzodiazepine drugs (for 8.5 years on average) entered a program that ended their drug use. The program measured how antidepressant imipramine (180 mg/day) and anxiety-reducing busprione (38 mg/day) helps end benzodiazepine use compared to inactive treatment. After using either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam (anxiety-reducing benzodiazepines) for a period of time, patients used imipramine, busprione, or an inactive placebo for 4 weeks while benzodiazepine usage was stable. For 4-6 weeks, patients lessened benzodiazepine use. Then, for 5 weeks, patients kept using imipramine, busiprone, and inactive treatment until 3 weeks in this 5-week phase, at which all patients switched to inactive treatment for 2 weeks. Benzodiazepine blood levels were measured weekly. Benzodiazepine-free status was checked 3 and 12 months after treatment. Patients were long-term benzodiazepine users with an average of three failed attempts to lessen drug use. Success rate for lessening drug use was higher for patients taking imipramine (82.6%) and not much higher for patients taking buspirone (67.9%) compared to patients taking the inactive placebo (37.5%). The imipramine effect was still high even after accounting for benzodiazepine dose, baseline level of anxious symptoms, and duration of benzodiazepine treatment. Ending benzodiazepine drug use can be helped by using imipramine before and during the period of benzodiazepine drug use reduction. Daily benzodiazepine dose, severity of starting symptoms of anxiety and depression, and length of benzodiazepine use help predict successful reduction of drug use.","We enrolled 107 patients with generalized anxiety disorder who had been long-term benzodiazepine users (average length of use=8.5 years) in a program to discontinue benzodiazepines to measure how well other anxiety-reducing drugs like imipramine (180 mg/day) and buspirone (38 mg/day) helped patients wean or discontinue benzodiazepines compared to sugar pills. After a period to stabilize benzodiazepine levels taking either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam, patients took imipramine, buspirone, or sugar pills for 4 weeks while the amount of benzodiazepines taken were kept the same (treatment phase). Patients then slowly decreased the amount of benzodiazepines taken for 4-6 weeks, took imipramine, buspirone, and sugar pills for the next 3 weeks, and then took sugar pills for 2 weeks. Blood benzodiazepine levels were measured weekly using a common lab test. We measured how many patients no longer had benzodiazepine in their blood 3 and 12 months after the last sugar pill. Study participants had used benzodiazepines for a long time and had tried an average of three times to decrease the amount of benzodiazepines taken. Patients who took imipramine were significantly more successful in decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken (82.6%), nonsignificantly more successful regarding patients who took buspirone (67.9%), than for patients who took sugar pills (37.5%). Imipramine helped even after factoring in other factors to weaning success: amount of benzodiazepines taken, level of anxious feelings prior to weaning, and how long benzodiazepines have been taken. We concluded that discontinuing benzodiazepines can be done more easily by giving patients imipramine before and during the process of slowly decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken over time. Amount of benzodiazepines taken daily, level of anxiety and depression prior to weaning, and how long benzodiazepines have been taken also predicted success of slowly decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken."
47,34258332,"Background: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is an inborn disease caused by pathogenic variants in ALPL. Low levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are a biochemical hallmark of the disease. Scarce knowledge about the prevalence of HPP in Scandinavia exists, and the variable clinical presentations make diagnostics challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of ALPL variants as well as the clinical and biochemical features among adults with endocrinological diagnoses and persistent hypophosphatasaemia. Methods: A biochemical database containing ALP measurements of 26,121 individuals was reviewed to identify adults above 18 years of age with persistently low levels of ALP beneath range (≤ 35 ± 2.7 U/L). ALPL genetic testing, biochemical evaluations and assessment of clinical features by a systematic questionnaire among included patients, were performed. Results: Among 24 participants, thirteen subjects (54.2%) revealed a disease-causing variant in ALPL and reported mild clinical features of HPP, of which musculoskeletal pain was the most frequently reported (n = 9). The variant c. 571G > A; p.(Glu191 Lys) was identified in six subjects, and an unreported missense variant (c.1019A > C; p.(His340Pro)) as well as a deletion of exon 2 were detected by genetic screening. Biochemical analyses showed no significant differences in ALP (p = 0.059), the bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) (p = 0.056) and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) (p = 0.085) between patients with an ALPL variant and negative genetic screening. Patients with a variant in ALPL had significantly higher PLP levels than healthy controls (p = 0.002). We observed normal ALP activity in some patients classified as mild HPP, and slightly increased levels of PLP in two subjects with normal genetic screening and four healthy controls. Among 51 patients with persistent hypophosphatasaemia, fifteen subjects (29.4%) received antiresorptive treatment. Two patients with unrecognized HPP were treated with bisphosphonates and did not show complications due to the treatment. Conclusions: Pathogenic variants in ALPL are common among patients with endocrinological diagnoses and low ALP. Regarding diagnostics, genetic testing is necessary to identify mild HPP due to fluctuating biochemical findings. Antiresorptive treatment is a frequent reason for hypophosphatasaemia and effects of these agents in adults with a variant in ALPL and osteoporosis remain unclear and require further studies.","Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a disease caused by mutations within the gene ALPL. Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is the heritable, tooth and bone disease. The gene ALPL encodes for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an enzyme that helps bone strength. Low levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are a hallmark of the disease. There is little knowledge about the prevalence of HPP in Scandinavia. Due to the variation in HPP clinical presentations, diagnosing the disease is challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of ALPL variants (gene types). The study also aimed to identify HPP biological identifiers among adults. This study was specifically interested in adults with HPP along with endocrine (hormonal) disorders and persistent hypophosphatasemia (low body phosphorus levels). A database containing ALP measurements of 26,121 individuals was reviewed to identify adults above 18 years of age with persistently low levels of ALP. ALPL genetic testing, evaluation of body compound levels, and assessment of health by a systematic questionnaire among included patients, were performed. Among 24 participants, thirteen subjects revealed a disease-causing variant in ALPL and reported mild health effects of HPP. Of these mild health effects, musculoskeletal pain was the most frequently reported. The same genetic variant was identified in six subjects. An unreported missense (gene-altered) variant and a genetic deletion were detected by genetic screening. Analysis of compound levels within the body showed no significant differences between patients with an ALPL variant and negative (no-detection) genetic screening. Patients with a variant in ALPL had significantly higher PLP levels than control patients. Normal ALP activity was observed in some patients classified as mild HPP. A slightly increased level of PLP was found in two subjects with normal genetic screening and four healthy controls. Among 51 patients with persistent hypophosphatasemia, 15 received treatment to increase bone strength. Two patients with undiagnosed HPP were treated with bisphosphonates, drugs that slow bone loss. They did not show complications due to the treatment. Genetic variations in ALPL are common among patients with endocrine disorders and low ALP. Genetic testing is necessary to identify mild HPP due to fluctuating body compound level findings. Treatment to increase bone strength is a frequent reason for hypophosphatasemia. Effects of these agents in adults with a variant in ALPL and osteoporosis (brittle bones) remain unclear and require further studies.","Low levels of blood phosphate, a high-energy molecule, or hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a from-birth disease caused by disease-causing variations in ALPL (the gene for alkaline phosphatase or a protein that influences phosphate levels).

ALPL gene testing, biological tests, and assessment of symptoms by a questionnaire among included patients were performed. Among 24 patients, thirteen (54.2%) had a disease-causing variant in ALPL and mild symptoms of HPP, of which musculoskeletal pain was the most frequent. A specific gene mutation that altered a protein segment was found in six subjects. A similar gene mutation and deletion of a gene segment was detected by genetic tests. Tests showed no differences in ALP, bone-specific ALP, and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) or active vitamin B6 between patients with an ALPL mutation and no genetic diseases. Patients with an ALPL mutation had much higher PLP levels than healthy patients. We saw normal ALP activity in some patients with mild HPP. We also saw slightly increased PLP in two subjects with no gene diseases and four healthy patients. Among 51 with persistent low ALP levels, fifteen (29.4%) had anti-bone-breakdown treatment.

26,33029620,"Defining the duration of infectivity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has major implications for public health and infection control practice in healthcare facilities. Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required 2 negative RT-PCR tests before discontinuing isolation in patients with Covid-19. Many patients, however, have persistently positive RT-PCR tests for weeks to months following clinical recovery, and multiple studies now indicate that these generally do not reflect replication-competent virus. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be most contagious around the time of symptom onset, and infectivity rapidly decreases thereafter to near-zero after about 10 days in mild-moderately ill patients and 15 days in severely-critically ill and immunocompromised patients. The longest interval associated with replication-competent virus thus far is 20 days from symptom onset. This review summarizes evidence-to-date on the duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and how this has informed evolving public health recommendations on when it is safe to discontinue isolation precautions.","Defining the period of time someone can spread Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, to others can positively impact public health and prevent infection spreading within healthcare facilities. COVID-19 is a harmful, breathing-related, viral disease. Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required two negative (or undetected) COVID-19 tests before COVID-19 infected patients could come out of quarantine (isolation). However, several COVID-19 patients continually test positive (with COVID-19 detected) after clinically recovering from the virus. Based on several reports, this is not believed to be the norm for the replication-competent virus, or a virus that is able to reproduce itself in one person and infect other people. The virus appears to be contagious (easily spread) around the time symptoms first appear. The ability of the virus to spread decreases as symptoms progress. The ability of the virus to spread becomes near-zero around 10 days in mild to moderately ill patients. The ability of the virus to spread becomes near-zero around 15 days in severely to critically ill and immunocompromised (those with decreased immune system function) patients. The longest documented duration between symptom onset and viral spread is 20 days. This review summarizes the most recent evidence on the length of time COVID-19 is able to spread from one patient to another. Additionally, this paper states how this knowledge has helped create improved COVID-19 mandates or rules on quarantine lengths.","Defining the duration of infectvity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronovirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a viral breathing-related illness, can influence public health and infection control practice for healthcare.

36,34314230,"Background Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the first choice treatment of renal stones larger than 2 cm. We aimed to evaluate if lasers perform as equal as non-laser devices in patients with kidney stones candidate to PCNL. Materials and methods A comprehensive literature search was performed in MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to assess the differences in the perioperative course, incidence of postoperative complications, and stone free-rate (SFR) in patients with kidney stones undergoing laser versus non-laser PCNL in randomized studies. The incidences of complications were pooled using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Method with the random effect model and expressed as Risk Ratios (RR), 95% Confidence Intervals (CI), and p-values. Surgical time and length of stay were pooled using the inverse variance of the mean difference (MD) with a random effect, 95% CI, and p-values. Analyses were two-tailed, with a significance set at p ≤0.05. Results Six papers including 732 patients (311 patients undergoing holmium laser and 421 non-laser PCNL) were included in meta-analysis. Surgical time and postoperative stay were shorter in the non-laser group (MD:11.14, 95% CI:2.32-19.96, p=0.002; MD:-0.81, 95%CI:-2.18-0.57 p=0.25, respectively). SFR was significantly higher in the non-laser group (RR:1.08, 95% CI:1.01-1.15, p=0.03). Patients undergoing laser PCNL had a non-significant higher risk of postoperative fever >38°C (RR:0.64, 95%CI: .31-1.30, p=0.22). Transfusion rate did not differ between the two groups (RR:1.02, 95% CI:0.50-2.11 p=0.95). The need for stent positioning due to urine extravasation was higher risk in the laser group but the difference did not reach significance (RR:0.49, 95% CI:0.17-1.41 p=0.19). Conclusions Non-laser PCNL showed better perioperative outcomes and SFR as compared to holmium laser PCNL.","Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a procedure that involves making an incision in the skin, inserting a tube to reach the stone, breaking it up into small pieces - sometimes using a laser, and removing it from the body. PCNL is the first choice treatment of kidney stones larger than 2 cm. This study aims to evaluate if lasers perform as well as non-laser devices in patients with kidney stones. Researchers searched published studies to find the differences in the preparation before or during surgery, the number of complications after surgery, and the stone-free rate (patients that no longer have stone or stone fragments) in patients with kidney stones who had either laser or non-laser PCNL. The number of complications are pooled together and analyzed. How long the procedure takes and length of stay at the hospital or doctor office are also analyzed. Six papers including 732 patients (311 patients underwent the procedure with a laser PCNL and 421 with a non-laser PCNL) are included in the analysis. Surgical time and post-operation stay were shorter in the non-laser group. The stone free rate is significantly higher in the non-laser group. Patients undergoing laser PCNL had a slightly higher risk of a fever >100.4°F after the procedure. The need for a blood transfusion (transfer) is not different between the laser and non-laser group. There is a higher need in the laser group for a thin tube called a stent to be placed in the body to help drain urine, but it is not a major difference between the two groups on needing a stent. In conclusion, non-laser percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) shows better surgical outcomes and a better stone free rate when compared to the laser PCNL.",

39,34654834,"Lung cancer accounts for more than half of the new cancers diagnosed world-wide with poor survival rates. Despite the development of chemical, radiological, and immunotherapies, many patients do not benefit from these therapies, as recurrence is common. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis using Fluidigm C1 systems to characterize human lung cancer transcriptomes at single-cell resolution. Validation of scRNA-seq differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) found a positive correlation in fold-change values between C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) and 2 (CXCL2) compared with bulk-cell level in 34 primary lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) from Stage I patients. Furthermore, we discovered an inverse correlation between chemokine mRNAs, miR-532-5p, and miR-1266-3p in early-stage primary LUADs. Specially, miR-532-5p was quantifiable in plasma from the corresponding LUADs. Collectively, we identified markers of early-stage lung cancer that were validated in primary lung tumors and circulating blood.","Lung cancer accounts for more than half of the new cancers diagnosed world-wide. Lung cancer patients have poor survival rates. Despite the development of several therapy types, many patients do not benefit from these therapies. Recurrence, or the return of lung cancer, is common. The authors performed an analysis to characterize human lung cancer transcriptomes at single-cell resolution. The transcriptome is the sum total of messenger RNA within the genetic material of an organism. The analysis found a positive correlation (link) between a gene and a chemokine, both with roles in a pro-inflammatory or infection-fighting response, in human lung cancer cells taken from cancer patients. Chemokines are signaling proteins that attract white blood cells to infection sites. Furthermore, the authors discovered an inverse (opposite) correlation between chemokine messenger RNAs and microRNAs in human lung cancer cells taken from cancer patients. MicroRNA is RNA that is not translated into functioning proteins. Specially, one microRNA (miR-532-5p) was measurable in plasma from the cells. The authors identified markers of early-stage lung cancer that were validated (proven) in primary lung tumors and circulating blood.",
19,33165964,"Background: No clinical trials have been specifically designed to compare medical treatments after surgery in Parkinson's disease (PD). Objective: Study's objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of levodopa versus dopamine agonist monotherapy after deep brain stimulation (DBS) in PD. Methods: Thirty-five surgical candidates were randomly assigned to receive postoperative monotherapy with either levodopa or dopamine agonist in a randomized, single-blind study. All patients were reevaluated in short- (3 months), mid- (6 months), and long-term (2.5 years) follow-up after surgery. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) 3 months after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were the percentage of patients maintaining monotherapy, change in motor symptoms, and specific non-motor symptoms (NMS). Analysis was performed primarily in the intention-to-treat population. Results: Randomization did not significantly affect the primary outcome (difference in NMSS between treatment groups was 4.88 [95% confidence interval: -11.78-21.53, P = 0.566]). In short- and mid-term follow-up, monotherapy was safe and feasible in more than half of patients (60% in short- and 51.5% in mid-term follow-up), but it was more often possible for patients on levodopa. The ability to maintain dopamine agonist monotherapy was related to optimal contact location. In the long term, levodopa monotherapy was feasible only in a minority of patients (34.2%), whereas dopamine agonist monotherapy was not tolerated due to worsening of motor conditions or occurrence of impulse control disorders. Conclusions: This trial provides evidence for simplifying pharmacological treatment after functional neurosurgery for PD. The reduction in dopamine receptor agonists should be attempted while monitoring for occurrence of NMSs, such as apathy and sleep disturbances.","No clinical trials with patients have been developed to compare medical treatments after surgery in Parkinson's disease (a brain disorder that affects movement and coordination). The objective of this study is to compare the performance and safety of levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) versus dopamine agonist (a drug that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body) single therapy after deep brain stimulation (surgery that implants devices to stimulate certain areas of the brain) in patients with Parkinson's disease. In this study, 35 patients who are planning to undergo surgery are randomly assigned to receive either levodopa or dopamine agonist after surgery. All patients are evaluated in short (3 months), mid (6 months), and long-term (2.5 years) follow-up appointments after the surgery. The key outcome (result) researchers planned to evaluate is the change in the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale, a scale to count and measure severity of non-motor (unrelated to movement) symptoms such as pain and tiredness, 3 months after surgery. A second outcome is the percent of patients staying on only one drug, change in motor (movement) symptoms, and specific non-motor symptoms. The analysis mainly focuses on the patients who were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment. Being randomly assigned into treatments did not significantly affect the key outcome from the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale between the two treatment groups. In the 3-month and 6-month follow-up appointments, single therapy (only one drug) is safe and practical in more than half of patients, but it was more often possible for patients on levodopa. The ability to maintain dopamine agonist as the only treatment drug is related to the best contact location. In the 2.5 year follow-up, levodopa single therapy is feasible only in a small number of patients, whereas dopamine agonist single therapy is not tolerated (unable to handle side effects) due to worsening of motor conditions or occurrence of impulse control disorders (disorders in which temptations or thoughts cannot be resisted). In conclusion, this study provides evidence for simplifying drug treatment after brain surgery for Parkinson's disease. The reduction in dopamine agonists should be attempted while monitoring for development of non-motor symptoms, such as lack of motivation and sleep disturbances.",
10,24610977,"Background and aims: In previous studies, we successfully applied Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) in patients with non-specific chronic pain of the shoulder joint and lower back. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of LLLT for chronic joint pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers. Subjects and methods: Nine male and 15 female patients with chronic joint pain of the elbow, wrist, or fingers, who were treated at the rehabilitation outpatient clinic at our hospital from April, 2007 to March, 2009 were enrolled in the study. We used a 1000 mW semiconductor laser device. Each tender point and three points around it were irradiated with laser energy. Each point was irradiated twice for 20 s per treatment, giving a total of three minutes for all 4 points. Patients visited the clinic twice a week, and were evaluated after four weeks of treatment. Pain was evaluated with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Statistical analysis of the VAS scores after laser irradiation was performed with Wilcoxon's signed rank sum test, using SPSS Ver.17. Results: All VAS scores were totaled and statistically analyzed. The average VAS score before irradiation was 59.2±12.9, and 33.1±12.2 after the irradiation, showing a significant improvement in VAS score (p<0.001) after treatment. The treatment effect lasted for about one and a half days in the case of wrist pain, epicondylitis lateralis (tennis elbow), and carpal tunnel syndrome. In other pain entities, it lasted for about three to fifteen hours. No change in the range of motion (ROM) was seen in any of the 24 subjects. Conclusion: We concluded that LLLT at the wavelength and parameters used in the present study was effective for chronic pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers.","To treat patients with chronic shoulder and low back pain, previous studies have successfully used a treatment called low level laser therapy (LLLT), a laser light used at a low level and applied to the skin of the body to reduce pain or inflammation and help heal wounds, tissues, and nerves. The purpose of this current study is to find out if LLLT also helps patients with chronic joint pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers. This study included 9 male and 15 female patients with chronic joint pain in the elbow, wrist, or fingers. The tender point (specific area of pain) and three points surrounding the pain were exposed to the LLLT therapy light. Each area was exposed two times for 20 seconds per treatment, giving a total of three minutes for all 4 points. Patients visited the clinic twice a week, and were evaluated after 4 weeks of treatment with LLLT (laser therapy). A tool called the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to measure pain by asking patients to report how intense their pain is on a scale. The study analyzed VAS scores (how patients described their pain) after they received the LLLT laser treatment. All VAS scores that document pain intensity were totaled and analyzed. There was significant improvement in how much pain patients felt after they received the treatment. The effect of the laser treatment lasted for about one and half days for patients with wrist pain, tennis elbow, and carpal tunnel syndrome (pinched nerve in the wrist). In patients with other types of pain, the effect lasted for about 3-15 hours. There was no change in how far patients could move or stretch the injured part of the body after the treatment. This study found that low level laser therapy was helpful for chronic pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers.","In previous studies, we used Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), therapy with applying light on the body's surface, in patients with non-specific, long-lasting pain of the shoulder joint and lower back. This work measures the success of this specific light therapy for lasting joint pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers. Nine male and fifteen female patients with long-lasting joint pain of the elbow, wrist, or fingers were treated at our hospital's recovery clinic from April, 2007 to March, 2009. These patients were employed in the study.  Patients visited the clinic twice a week and were checked after four weeks of treatment. Pain was measured with a specific pain scale.  The average pain score noticeably improved after treatment. The treatment effect lasted for about one and a half days regarding wrist pain, tennis elbow, and carpal tunnel syndrome, which involves pinched nerves in the wrist. In other pain types, the treatment effect lasted for about three to fifteen hours. No change in the range of motion was seen in any of the 24 patients. LLLT at the settings used in this study was useful for long-lasting pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers."
35,15549501,"Osteoporosis and its consequent increase in fracture risk is a major health concern for postmenopausal women and older men and has the potential to reach epidemic proportions. The ""gold standard"" for osteoporosis diagnosis is bone densitometry. However, economic issues or availability of the technology may prevent the possibility of mass screening. The goal of this study was to develop and validate a clinical scoring index designed as a prescreening tool to help clinicians identify which women are at increased risk of osteoporosis [bone mineral density (BMD) T-score -2.5 or less] and should therefore undergo further testing with bone densitometry. Records were analyzed for 1522 postmenopausal females over 50 years of age who had undergone testing with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Osteoporosis risk index scores were compared to bone density T-scores. Hologic QDR 4500 technology was used to measure BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine (L1-L4). Participants who had a previous diagnosis of osteoporosis or were taking bone-active medication were excluded. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to identify the specific cutpoint value that would identify women at increased risk of low BMD. A simple algorithm based on age, weight, history of previous low impact fracture, early menopause, and corticosteroid therapy was developed. Validation of this five-item osteoporosis prescreening risk assessment (OPERA) index showed that the tool, at the recommended threshold (or cutoff value) of two, had a sensitivity that ranged from 88.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean: 86.2-91.9%] at the femoral neck to 90% (95% CI for the mean: 86.1-93.1%) at the lumbar spine area. Corresponding specificity values were 60.6 (95% CI for the mean: 57.9-63.3%) and 64.2% (95% CI for the mean: 61.4-66.9%), respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) ranged from 29 at the femoral neck to 39.2% at the lumbar spine, while the corresponding negative predictive values (NPVs) reached 96.5 and 96.2%, respectively. Based on this cutoff value, the area under the ROC curve was 0.866 (95% CI for the mean: 0.847-0.882) for the lumbar spine and 0.814 (95% CI for the mean: 0.793-0.833) for the femoral neck. We conclude that the OPERA is a free and effective method for identifying Italian postmenopausal women at increased risk of osteoporosis. Its use could facilitate the appropriate and more cost-effective use of bone densitometry in developing countries.","Osteoporosis, a condition in which bones become weak and brittle, and the increase in the risk of bone breaks it causes has worried women who have gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) and older men and could become a huge problem. The best way to diagnose osteoporosis is bone densitometry, a common test to measure bone density. Large-scale checks may not be possible due to economic issues or availability of densitometry. We aimed to make and test a scoring system to help doctors find which women are more likely to develop osteoporosis and should have more testing with bone densitometry. We looked at records for 1522 women who have gone through menopause over 50 years old who had dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA - a common test for bone density). We compared risk scores to bone density tests. We measured BMD at the hip and lower spine. We excluded people who were previously diagnosed with osteoporosis or were taking drugs affecting bones. We came up with a simple calculation based on age, weight, history of previous falls from a standing height or lower, early menopause, and use of a certain kind of steroid. Testing of this five-item osteoporosis prescreening risk assessment (OPERA) shows high accuracy for osteoporosis detection. OPERA shows high accuracy for no detection. The accuracy for results detecting osteoporosis ranged from 29 at the femoral neck to 39.2% at the lumbar spine, while the corresponding accuracy for results not detecting osteoporosis reached 96.5 and 96.2%, respectively. We conclude that the OPERA is a free and effective way to identify Italian women who have gone through menopause at higher risk of osteoporosis. Use of OPERA could help the appropriate and more cost-effective use of bone densitometry in developing countries.",

27,33378609,"Background: Vaccines are needed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to protect persons who are at high risk for complications. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19. Methods: This phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 99 centers across the United States. Persons at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 μg) or placebo 28 days apart. The primary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Results: The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and analyses in participants 65 years of age or older. Severe Covid-19 occurred in 30 participants, with one fatality; all 30 were in the placebo group. Moderate, transient reactogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the mRNA-1273 group. Serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups. Conclusions: The mRNA-1273 vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing Covid-19 illness, including severe disease. Aside from transient local and systemic reactions, no safety concerns were identified.

The mRNA-1273 vaccine helps the body make proteins that will strengthen the immune system to fight the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The 3rd phase of a clinical study is conducted in 99 centers across the United States. People who are at a high risk for the coronavirus or its complications are randomly placed in either the group to receive two shots of the mRNA-1273 vaccine or in the placebo group (people will be given a shot of an inactive substance). The main result researchers are interested in is the prevention of Covid-19 starting at least 14 days after the second shot in study participants who have not already been infected with coronavirus. The trial includes 30,420 volunteers who are randomly placed in a group to receive the vaccine or to receive the placebo. More than 96% of volunteer participants receive both shots, and 2.2% are positive for (or have) the coronavirus at the start of the study. Covid-19 is found in 185 participants in the placebo group and in 11 people in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group. The effectiveness of the vaccine is 94.1%. In additional analyses, the vaccine is found to be effective during the patient evaluation 14 days after the first dose, in participants who were positive for coronavirus at the start of the study, and in participants 65 years old or older. Serious Covid-19 occurs in 30 participants, with one death. All 30 are in the placebo group. Moderate, short-lasting side effects after vaccination occur more often in the mRNA-1273 vaccination group. Serious side effects are rare, and the number of times it occurred is similar in the two groups.

32,31932513,"Objective: We evaluated the interaction of serum folate and vitamin B12 with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotypes on the risk of first ischemic stroke and on the efficacy of folic acid treatment in prevention of first ischemic stroke. Methods: A total of 20,702 hypertensive adults were randomized to a double-blind treatment of daily enalapril 10 mg and folic acid 0.8 mg or enalapril 10 mg alone. Participants were followed up every 3 months. Results: Median values of folate and B12 concentrations at baseline were 8.1 ng/mL and 280.2 pmol/L, respectively. Over a median of 4.5 years, among those not receiving folic acid, participants with baseline serum B12 or serum folate above the median had a significantly lower risk of first ischemic stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.96), especially in those with MTHFR 677 CC genotype (wild-type) (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31-0.78). Folic acid treatment significantly reduced the risk of first ischemic stroke in participants with both folate and B12 below the median (2.3% in enalapril-folic acid group vs 3.6% in enalapril-only group; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46-0.86), particularly in MTHFR 677 CC carriers (1.6% vs 4.9%; HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.11-0.55). However, TT homozygotes responded better with both folate and B12 levels above the median (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.75). Conclusions: The risk of first ischemic stroke was significantly higher in hypertensive patients with low levels of both folate and B12. Effect of folic acid treatment was greatest in patients with low folate and B12 with the CC genotype, and with high folate and B12 with the TT genotype.","We checked the interaction of blood folate, a B-vitamin, and vitamin B12 with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C6677T genotypes, or specific DNA sequences in humans encoding the same protein. This was done to measure the risk of first ischemic stroke, or blood clotting that would block brain blood flow, and success of folic acid treatment to prevent this stroke. 20,702 adults with high blood pressure randomly received either 10 mg of daily blood pressure medication and 0.8 mg of folic acid or 10 mg of blood pressure alone. Participants were checked every 3 months. Average folate and B12 levels at start were 8.1 ng/mL and 280.2 pmol/L, respectively. Over around 4.5 years, among those not receiving folid acid, participants with starting blood B12 or blood folate above the average had much lower risk of first ischemic stroke, especially those with the standard MTHFR C6677T genotype. Folic acid treatment reduced the risk of first ischemic stroke in participants with both folate and B12 below the average, especially in those with the altered MTHFR genotype. However, those with certain MTHFR genotypes responded with both folate and B12 levels above the average. The risk of first ischemic stroke was higher in patients with high blood pressure and low levels of folate and B12. Folic acid treatment had the most effect in patients with low folate and B12 with a certain MTHFR genotype, and with high folate and B12 with another genotype.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the interaction of serumor blood folate (a specific vitamin) and vitamin B12 with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR- a gene) C677T genotypes, or inherited gene types for a protein involved in blood pressure, on the risk of first ischemic or brain-related stroke. Genotypes are variations of a gene. These variations are often referred to as TT, CC, or CT. Additionally, the study aimed to review the efficacy or success of folic acid treatment in prevention of first ischemic stroke. A total of 20,702 hypertensive (high blood pressure) adults were randomly placed into one of two treatment groups: daily enalapril (common blood pressure medication) 10 mg and folic acid 0.8 mg or enalapril 10 mg alone. Participants were followed up every 3 months. Average values of folate and B12 concentrations before treatment were 8.1 ng/mL and 280.2 pmol/L, respectively. Over an average of 4.5 years, participants not receiving folic acid with baseline (starting) serum or blood B12 or serum folate above the median (average) had a significantly lower risk of first ischemic stroke. This decreased risk was found especially in those with MTHFR 677 CC genotype (wild-type or normal). Folic acid treatment significantly reduced the risk of first ischemic stroke in participants with both folate and B12 below the median, particularly in patients with CC genotype. However, participants with TT genotype responded better with both folate and B12 levels above the median of participants. The study concluded the risk of first ischemic stroke was significantly higher in hypertensive patients with low levels of both folate and B12.

25,34552950,"Over 80 mAbs have been shown to block the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 S1 glycoprotein and its cellular receptor, thus neutralizing virus infectivity in vitro. Some of those mAbs demonstrate therapeutic efficacy to curtail viral burden and lung inflammation in animal models. The neutralization mechanisms of mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo are not fully understood, but optimal protection correlates with Fc effector functions. Approximately 30 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing m Abs are undergoing clinical trials in COVID-19 patients. Some were granted emergency authorization since they reduced viral load, disease severity, and hospitalization in randomized, controlled phase II clinical trials. However, mAbs are unaffordable for healthcare systems in many developing countries due to their high cost (> USD 1,500/vial), meaning that most infected people would not have access to them. Another obstacle for COVID-19 therapy with mAbs is the emergence of viral variants harboring changes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 glycoprotein. The variants of concern (VoC) exhibit enhanced transmissibility or virulence, circulate worldwide, and include those designated as alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma, and delta, first detected in the UK, South Africa, Brazil, USA, and India, respectively. Therapeutic mAbs, and antibodies in the plasma of vaccinated or convalescent individuals, fail to neutralize VoC efficiently.","Over 80 monoclonal antibody medicines have been shown to block the interaction between the coronavirus glycoprotein (a molecule that has a carbohydrate and a protein) and its cell receptor that can send signals, resulting in making the virus ineffective. The coronavirus causes COVID-1, a viral breathing-related disorder, and monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells. Some of those monoclonal antibodies show that they work well to reduce the effects of the virus and lung inflammation (redness and swelling in response to infection) in animal studies. The process used by monoclonal antibodies to make the virus ineffective in humans and animals is not fully understood, but the best protection is associated with the Fc effector functions, which are the part of the antibody that interacts with other cells. Approximately 30 monoclonal antibodies are currently being tested in clinical trials in COVID-19 patients. Some are granted emergency authorization (where unapproved medicines may be used) because they reduce the amount of virus in the body, lessen the seriousness of the disease, and reduce hospital stays in clinical trials. However, monoclonal antibodies are expensive for healthcare systems in many developing countries, meaning that most infected people would not have access to the medicine. Another challenge for COVID-19 medicines that use monoclonal antibodies is the new variants that change cell receptor activity for the glycoprotein. The variants of concern are more easily transmitted between people, are found worldwide, and include those designated as alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma, and delta. Monoclonal antibody medicines, and antibodies in plasma (the liquid portion of blood) of vaccinated or recovering people, fail to efficiently make the variants of interest ineffective.",

However, there are no data in elderly nursing home (NH) patients to evaluate gabapentin absorption and elimination. Our objective was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of GBP in elderly nursing home patients maintained on GBP therapy. This was a prospective pharmacokinetic study in elderly nursing home patients (≥60 years) receiving GBP for the management of chronic pain or epilepsy from seven nursing homes. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. A one-compartment model described the data and clearance (CL) was associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p < 0.0001). The GBP CL in elderly nursing home patients was 2.93 L/h. After adjusting for the effect of GFR, GBP CL was not affected by age, sex, body weight, or comorbidity scores. No significant effects of body size measures, age, and sex were detected on volume of distribution. Dose-dependent bioavailability of GBP was demonstrated, and the saturable absorption profile was described by a nonlinear hyperbolic function. Prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pc-VPC) suggests adequate fixed- and random-effects models that successfully simulated the mean trend and variability in gabapentin concentration-time profiles. In this analysis, the parameters of the hyperbolic nonlinearity appear to be similar between elderly and younger adults.","Data on how gabapentin (GBP -a nerve-related pain medication) is used in the body in elderly patients show a major effect of older age on how the drug works due to changes in kidney function. However, there are no data in elderly nursing home patients to evaluate how the body absorbs and removes gabapentin. The objective of this study is to describe how the body uses and processes gabapentin in elderly nursing home patients who are on gabapentin. This study observed elderly nursing home patients (≥60 years) receiving gabapentin for chronic (ongoing) pain or epilepsy (seizure disorders) from 7 nursing homes. Data on gabapentin and the clearance of the drug are associated with the rate that measures how well the kidneys are working. The gabapentin clearance in elderly nursing home patients was 2.93 liters per hour. After accounting for the rate that measures how well the kidneys are working, GBP clearance is not affected by age, sex, body weight, or other illnesses and their medications. No significant effects of body size measures, age, and sex are detected on volume of distribution, the ability of various drugs to distribute through the body fluids. The availability of the drug being dependent on dosage is shown, and how it is absorbed is calculated. Additional calculations are done on the entire group to evaluate the performance of the drug and identify other individual factors that may impact the effect.

53,12713453,"Background: In diabetic patients, postprandial glucose levels, which have a major impact on metabolic control, are determined by the rate of nutrient delivery into the intestine, absorption of nutrients from the small intestine, and the metabolism of the absorbed nutrients by the liver. The present study addresses whether Type 1 diabetic patients have increased intestinal permeability and intestinal permeability predicts postprandial glucose variability. Material and methods: Thirty Type 1 diabetic patients together with 15 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. After an overnight fasting all patients and controls received 100 micro Ci 51 Cr of EDTA as a radioactive tracer and the percentage of the isotope excreted in a 24-h urinary specimen was the permeability measure. Instant blood glucose was measured just before the test, and the patients performed and recorded self-monitoring of fasting and 2nd-hour postprandial blood glucose levels during the following week. Results: We found that intestinal permeability is increased in Type 1 diabetic patients compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Increased intestinal permeability is related at least in part to the instant blood glucose level and the presence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Conclusion: Increased intestinal permeability leads to higher variation in postprandial blood glucose levels, thereby worsening metabolic control.","In diabetic patients, blood sugar levels after meals, which have a major impact on how nutrients in the body are used, are determined by several factors: the rate of nutrient delivery into the stomach, absorption of nutrients from the small intestine that helps further digestion of food, and the metabolism of the nutrients absorbed by the liver. The present study addresses whether Type 1 diabetic patients have increased intestinal permeability, the control of material passing from the stomach and to the rest of the body, and how intestinal permeability predicts different levels of blood sugar after meals. Thirty Type 1 diabetic patients and 15 healthy people as controls (comparison group) are enrolled in the study. After an overnight fasting (no food), all patients and controls receive a substance called EDTA that allows internal images of the body to be seen, and the amount of the substance released in a 24-hour urine sample is how intestinal permeability is measured. During the following week, instant blood sugar is measured just before the test, and the patients performed and recorded self-monitoring of fasting and blood sugar levels 2 hours after meals. Researchers found that intestinal permeability is increased in Type 1 diabetic patients compared with healthy controls. Increased intestinal permeability is related at least in part to the instant blood sugar level and the presence of a type of nerve damage that can occur with diabetes. Increased intestinal permeability that allows substances to pass from the stomach to the body leads to higher differences in post-meal blood sugar levels, thereby worsening the body's ability to control the use and distribution of nutrients.",

34,23636234,"Protein-energy wasting (PEW), characterized by a decline in body protein mass and energy reserves, including muscle and fat wasting and visceral protein pool contraction, is an underappreciated condition in early to moderate stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a strong predictor of adverse outcomes. The prevalence of PEW in early to moderate CKD is ≥20-25% and increases as CKD progresses, in part because of activation of proinflammatory cytokines combined with superimposed hypercatabolic states and declines in appetite. This anorexia leads to inadequate protein and energy intake, which may be reinforced by prescribed dietary restrictions and inadequate monitoring of the patient's nutritional status. Worsening uremia also renders CKD patients vulnerable to potentially deleterious effects of uncontrolled diets, including higher phosphorus and potassium burden. Uremic metabolites, some of which are anorexigenic and many of which are products of protein metabolism, can exert harmful effects, ranging from oxidative stress to endothelial dysfunction, nitric oxide disarrays, renal interstitial fibrosis, sarcopenia, and worsening proteinuria and kidney function. Given such complex pathways, nutritional interventions in CKD, when applied in concert with nonnutritional therapeutic approaches, encompass an array of strategies (such as dietary restrictions and supplementations) aimed at optimizing both patients' biochemical variables and their clinical outcomes. The applicability of many nutritional interventions and their effects on outcomes in patients with CKD with PEW has not been well studied. This article reviews the definitions and pathophysiology of PEW in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, examines the current indications for various dietary modification strategies in patients with CKD (eg, manufactured protein-based supplements, amino acids and their keto acid or hydroxyacid analogues), discusses the rationale behind their potential use in patients with PEW, and highlights areas in need of further research.","Protein-energy wasting is a decline in the amount of protein in the body and leads to less stored energy. It is a condition present in early to moderate stages of chronic kidney disease and a signal that negative health outcomes may occur. Protein-energy wasting often increases as chronic kidney disease gets worse, in part because of more inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) combined with too much breakdown of proteins and loss of appetite. This leads to not enough proteins and energy, which may be held up by dietary restrictions from doctors and not enough monitoring of how the patient's nutrition impacts their health. Worsening uremia, which is when there is too much waste in the blood, may make uncontrolled diets have a negative impact on chronic disease patients. Too many waste products in the blood that would normally be removed by urine can have harmful effects, including an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants in the body (which can lead to cell and tissue damage), endothelial dysfunction which is damaged functioning of the lining of blood vessels impacting the heart, and other conditions. Nutritional interventions (changing diet and diet behavior to reach a health goal) in chronic kidney disease, when combined with other therapies unrelated to nutrition, create a number of strategies aimed at improving the internal systems of the body in the patient and the patient's health outcomes. How nutritional interventions can work and their effects on patients with chronic kidney disease with protein-energy wasting is not well studied. This article reviews the definitions and the process of protein-energy wasting in patients with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis, and examines when changes in the diet is appropriate and areas that need further research.",
48,34605394,"Objective: To determine the relative effectiveness and safety of belimumab and anifrolumab in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Materials and methods: A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness and safety of belimumab 10 mg, anifrolumab 300 mg, and a placebo in patients with active SLE. Results: Six RCTs (2,757 patients) were included in this study. The response rate based on the SLE 4 Responder Index (SRI4) at 52 weeks was substantially higher in the belimumab 10-mg and anifrolumab 300-mg groups than that in the placebo group (OR 2.90, % credible intervals (CrIs) 2.37 - 3.56; OR 1.60, % CrI 1.22 - 2.08). The SRI4 response rate for belimumab 10 mg was significantly higher than that for anifrolumab 300 mg (OR 1.82, 95% CrI 1.30 - 2.53).

30,33113040,"Many studies have shown that re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in recovered COVID-19 patients are very common. We aim to conduct this review to summarize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these patients and discuss the potential explanations for recurrences, the contagiousness of re-detectable positive SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the management of COVID-19 patients after discharge from hospital. The proportion of re-positive tests in discharged COVID-19 patients varied from 2.4 to 69.2% and persisted from 1 to 38 days after discharge, depending on population size, age of patients, and type of specimens. Currently, several causes of re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 patients are suggested, including false-negative, false-positive RT-PCR tests; reactivation; and re-infection with SARS-CoV-2, but the mechanism leading to these re-positive cases is still unclear. The prevention of re-positive testing in discharged patients is a fundamental measure to control the spread of the pandemic. In order to reduce the percentage of false-negative tests prior to discharge, we recommend performing more than two tests, according to the standard sampling and microbiological assay protocol. In addition, specimens should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA before discharge. Further studies should be conducted to develop novel assays that target a crucial region of the RNA genome in order to improve its sensitivity and specificity.","Many studies have shown that testing positive again for (or having) coronavirus in recovered Covid-19 patients (patients recovered from the serious viral, lung infection of Covid-19) is very common. This study aims to summarize medical and other key characteristics of these patients.

The percentage who re-tested as positive in discharged Covid-19 patients is between 2.4 to 69.2%. Retesting as positive continued from 1 to 38 days after discharge, or release, from the hospital, depending on population size, age, and the type of samples used to test. Currently, several causes of re-positive tests for coronavirus in recovered Covid-19 patients are suggested, including incorrect negative or positive test results; reactivation (when someone appears to have recovered but still has traces of the virus in the body); and being re-infected with coronavirus, but the process leading to these re-positive tests is still unclear. Preventing patients who have recovered and are sent home from testing positive again is an important step to control the spread of the pandemic. To limit the number of false-negatives tests (when a person tests negative but are actually positive for the virus) before being sent home, study researchers suggest doing more than 2 tests. In addition, samples should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify coronavirus DNA before discharge from the hospital.

19,32710141,"Purpose: To investigate the comparative effectiveness of dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase type-B (MAO-B) inhibitors available for treatment of Parkinson's disease. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search identifying randomized controlled trials investigating 4 dopamine agonists (cabergoline, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) and 3 MAO-B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline, safinamide) for Parkinson's disease. We extracted and pooled data from included clinical trials in a joint model allowing both direct and indirect comparison of the seven drugs. We considered dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors given as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa. Selected endpoints were change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, serious adverse events and withdrawals. We estimated the relative effectiveness of each dopamine agonist and MAO-B inhibitor versus comparator drug. Results: Altogether, 79 publications were included in the analysis. We found all the investigated drugs to be effective compared with placebo when given as monotherapy except safinamide. When considering combination treatment, the estimated relative effects of selegiline, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine, cabergoline, rasagiline and safinamide were 2.316 (1.819, 2.951), 2.091 (1.889, 2.317), 2.037 (1.804, 2.294), 1.912 (1.716, 2.129), 1.664 (1.113, 2.418), 1.584 (1.379, 1.820) and 1.179 (1.031, 1.352), respectively, compared with joint placebo and levodopa treatment. Conclusions: Dopamine agonists were found to be effective as treatment for Parkinson's disease, both when given as monotherapy and in combination with levodopa. Selegiline and rasagiline were also found to be effective for treating Parkinson's disease, and selegiline was the best option in combination with levodopa among all the drugs investigated.","The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of dopamine agonists (medication that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body to relieve symptoms related to low levels of dopamine) and monoamine oxidase type-B (MAO-B) inhibitors (medications that prevent enzymes in the body from breaking down dopamine which allows more dopamine available in the brain) for Parkinson's disease.

28,34562551,"Some COVID-19 patients suffer complications from anti-viral immune responses which can lead to both a dangerous cytokine storm and development of blood-borne factors that render severe thrombotic events more likely. The precise immune response profile is likely, therefore, to determine and predict patient outcomes and also represents a target for intervention. Anti-viral T cell exhaustion in the early stages is associated with disease progression. Dysregulation of T cell functions, which precedes cytokine storm development and neutrophil expansion in alveolar tissues heralds damaging pathology. T cell function, cytokine production and factors that attract neutrophils to the lung can be modified through targeting molecules that can modulate T cell responses. Manipulating T cell responses by targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway could provide the means to control the immune response in COVID-19 patients. During the initial anti-viral response, T cell effector function can be enhanced by delaying anti-viral exhaustion through inhibiting PI3K and Akt. Additionally, immune dysregulation can be addressed by enhancing immune suppressor functions by targeting downstream mTOR, an important intracellular modulator of cellular metabolism. Targeting this signalling pathway also has potential to prevent formation of thrombi due to its role in platelet activation. Furthermore, this signalling pathway is essential for SARS-cov-2 virus replication in host cells and its inhibition could, therefore, reduce viral load. The ultimate goal is to identify targets that can quickly control the immune response in COVID-19 patients to improve patient outcome. Targeting different levels of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway could potentially achieve this during each stage of the disease.","Some patients of COVID-19 (a respiratory viral illness) suffer issues from anti-viral immune responses. These can lead to a dangerous inflammatory molecule overproduction and blood-borne substances that increase blood clotting risk. The exact immune response type may determine and predict patient outcomes. It may also be a target for treatment. Elimination of specific anti-viral immune cells called T cells in the early stages is linked with disease progression. Damaged T cell function, which is before inflammatory molecule overproduction and expansion in lungs, signals harmful disease effects. T cell function, inflammatory molecule production and attraction to the lung can be changed by targeting molecules that can alter responses of specific immune cells. Changing T cell responses by targeting a specific pathway may help control the immune response in COVID-19 patients. During initial anti-viral response, specific T cell function can be improved by delaying anti-viral elimination by blocking a specific cell pathway. Also, immune system impairment can be addressed by improving functions to suppress the immune response. This can be done by targeting a specific molecule that influences cellular metabolism. Targeting this specific cell signaling pathway may prevent blood clotting. Also, this cellular pathway is needed for the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Blocking the pathway could reduce virus amount. The end goal is to identify targets that can quickly control the immune response in COVID-19 patients to improve patient outcome. Targeting different parts of a specific cellular pathway could achieve this immune response control at each stage of the disease.","Some patients suffer complications from anti-viral immune responses, or the response their body creates when infected with a virus. These complications can lead to both a dangerous cytokine storm (proteins that control activity of immune and blood cells that flood the body) and development of blood-borne factors that increase the likelihood of blood clots or scabs. Each person's unique immune response will likely determine and predict how a patient will react to infection. Therefore, each person's immune system represents a target for intervention to prevent harmful side effects. In the early stages of infection, exhausted or overworked T cells (an immune system cell) can lead to disease progression. Alteration of T cell functions often comes before a cytokine storm and neutrophil expansion, or the suppression of immune system. When these events occur in lung tissues, diseases are often even more damaging. T cell function, cytokine production, and events that attract neutrophils (cells that sweep humans for signs of infection) to the lung can be changed by specifically targeting molecules that trigger T cell responses. Manipulating T cell responses could provide the means to control the immune response in patients with COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disorder). During the initial anti-viral response, T cell function can be enhanced by delaying anti-viral exhaustion by suppressing certain biological pathways. Additionally, immune dysregulation or errors can be addressed by enhancing immune suppressor functions by targeting molecules that control cell metabolism. Targeting cell metabolism pathways may also prevent formation of blood clots. Furthermore, the cell metabolism pathway is needed for COVID-19 replication in host cells. Suppressing the pathway could potentially decrease the amount of virus within the host. The overall goal is to identify biological targets than can control the immune response in COVID-19 patients to improve patient well-being. Targeting specific pathways in the body could achieve this goal during each stage of the disease."
42,27924077,"Eight types of short-chain Lys acylations have recently been identified on histones: propionylation, butyrylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, succinylation, malonylation, glutarylation, crotonylation and β-hydroxybutyrylation. Emerging evidence suggests that these histone modifications affect gene expression and are structurally and functionally different from the widely studied histone Lys acetylation. In this Review, we discuss the regulation of non-acetyl histone acylation by enzymatic and metabolic mechanisms, the acylation 'reader' proteins that mediate the effects of different acylations and their physiological functions, which include signal-dependent gene activation, spermatogenesis, tissue injury and metabolic stress. We propose a model to explain our present understanding of how differential histone acylation is regulated by the metabolism of the different acyl-CoA forms, which in turn modulates the regulation of gene expression.","Acylations are parts of molecules that help groups of atoms called acyl groups connect to compounds in the body. Eight acylations are recently identified on histones, which are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome (DNA) and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. These 8 types are called propionylation, butyrylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, succinylation, malonylation, glutarylation, crotonylation and β-hydroxybutyrylation. New evidence suggests that these histone changes affect how information from genes are used to build proteins or other molecules. These histones are also built different and have different functions from other common histones. In this review, researchers discuss how some histones are regulated in the body and how some acylation proteins bring about the effects of other acylations and their functions. Researchers develop a model to explain their understanding of how different histone acylations is regulated by metabolism (digestion) of other enzymes, which then adjust the regulation of genes.",

47,34213743,"Purpose: The study aimed to define the clinical, biochemical and genetic features of adult patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis and/or bone fragility and low serum alkaline phosphatase (sALP). Methods: Twenty-two patients with at least two sALP values below the reference range were retrospectively enrolled after exclusion of secondary causes. Data about clinical features, mineral and bone markers, serum pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA), lumbar and femur bone densitometry, and column X-ray were collected. Peripheral blood DNA of each participant was analyzed to detect ALPL gene anomalies. Results: Pathogenic ALPL variants (pALPL) occurred in 23% and benign variants in 36% of patients (bALPL), while nine patients harbored wild-type alleles (wtALPL). Fragility fractures and dental anomalies were more frequent in patients harboring pALPL and bALPL than in wtALPL patients. Of note, wtALPL patients comprised women treated with tamoxifen for hormone-sensitive breast cancer. Mineral and bone markers were similar in the three groups. Mean urine PEA levels were significantly higher in patients harboring pALPL than those detected in patients harboring bALPL and wtALPL; by contrast, serum PLP levels were similar in the three groups. A 6-points score, considering clinical and biochemical features, was predictive of pALPL detection [P = 0.060, OR 1.92 (95% CI 0.972, 3.794)], and more significantly of pALPL or bALPL [P = 0.025, OR 14.33 (95% CI 1.401, 14.605)]. Conclusion: In osteopenic/osteoporotic patients, single clinical or biochemical factors did not distinguish hypophosphatasemic patients harboring pALPL or bALPL from those harboring wtALPL. Occurrence of multiple clinical and biochemical features is predictive of ALPL anomalies, and, therefore, they should be carefully identified.

These variants include pathogenic (harmful) ALPL variants (pALPL), benign (harmless) variants (bALPL), and wild-type (normal) variants (wtALPL). pALPL are variants that increases a person's chance to get sick from a disease. bALPL are mutations that do not impact human health. wtALPL variants are genes that are not mutated or changed in form. Bone and tooth damage were more frequent in patients harboring pALPL and bALPL than in wtALPL patients. Of note, wtALPL patients comprised women treated with tamoxifen, a drug for breast cancer. Mineral and bone markers were similar in the three groups. Average urine phosphoethanolamine, a compound that can indicate bone disease, was significantly higher in patients with pALPL than the other two variant types. By contrast, serum pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, an indicator of vitamin B6 volume, was similar in the three groups. Certain hospital evaluation techniques were able to predict pALPL and bALPL. In patients with osteoporosis (brittle bones), visible health effects and biological compound indicators do not distinguish hypophosphatasemia (low serum ALP) patients harboring pALPL or bALPL variants from those harboring wtALPL. However, visible health effects and biological compound indicators can be predictive of ALPL anomalies. Therefore, they should be carefully identified. Tamoxifen emerged as a drug to treat hypophosphatasemia.",

The two classes of proteins share many features of DNA binding behaviour, although they are structurally unrelated. While the linker histones and HMG1/2 exhibit direct competition in binding to such structures as four-way junction DNA, whether they compete for binding to the nucleosome has not been investigated. The possibility for either opposite or synergistic effects on gene regulation must be considered at this point.","Linker histones are proteins that play a major role in organizing DNA and proteins to create the nucleus (chamber holding the DNA) inside cells and how instructions from genes are used.

The two types of proteins attach to DNA is similar ways, although they are different in how they structured. Whether linker histones and non-histone proteins compete for binding (attaching) to the nucleosome (a section of DNA that is wrapped around a core of proteins) has not been investigated. The possibility for either opposite or cooperative effects on regulating genes must be considered at this point.",
6,27852303,"Background: Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder and the most common cause of hypothyroidism. The use of Nigella sativa, a potent herbal medicine, continues to increase worldwide as an alternative treatment of several chronic diseases including hyperlipidemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of Nigella sativa on thyroid function, serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) - 1, Nesfatin-1 and anthropometric features in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Methods: Forty patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, aged between 22 and 50 years old, participated in the trial and were randomly allocated into two groups of intervention and control receiving powdered Nigella sativa or placebo daily for 8 weeks. Changes in anthropometric variables, dietary intakes, thyroid status, serum VEGF and Nesfatin-1 concentrations after 8 weeks were measured. Results: Treatment with Nigella sativa significantly reduced body weight and body mass index (BMI). Serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies decreased while serum T3 concentrations increased in Nigella sativa-treated group after 8 weeks. There was a significant reduction in serum VEGF concentrations in intervention group. None of these changes had been observed in placebo treated group. In stepwise multiple regression model, changes in waist to hip ratio (WHR) and thyroid hormones were significant predictors of changes in serum VEGF and Nesgfatin-1 values in Nigella sativa treated group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our data showed a potent beneficial effect of powdered Nigella sativa in improving thyroid status and anthropometric variables in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Moreover, Nigella sativa significantly reduced serum VEGF concentrations in these patients. Considering observed health- promoting effect of this medicinal plant in ameliorating the disease severity, it can be regarded as a useful therapeutic approach in management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.","Hashimoto's thyroiditis is caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells and is the most common cause of an underactive thyroid. More people around the world are taking Nigella sativa, a powerful herbal medicine, as a nontraditional way to treat many long-term diseases including high cholesterol, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. The current study aimed to rate the effects of Nigella sativa on how well the thyroid is working, blood Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) - 1 (a protein that promotes new blood vessels), Nesfatin-1 (a chain of amino acids that affects hunger) and physical body measurements in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. We randomly split forty people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and between 22 and 50 years old into two group and gave one group powdered Nigella sativa and the other group sham treatment for 8 weeks. We measured changes in physical body measurements, what people ate, thyroid function, blood VEGF and Nefastin-1 levels after 8 weeks. Taking Nigella sativa caused lower body weight and body mass index (BMI). People taking Nigella sativa had lower blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and antibodies that target the thyroid and higher levels of blood thyroid hormone (T4) after 8 weeks. People taking Nigella sativa had lower blood levels of VEGF. None of these changes were seen in the group who took the sham treatmentl. Based on a statistical model, changes in the ratio of the waist to the hip and thyroid hormones predicted changes in blood VEGF and Nesgfatin-1 levels in the group who took Nigella sativa. We concluded that powdered Nigella sativa improved thyroid function and physical body measurements in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Nigella sativa lowered blood VEGF levels. Nigella sativa can be a useful non-traditional treatment for people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis to make the disease less severe.","Hashimoto's thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation) occurs when immune cells mistakenly attack the body's own healthy cells. It is the most common cause of reduced thyroid function. Nigella sativa, a powerful herbal medicine, increases globally as an alternative treatment for many long-lasting diseases like high blood pressure, high blood fat, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The current work evaluates how Nigella sativa affects thyroid function, blood protein levels, and physical measurements in those with Hashimoto's thyroid inflammation. Forty patients with Hashimoto's thyroid inflammation, aged 22 through 50, were randomly split into two groups receiving powdered Nigella sativa or inactive treatment daily for 8 weeks. Using an herbal medicine reduced body weight and body mass index. Blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid cell proteins decreased while thyroid product levels increased in the Nigella sative-treated group after 8 weeks. The treatment group showed reduced blood vessel signaling protein. No changes occured in the inactive treatment group. Changes in waist to hip ratio and thyroid hormones were linked to changes in certain blood protein levels in the Nigella sative-treated group. Nigella sativa may improve thyroid and general health in those with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation). Also, Nigella sativa (an herbal medicine) reduces blood vessel signaling protein in these patients. Due to its health-promoting effect, this medicinal plant can be a useful treatment for Hashimoto's thyroidits."

40,21944912,"Objectives: This study was conducted to define bandage pressures that are safe and effective in treating leg ulcers of mixed arterial-venous etiology. Methods: In 25 patients with mixed-etiology leg ulcers who received inelastic bandages applied with pressures from 20 to 30, 31 to 40, and 41 to 50 mm Hg, the following measurements were performed before and after bandage application to ensure patient safety throughout the investigation: laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF) close to the ulcer under the bandage and at the great toe, transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPo(2)) on the dorsum of the foot, and toe pressure. Ejection fraction (EF) of the venous pump was performed to assess efficacy on venous hemodynamics. Results: LDF values under the bandages increased by 33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17-48; P < .01), 28% (95% CI, 12-45; P < .05), and 10% (95% CI, -7 to 28), respectively, under the three pressure ranges applied. At toe level, a significant decrease in flux of -20% (95% CI, -48 to 9; P < .05) was seen when bandage pressure >41 mm Hg. Toe pressure values and TcPo(2) showed a moderate increase, excluding a restriction to arterial perfusion induced by the bandages. Inelastic bandages were highly efficient in improving venous pumping function, increasing the reduced ejection fraction by 72% (95% CI, 50%-95%; P < .001) under pressure of 21 to 30 mm Hg and by 103% (95% CI, 70%-128%; P < .001) at 31 to 40 mm Hg. Conclusions: In patients with mixed ulceration, an ankle-brachial pressure index >0.5 and an absolute ankle pressure of >60 mm Hg, inelastic compression of up to 40 mm Hg does not impede arterial perfusion but may lead to a normalization of the highly reduced venous pumping function. Such bandages are therefore recommended in combination with walking exercises as the basic conservative management for patients with mixed leg ulcers.","This study was conducted to find what bandage pressures are safe and effective in treating leg ulcers (leg sores) caused by various vein disorders. The study evaluated 25 patients with leg ulcers who received inelastic bandages applied with various pressures (20 to 30, 31 to 40, and 41 to 50 mm Hg). Several measurements were performed before and after bandage application to ensure patient safety throughout the investigation. These measurements included laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF), transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPo(2)), and toe pressure. LDF measures blood flow. TcPO2 measures oxygen in the skin. Ejection fraction (EF) of the venous pump, or the blood flowing from the heart, was performed to assess blood flow from the heart every time it contracts. LDF values under the bandages increased at all three pressure ranges. At toe level, a significant decrease in flux (blood buildup) was seen when bandage pressure was >41 mm Hg. Toe pressure values and TcPo(2) moderately increased. Inelastic bandages were highly efficient in improving venous pumping function. This is when a machine compresses veins to force blood flow to the heart. The study concluded that patients with mixed ulceration using inelastic compression of up to 40 mm Hg do not experience impeded (blocked) arterial perfusion. Arterial perfusion is when a patient has their blood drawn, has the blood mixed with medication, and has the blood pumped back into the host. However, this inelastic compression may lead to a regularly decreased venous pumping function. These bandages are recommended in combination with walking exercises as the basic treatment for patients with mixed leg ulcers.",
43,29939600,"Pacemakers are electronic devices that stimulate the heart with electrical impulses to maintain or restore a normal heartbeat. In 1952, Zoll described an effective means of supporting the patients with intrinsic cardiac pacemaker activity and/or conducting tissue by an artificial, electric, external pacemaker. The pacing of the heart was accomplished by subcutaneous electrodes but could be maintained only for a short period. In 1957, complete heart block was treated using electrodes directly attached to the heart. These early observations instilled the idea that cardiac electrical failure can be controlled. It ultimately led to the development of totally implantable pacemaker by Chardack, Gage, and Greatbatch.

7,27386721,"Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection causes 15% to 30% of sore throats in children and 5% to 15% in adults, and is more common in the late winter and early spring. The strongest independent predictors of GABHS pharyngitis are patient age of five to 15 years, absence of cough, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudates, and fever. To diagnose GABHS pharyngitis, a rapid antigen detection test should be ordered in patients with a modified Centor or FeverPAIN score of 2 or 3. First-line treatment for GABHS pharyngitis includes a 10-day course of penicillin or amoxicillin. Patients allergic to penicillin can be treated with firstgeneration cephalosporins, clindamycin, or macrolide antibiotics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are more effective than acetaminophen and placebo for treatment of fever and pain associated with GABHS pharyngitis; medicated throat lozenges used every two hours are also effective. Corticosteroids provide only a small reduction in the duration of symptoms and should not be used routinely.","Group A strep infection, caused by group A strep bacteria, causes 15% to 30% of sore throats in children and 5% to 15% in adults, and is more common in the late winter and early spring. The most common risk factors of group A strep throat are people under 5 to 15 years old, no cough, tender swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck, white or yellow spots on the tonsils, and fever. To determine if it is Group A strep throat, a rapid strep test, a test using a throat swab to find bacterial fragments in the throat that make you sick, should be used in people with a medium to high score on common sore throat scoring surveys.

9,33448766,"Dysphagia is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, rather than their perceived location, should guide the initial evaluation and imaging. Obstructive symptoms that seem to originate in the throat or neck may actually be caused by distal esophageal lesions. Oropharyngeal dysphagia manifests as difficulty initiating swallowing, coughing, choking, or aspiration, and it is most commonly caused by chronic neurologic conditions such as stroke, Parkinson disease, or dementia. Symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated because of the risk of aspiration. Patients with esophageal dysphagia may report a sensation of food getting stuck after swallowing. This condition is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional esophageal disorders. Eosinophilic esophagitis is triggered by food allergens and is increasingly prevalent; esophageal biopsies should be performed to make the diagnosis. Esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia are relatively rare and may be overdiagnosed. Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction is becoming more common. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for the initial evaluation of esophageal dysphagia, with barium esophagography as an adjunct. Esophageal cancer and other serious conditions have a low prevalence, and testing in low-risk patients may be deferred while a four-week trial of acid-suppressing therapy is undertaken. Many frail older adults with progressive neurologic disease have significant but unrecognized dysphagia, which significantly increases their risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment. In these patients, the diagnosis of dysphagia should prompt a discussion about goals of care before potentially harmful interventions are considered. Speech-language pathologists and other specialists, in collaboration with family physicians, can provide structured assessments and make appropriate recommendations for safe swallowing, palliative care, or rehabilitation.","Trouble swallowing is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, not the area where they are thought to come from, should guide the first exam and visual tests. Symptoms of difficulty breathing that seem to come from the throat or neck may actually be caused by damage in the lower esophagus. Difficulty swallowing that happens in the mouth or the throat shows up as difficulty starting swallowing, coughing, choking, or something entering the airway or lungs by accident. It is most often caused by long-term brain conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's, or memory, language, and thinking loss. Symptoms should be looked at closely due to the risk of something entering the airway or lungs by accident. People with problems that happen during swallowing may describe a feeling of food getting stuck after swallowing. Problems that happen during swallowing is most often caused by stomach-related reflux diseases and disorders of the esophagus with symptoms like heartburn and chest pain. A long-term allergic condition of the esophagus is set off by food allergens and is more and more common. To diagnose this condition, a small part of the esophagus should be removed for examination. Dysfunction of the esophagus that causes difficulty swallowing such as a disorder in which your esophagus is unable to move food and liquids down into your stomach are pretty rare and may be overdiagnosed. Dysfunction of the esophagus caused by opioids is becoming more common. Using a flexible tube with a camera to look at the esophagus, stomach and part of the small intestine is used to look at difficulty swallowing that happens in the mouth and throat, together with barium and X-rays. Cancer of the esophagus and other serious conditions are not common, and low-risk people may take acid reducers for 4 weeks before undergoing testing. Many weak older adults with progressive deterioration in functioning have serious but unseen difficulty swallowing, which really increases their risk of pneumonia (lung infection) caused by something entering the airway or lungs by accident and risk of lacking nutrients in the body. In these people, the diagnosis of difficulty breathing should lead to a conversation about what is important to the person before suggesting possibly harmful treatments. People who treat communication and swallowing disorders and other specialists, working with family doctors, can evaluate and make suggestions for safe swallowing, care for people living with a serious illness, or rehab.",
53,10535452,"The objective of this study was to evaluate whether first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with type 2 diabetes had abnormal circadian insulin secretion and, if so, whether this abnormality affected their glucose metabolism. Six African-American FDRs with normal glucose tolerance and 12 matched normal control subjects (who had no family history of diabetes) were exposed to 48 h of hyperglycemic clamping (approximately 12 mmol/l). Insulin secretion rates (ISRs) were determined by deconvolution of plasma C-peptide levels using individual C-peptide kinetic parameters. Detrending and smoothing of data (z-scores) and computation of autocorrelation functions were used to identify ISR cycles. During the initial hours after start of glucose infusions, ISRs were approximately 60% higher in FDRs than in control subjects (585 vs. 366 nmol/16 h, P < 0.05), while rates of glucose uptake were the same (5.6 mmol x kg(-1) x h(-1)), indicating that the FDRs were insulin resistant. Control subjects had well-defined circadian (24 h) cycles of ISR and plasma insulin that rose in the early morning, peaked in the afternoon, and declined during the night. In contrast, FDRs had several shorter ISR cycles of smaller amplitude that lacked true periodicity. This suggested that the lack of a normal circadian ISR increase had made it impossible for the FDRs to maintain their compensatory insulin hypersecretion beyond 18 h of hyperglycemia. As a result, ISR decreased to the level found in control subjects, and glucose uptake fell below the level of control subjects (61 vs. 117 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.05). In summary, we found that FDRs with normal glucose tolerance had defects in insulin action and secretion. The newly recognized insulin secretory defect consisted of disruption of the normal circadian ISR cycle, which resulted in reduced insulin secretion (and glucose uptake) during the ascending part of the 24 h ISR cycle.","Insulin secretion is the body's release of insulin, the hormone that helps control blood sugar and metabolism. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether first-degree relatives (a person's parent, sibling, or child) of patients with type 2 diabetes have abnormal 24 hour insulin secretion and, if so, whether this abnormality affected their glucose metabolism. Six African-American first-degree relatives with normal blood sugar level and 12 normal control participants (who had no family history of diabetes) were exposed to 48 hours of hyperglycemic clamping, a technique to keep blood sugar levels stable. Insulin secretion rates (ISRs) are determined by calculating plasma C-peptide levels, which are substances that signal if the body is creating insulin. During the initial hours after giving people infusions of sugar (glucose), insulin secretion rates are about 60% higher in first-degree relatives than in the comparison (control) subjects, while rates of sugar uptake are the same. This finding suggests that the first-degree relatives are insulin resistant, which is when the body doesn't respond well to the insulin hormone and can't use blood sugar for energy. Control subjects have well-defined 24 hour cycles of insulin secretion rates and plasma insulin that increase in the early morning, peak in the afternoon, and decline during the night. In contrast, first-degree relatives have several shorter insulin secretion rate cycles. This suggests that the lack of a normal increase in the 24 hour insulin secretion rate makes it impossible for the first-degree relatives to keep their insulin excess secretion beyond 18 hours of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). As a result, insulin secretion rate decreased to the level found in control subjects, and blood sugar uptake fell below the level of control subjects. In summary, researchers found that first-degree relatives with normal blood sugar levels had defects in insulin action and secretion. The new insulin secretory defect includes disrupting the normal 24 hour insulin secretion rate cycle, which resulted in reduced insulin secretion (and blood sugar uptake) during the upward part of the 24 hour insulin secretion rate cycle.",

The remaining 14 patients had chronic dissection, meaning they were treated after more than 2 weeks had passed since pain onset (started). The goals of treatment were to control blood pressure and to attain a negative (no detected) C-reactive protein test result. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). Hospital survival rate in the patients with acute dissection was 96% (27/28). There were several complications that occurred in-hospital during treatment.

6,32001830,"In the 1990s, selenium was identified as a component of an enzyme that activates thyroid hormone; since this discovery, the relevance of selenium to thyroid health has been widely studied. Selenium, known primarily for the antioxidant properties of selenoenzymes, is obtained mainly from meat, seafood and grains. Intake levels vary across the world owing largely to differences in soil content and factors affecting its bioavailability to plants. Adverse health effects have been observed at both extremes of intake, with a narrow optimum range. Epidemiological studies have linked an increased risk of autoimmune thyroiditis, Graves disease and goitre to low selenium status. Trials of selenium supplementation in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis have generally resulted in reduced thyroid autoantibody titre without apparent improvements in the clinical course of the disease. In Graves disease, selenium supplementation might lead to faster remission of hyperthyroidism and improved quality of life and eye involvement in patients with mild thyroid eye disease. Despite recommendations only extending to patients with Graves ophthalmopathy, selenium supplementation is widely used by clinicians for other thyroid phenotypes. Ongoing and future trials might help identify individuals who can benefit from selenium supplementation, based, for instance, on individual selenium status or genetic profile.","In the 1990s, selenium was found to be a part of a protein that helps produce thyroid hormone. Since this discovery, many scientists have studied how selenium might help thyroid health. Selenium, which has antioxidant characteristics, is found in meat, seafood and grains. The amount of selenium eaten varies across the world due to different soils and how much of it plants absorb. Eating too much or too little selenium can cause health problems, with a small ideal range for consumption. Studies that look at how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why show a relationship between eating too little selenium and higher rates of inflamed thyroid caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, Graves disease (a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells and lead to an overactive thyroid), and enlarged thyroids. Studies of people taking selenium who have long-term inflamed thyroids caused by thyroid cells attacked by infection-preventing cells generally have bloodwork that suggests more normal thyroid function but no improvement in symptoms. In Graves disease, taking selenium might make overactive thyroid go away faster and make quality of life and eye problems better in people with mild thyroid eye disease. Although selenium is only recommended for people with thyroid eye disease, doctors prescribe selenium for other thyroid problems. Current and future studies might help determine who should take selenium based, for example, on blood selenium levels and heredity.",

After each EUA, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for vaccine use; currently Pfizer-BioNTech is authorized and recommended for persons aged ≥12 years and Moderna and Janssen for persons aged ≥18 years (1-3). Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, administered as 2-dose series, are mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, whereas the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, administered as a single dose, is a recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus-vector vaccine. As of July 22, 2021, 187 million persons in the United States had received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine (4); close monitoring of safety surveillance has demonstrated that serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are rare (5,6). Three medical conditions have been reported in temporal association with receipt of COVID-19 vaccines. Two of these (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome [TTS], a rare syndrome characterized by venous or arterial thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, and Guillain-Barré syndrome [GBS], a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder characterized by ascending weakness and paralysis) have been reported after Janssen COVID-19 vaccination. One (myocarditis, cardiac inflammation) has been reported after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination, particularly after the second dose; these were reviewed together and will hereafter be referred to as mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. ACIP has met three times to review the data associated with these reports of serious adverse events and has comprehensively assessed the benefits and risks associated with receipt of these vaccines. During the most recent meeting in July 2021, ACIP determined that, overall, the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality outweigh the risks for these rare serious adverse events in adults aged ≥18 years; this balance of benefits and risks varied by age and sex. ACIP continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination in all persons aged ≥12 years. CDC and FDA continue to closely monitor reports of serious adverse events and will present any additional data to ACIP for consideration.

33,33118231,"Aims: Gabapentin (GBP) is widely used to treat neuropathic pain, including diabetic neuropathic pain. Our objective was to evaluate the role of diabetes and glycaemic control on GBP population pharmacokinetics. Methods: A clinical trial was conducted in patients with neuropathic pain (n = 29) due to type 2 diabetes (n = 19) or lumbar/cervical disc herniation (n = 10). All participants were treated with a single oral dose GBP. Blood was sampled up to 24 hours after GBP administration. Data were analysed with a population approach using the stochastic approximation expectation maximization algorithm. Weight, body mass index, sex, biomarkers of renal function and diabetes, and genotypes for the main genetic polymorphisms of SLC22A2 (rs316019) and SLC22A4 (rs1050152), the genes encoding the transporters for organic cations OCT2 and OCTN1, were tested as potential covariates. Results: GBP drug disposition was described by a 1-compartment model with lag-time, first-order absorption and linear elimination. The total clearance was dependent on estimated glomerular filtration rate. Population estimates (between-subject variability in percentage) for lag time, first-order absorption rate, apparent volume of distribution and total clearance were 0.316 h (10.6%), 1.12 h-1 (10.7%), 140 L (7.7%) and 14.7 L/h (6.97%), respectively. No significant association was observed with hyperglycaemia, glycated haemoglobin, diabetes diagnosis, age, sex, weight, body mass index, SLC22A2 or SLC22 A4 genotypes.

22,23715758,"Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of hair follicle tumors, renal tumors and pulmonary cysts. BHD is caused by heterozygous, predominantly truncating mutations in the folliculin (FLCN) gene located on chromosome 17, which encodes a highly conserved tumor suppressor protein. Although management of renal tumors of low malignant potential is the primary focus of longitudinal care, pulmonary manifestations including cyst formation and spontaneous pneumothorax are among the most common manifestations in BHD. Due to the lack of awareness, there is commonly a delay in the pulmonary diagnosis of BHD and patients are frequently mislabeled as having chronic obstructive lung disease, emphysema or common bullae/blebs. A family history of pneumothorax is present in 35 % of patients with BHD. Certain imaging characteristics of the cysts, including size, basilar and peripheral predominance, perivascular and periseptal localization, and elliptical or lentiform shape can suggest the diagnosis of BHD based on inspection of the chest CT scan alone. Recurrent pneumothoraces are common and early pleurodesis is recommended.

BHD is caused by DNA mutations in the folliculin (FLCN) gene, which helps create a tumor stopping protein or molecule. While managing low-risk kidney tumors is primary for long-term care, lung issues like cyst formation and random lung collapsions are common in BHD. Due to unawareness, identifying BHD is usually delayed. Patients are frequently mislabeled with long-lasting, interfering lung disease, emphysema (a lung disease involving damaged air sacs), or fluid-filled blisters. A family history of collapsing lungs is present in 35% of patients with BHD. Certain attributes of cysts, like size, location, and shape, can help identify BHD by medical imaging alone. Reoccuring collapsing lungs are common. Early removal of the space between the lungs and chest wall is recommended. We need to better understand how FLCN affects lung cyst formation and how lung problems from BHD develop.","Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare, genetic disorder associated with the development of hair follicle tumors, kidney tumors and pulmonary cysts, which are sacs filled with air in the lungs.

44,30068251,"Hypovolemic shock exists as a spectrum, with its early stages characterized by subtle pathophysiologic tissue insults and its late stages defined by multi-system organ dysfunction. The importance of timely detection of shock is well known, as early interventions improve mortality, while delays render these same interventions ineffective. However, detection is limited by the monitors, parameters, and vital signs that are traditionally used in the intensive care unit (ICU). Many parameters change minimally during the early stages, and when they finally become abnormal, hypovolemic shock has already occurred. The compensatory reserve (CR) is a parameter that represents a new paradigm for assessing physiologic status, as it comprises the sum total of compensatory mechanisms that maintain adequate perfusion to vital organs during hypovolemia. When these mechanisms are overwhelmed, hemodynamic instability and circulatory collapse will follow. Previous studies involving CR measurements demonstrated their utility in detecting central blood volume loss before hemodynamic parameters and vital signs changed. Measurements of the CR have also been used in clinical studies involving patients with traumatic injuries or bleeding, and the results from these studies have been promising. Moreover, these measurements can be made at the bedside, and they provide a real-time assessment of hemodynamic stability. Given the need for rapid diagnostics when treating critically ill patients, CR measurements would complement parameters that are currently being used. Consequently, the purpose of this article is to introduce a conceptual framework where the CR represents a new approach to monitoring critically ill patients. Within this framework, we present evidence to support the notion that the use of the CR could potentially improve the outcomes of ICU patients by alerting intensivists to impending hypovolemic shock before its onset.","Hypovolemic shock is a spectrum of reactions.

Treatment, which includes a low Phe diet supplemented with amino acid formulas, commences soon after diagnosis within the first weeks of life. Although dietary treatment has been successful in preventing intellectual disability in early treated PKU patients, there are major issues with dietary compliance due to palatability of the diet. Other potential issues associated with dietary therapy include nutritional deficiencies especially vitamin D and B12. Suboptimal outcomes in cognitive and executive functioning have been reported in patients who adhere poorly to dietary therapy.

Studies show that perphenazine prevents nausea and vomiting in children and adults without serious side effects compared to sham treatment.","Despite newer anti-nausea drugs, perphenazine (an anti-psychotic) is still used in multimodal treatment of nausea and vomiting post-operation in high-risk patients that need two or more drugs. This work measures the success and safety of perphenazine in preventing post-operation nausea and vomiting. Eleven trials published between 1965 and 1999 included 2081 total participats for analysis. In children, 0.07 mg kg of perphenzaine prevented vomiting while 5 mg prevented post-operation nausea and vomiting in adults. Compared to newer anti-nausea and -vomiting drugs, no differences were observed. Reporting of harmful events was poor. Three trials reported temporary sedation or a calming effect. Perphenazine may be effective in preventing post-operation nausea and vomiting in children and adults without serious harmful effects."
17,1536482,"Study objectives: Many factors influence the rate of gastric emptying and therefore the rate of drug absorption in the orally poisoned patient. Limited studies have evaluated the effect of body position on the rate of gastric emptying of radiographically marked foods and contrast media, but effects on drug absorption have not been studied previously. Our hypothesis was that body position would have an effect on the rate of drug absorption in an oral overdose model. Design: A blinded, within-subjects (crossover) design. Participants: Six male and six female healthy, adult volunteer subjects with no concurrent drug use or medications affecting gastrointestinal function. Interventions: Five body positions commonly used in prehospital and emergency department settings were examined: left lateral decubitus, right lateral decubitus, supine, prone, and sitting. All were performed by all subjects in random order with a three-day washout phase between trials. To simulate an acute overdose, fasted subjects ingested 80 mg/kg acetaminophen in the form of 160-mg pediatric tablets. Each subject then remained in the body position for that trial for two hours. Acetaminophen levels were obtained at 15-minute intervals, and a two-hour area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each subject trial to represent total drug absorption during each study period. Investigators were blinded to all results until all trials were completed. Measurements and main results: All subjects completed the study. Group mean drug absorption as represented by two-hour AUC (mg.L.min) was calculated for each body position. AUC for left lateral decubitus (6,006 +/- 2,614) was lowest but did not significantly differ from that for supine (6,649 +/- 2,761). Both were significantly less than those for prone (7,432 +/- 1,809), right lateral decubitus (8,950 +/- 1,405), and sitting (8,608 +/- 1,725) positions (P less than .05 by one-way analysis of variance and follow-up paired t tests). Conclusion: Initial drug absorption as determined by two-hour AUC was lowest in the left lateral decubitus position. Although the difference between the left lateral decubitus and supine positions did not reach statistical significance, both left lateral decubitus and supine were significantly lower than three other common patient body positions tested. Because the left lateral decubitus position has other advantages (eg, prevention of aspiration) in addition to minimizing drug absorption, we recommend that orally poisoned patients be placed in the left lateral decubitus position for prehospital and initial ED management.","Many things determine how fast the stomach empties and therefore how fast a drug is taken in by the body in a person who swallows a toxic substance. Few studies have rated the effect of body position on how fast the stomach empties via a technique to more easily see stomach contents with x-rays. However, effects on how fast a drug is absorbed have not been studied before. We thought that body position would have an effect on how fast a drug is absorbed in a person who swallows a toxic substance. Participants were six male and six female healthy, adult volunteers not taking any drugs or medicine affecting stomach function. We looked at five body positions often used before hospital and emergency room treatment: left side, right side, back, stomach, and sitting. Participants did every position in random order with a 3-day break between trials. To pretend that participants swallowed a toxic substance, participants did not eat prior to taking 80 mg of Tylenol/kg of body weight in the form of 160-mg children's tablets. Each participant then stayed in the body position for that trial for two hours. We measured Tylenol levels every 15 minutes. We calculated how much Tylenol participants absorbed over 2 hours for each trial. Investigators did not know the results until after the trials were done. All participants finished the study. We calculated average amount of drug absorbed for each body position. The average amount of drug absorbed was lowest for the left side, which was similar to the back position. Absorption for the left side and back were less than for stomach, right side, and sitting positions. We concluded that drug absorption was lowest for the left side position. Although the difference between the left side and back positions did not differ significantly, both the left side and back positions were significantly lower than the three other positions tested. Because the left side position is better for other reasons (e.g., material entering the airway or lungs by accident) than decreasing how much drug is absorbed, we suggest that people who swallow a toxic substance be put in the left side position before going to the hospital and emergency room.",
53,31211392,"Objective: To determine the effect of morning exercise in the fasting condition vs afternoon exercise on blood glucose responses to resistance exercise (RE). Research design and methods: For this randomized crossover design, 12 participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus [nine females; aged 31 ± 8.9 years; diabetes duration, 19.1 ± 8.3 years; HbA1c, 7.4% ± 0.8% (57.4 ± 8.5 mmol/mol)] performed ∼40 minutes of RE (three sets of eight repetitions, seven exercises, at the individual's predetermined eight repetition maximum) at either 7 am (fasting) or 5 pm. Sessions were performed at least 48 hours apart. Venous blood samples were collected immediately preexercise, immediately postexercise, and 60 minutes postexercise. Interstitial glucose was monitored overnight postexercise by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Results: Data are presented as mean ± SD. Blood glucose rose during fasting morning exercise (9.5 ± 3.0 to 10.4 ± 3.0 mmol/L), whereas it declined with afternoon exercise (8.2 ± 2.5 to 7.4 ± 2.6 mmol/L; P = 0.031 for time-by-treatment interaction). Sixty minutes postexercise, blood glucose concentration was significantly higher after fasting morning exercise than after afternoon exercise (10.9 ± 3.2 vs 7.9 ± 2.9 mmol/L; P = 0.019). CGM data indicated more glucose variability (2.7 ± 1.1 vs 2.0 ± 0.7 mmol/L; P = 0.019) and more frequent hyperglycemia (12 events vs five events; P = 0.025) after morning RE than after afternoon RE. Conclusions: Compared with afternoon RE, morning (fasting) RE was associated with distinctly different blood glucose responses and postexercise profiles.","The objective of this study is to determine the effect of morning exercise after fasting (no food or drink except water for 8 to 10 hours) vs afternoon exercise on blood sugar responses to resistance exercise, also known as strength or weight training to build muscle. In this study, 12 participants with type 1 diabetes perform about 40 minutes of resistance exercise (three sets of eight repetitions, seven exercises) at either 7 am (fasting) or 5 pm. Sessions are performed at least 48 hours apart. Blood samples are collected immediately before exercise, immediately after exercise, and 60 minutes after exercise. Interstitial sugar is taken from the fluid surrounding the cells of tissues rather the blood. Interstitial sugar is monitored overnight after exercise by using continuous sugar monitoring device. Blood sugar rises during fasting morning exercise, whereas it declined with afternoon exercise. Sixty minutes after exercise, blood sugar is significantly higher after fasting morning exercise than after afternoon exercise. Data from the continuous sugar monitoring device indicated more changes in sugar levels and more frequent hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) after morning resistance exercise than after afternoon resistance exercise. Compared with afternoon resistance exercise, morning (fasting) resistance exercise is associated with distinctly different blood sugar responses and post-exercise responses.",
19,32844196,"The natural pattern of progression of Parkinson's disease is largely unknown because patients are conventionally followed on treatment. As Parkinson's disease progresses, the true magnitude of the long-duration response to levodopa remains unknown, because it can only be estimated indirectly in treated patients. We aimed to describe the natural course of motor symptoms by assessing the natural OFF in consecutive Parkinson's disease patients never exposed to treatment (drug-naïve), and to investigate the effects of daily levodopa on the progression of motor disability in the OFF medication state over a 2-year period. In this prospective naturalistic study in sub-Saharan Africa, 30 Parkinson's disease patients (age at onset 58 ± 14 years, disease duration 7 ± 4 years) began levodopa monotherapy and were prospectively assessed using the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Data were collected at baseline, at 1-year and 2-years follow-up. First-ever levodopa intake induced a significant improvement in motor symptoms (natural OFF versus ON state UPDRS-III 41.9 ± 15.9 versus 26.8 ± 15.1, respectively; P < 0.001). At 1-year follow-up, OFF state UPDRS-III score after overnight withdrawal of levodopa was considerably lower than natural OFF (26.5 ± 14.9; P < 0 .001). This effect was not modified by disease duration. At the 2-year follow-up, motor signs after overnight OFF (30.2 ± 14.2) were still 30% milder than natural OFF (P = 0.001). The ON state UPDRS-III at the first-ever levodopa challenge was similar to the overnight OFF score at 1-year follow-up and the two conditions were correlated (r = 0.72, P < 0.001). Compared to the natural progression of motor disability, levodopa treatment resulted in a 31% lower annual decline in UPDRS-III scores in the OFF state (3.33 versus 2.30 points/year) with a lower model's variance explained by disease duration (67% versus 36%). Using the equation regressed on pretreatment data, we predicted the natural OFF at 1-year and 2-year follow-up visits and estimated that the magnitude of the long-duration response to levodopa ranged between 60% and 65% of total motor benefit provided by levodopa, independently of disease duration (P = 0.13). Although levodopa therapy was associated with motor fluctuations, overnight OFF disability during levodopa was invariably less severe than the natural course of the disease, independently of disease duration. The same applies to the yearly decline in UPDRS-III scores in the OFF state. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the long-duration response to levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Understanding the natural course of Parkinson's disease and the long-duration response to levodopa may help to develop therapeutic strategies increasing its magnitude to improve patient quality of life and to better interpret the outcome of randomized clinical trials on disease-modifying therapies that still rely on the overnight OFF to define Parkinson's disease progression.","The natural progress of Parkinson's disease (a brain-related disorder affecting movement) is largely unknown because patients are usually examined during treatment. As Parkinson's disease progresses, the effect of the long-lasting response to levodopa (common Parkinsons's medication) remains unknown since it is measured indirectly in treated patients. We tried to describe the natural course of movement symptoms by measuring the OFF state when symptoms occur in patients never given treatment (drug-naïve) for Parkinson's disease. For 2 years, we also explored how daily levodopa affects the progression of movement symptoms in the OFF state after treatment wears off. In this lengthy, observational study in sub-Saharan Africa, 30 patients with Parkinson's disease (age at onset 58 ± 14 years, disease duration 7 ± 4 years) began levodopa therapy and were later measured with a specific disease scale for Parkinson's. Data were collected at start, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up. First-time levodopa intake improved movement symptoms. After 1 year, severity of symptoms of Parkinson's disease was lower after overnight withdrawal of levodopa than without it at all. The lowered severity by levodopa was not altered by disease length. After 2 years, movement signs after overnight withdrawal of medication was still 30% milder than movement signs with no treatment ever. The no-symptom state after first-time levodopa was similar and related to the overnight typical-symptom state after 1 year. Compared to the natural progression, levodopa reduces symptom severity via a 31% annual decline with some leeway due to disease duration. We calculated that the response to levodopa involved a possible 60-65% benefit of total motor activity, regardless of disease duration. While levodopa relates to movement fluctuations, the typical-symptom state after overnight levodopa withdrawal was less severe than without medication at all, regardless of disease duration. A yearly decline in symptom severity during the typical-symptom state also exists. We need more research to explain the mechanisms for the response to levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Understanding how Parkinson's disease progresses and the response to levodopa may help create better treatments and better assess clinical trials for Parkinson's disease.","The natural development of Parkinson's disease (a brain disorder that affects movement and coordination) is largely unknown because patients are usually evaluated while on treatment. As Parkinson's disease progresses, the true impact of the long-term response to levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) remains unknown because it can only be estimated indirectly in treated patients. Researchers aimed to describe the natural progression of motor (movement) symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and slowness of movement by evaluating the natural OFF state (when symptoms return) in patients with Parkinson's disease who have never taken drugs to treat the disease. Researchers also aimed to investigate the effects of daily levodopa on the progression of motor disability (partial or total loss of movement in part of the body) in the OFF medication state over a 2-year period. In this study in sub-Saharan Africa, 30 Parkinson's disease patients started levodopa and are assessed using the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a rating tool used to measure the severity and progression of Parkinson's disease in patients. Data are collected at the start of the study and at 1-year and 2-year follow-up appointments. Taking levodopa for the first time has a significant improvement in motor symptoms. At 1-year follow-up, OFF state (when symptoms return) UPDRS-III score after overnight withdrawal of levodopa was considerably lower than natural OFF. This effect does not change based on how long the person has the disease. At the 2-year follow-up, motor signs after overnight OFF are still milder than natural OFF. The ON state (patient feels energetic and can move) UPDRS-III at the first-ever levodopa challenge is similar to the overnight OFF score at 1-year follow-up, and the two conditions are connected. Compared to the natural progression of motor disability, levodopa treatment resulted in a lower annual decline in UPDRS-III scores in the OFF state with a lower number than expected, which is explained by disease duration. Using data taken from before treatment started, researchers made predictions of the natural OFF at 1-year and 2-year follow-up visits and estimated that the magnitude of how long patients have a response to levodopa ranged between 60% and 65% of benefit on motor ability provided by levodopa, independently of how long patients had the disease. Although levodopa is linked to changes in motor ability, overnight OFF disability (when symptoms return) during levodopa is less severe than the natural course of the disease, independently of how long patients had the disease. The same applies to the yearly decline in UPDRS-III scores in the OFF state. Further research is needed to clarify the processes underlying the long-duration response to levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Understanding the natural course of Parkinson's disease and how long motor improvements last while on levodopa may help to develop treatment strategies, increasing its impact to improve patient quality of life and to better understand the outcome of clinical studies on therapies that still rely on the overnight OFF to define Parkinson's disease progression."

However, these portals remain the least well-characterized part of the Cl- transport pathway; even the number of functional portals is uncertain, and if multiple portals do exist, their relative functional contributions are unknown. Here, we used patch-clamp recording to identify the contributions of positively charged amino acid side chains located in CFTR's cytoplasmic transmembrane extensions to portal function. Mutagenesis-mediated neutralization of several charged side chains reduced single-channel Cl- conductance. However, these same mutations differentially affected channel blockade by cytoplasmic suramin and Pt(NO2)42- anions. We considered and tested several models by which the contribution of these positively charged side chains to one or more independent or non-independent portals to the pore could affect Cl- conductance and interactions with blockers. Overall, our results suggest the existence of a single portal that is lined by several positively charged side chains that interact electrostatically with both Cl- and blocking anions. We further propose that mutations at other sites indirectly alter the function of this single portal.

20,33404081,"Objective: Since several recent meta-analyses report a dose-response relationship for the antidepressant effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), we investigated how these drugs are dosed in clinical practice. Methods: Through linkage of nation- or region-wide registers, we describe SSRI doses in 50,365 individuals residing in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden, with an incident diagnosis of depression and initiating SSRI treatment between 2007 and 2016. The primary question was to elucidate to what extent these individuals had been prescribed a daily dose that according to recent meta-analyses is required to elicit the maximum antidepressant effect, that is >20 mg citalopram, >10 mg escitalopram, >10 mg fluoxetine, >10 mg paroxetine or >50 mg sertraline. Results: In all, 21,049 (54%) out of 38,868 individuals <65 years of age, and 9,131 (79%) out of 11,497 individuals ≥65 years of age, never received an SSRI dose reported to exert maximum antidepressant effect. These prescribing practices were seen for citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline, but not for fluoxetine and paroxetine, and were frequent in both primary and secondary/tertiary care. Suggesting that doses here defined as maximum efficacy doses, when prescribed, are usually not intolerable, between 59% and 68% of individuals <65 years of age received such a dose also for the subsequent prescription, that is as frequently as in those prescribed a sub-maximum efficacy dose (52-69%). Conclusion: Most patients being prescribed an SSRI to treat their depression never receive the dose that according to recent meta-analyses is most likely to effectively combat their condition. The lack of consensus regarding effective dosing of SSRIs may have contributed to this state of affairs.","Several analyses using data from multiple studies have found a relationship between the amount of a medicine given (dose) and its effect in a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

Researchers describe SSRI doses in 50,365 people living in a specific region in Sweden, with a diagnosis of depression and starting SSRI treatment between 2007 and 2016. The main question is to explain the extent these people are prescribed a daily dose that is expected to get a peak response that would not go higher with a higher dose, which is > 20 mg of citalopram, >10 mg escitalopram, >10 mg fluoxetine, >10 mg paroxetine or >50 mg sertraline - all SSRIs. Overall, 21,049 (54%) out of 38,868 individuals <65 years of age, and 9,131 (79%) out of 11,497 individuals ≥65 years of age, never receive an SSRI dose reported to bring about a maximum antidepressant effect.

Between 59% and 68% of individuals <65 years of age received the maximum efficacy dose (the dose where an increased dose given would not lead to improvement) for the next prescription. That percent is as frequently as in those prescribed a sub-maximum efficacy dose which is the dose that has a lower response despite an increase in the dose amount. In conclusion, most patients taking an SSRI to treat their depression never receive the dose that is most likely to effectively fight their condition based on detailed reviews of available data. The lack of agreement on the effective dose amount of SSRIs may have contributed to this conclusion.",
47,34711245,"Background: Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) encoded by the ALPL gene is of particular importance for bone mineralization. Mutation in the ALPL gene can lead to persistent low ALP activity resulting in the rare disease Hypophosphatasia (HPP) that is characterized by disturbed bone and dental mineralization. While severe forms are extremely rare with an estimated prevalence of 1/100.000, recent studies suggest that moderate form caused by heterozygous mutations are much more frequent with an estimated prevalence of 1/508. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of low AP levels in the population based on laboratory measurements. Methods: In this study, the prevalence of low AP activity and elevated pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) levels was analyzed in 6.918.126 measurements from 2011 to 2016 at a single laboratory in northern Germany. Only laboratory values of subjects older than 18 years of age were included. Only the first measurement was included, all repeated values were excluded.

Here, 6.09% showed elevated pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) levels. This suggest that 0.52% (1:194) of subjects show laboratory signs of HPP. Conclusion: These data support the genetic estimation that the prevalence of moderate forms of HPP may be significantly higher than expected.

53,21388440,"Aims: Individuals with Type 1 diabetes mellitus are susceptible to hypoglycaemia during and after continuous moderate-intensity exercise, but hyperglycaemia during intermittent high-intensity exercise. The combination of both forms of exercise may have a moderating effect on glycaemia in recovery. The aims of this study were to compare the physiological responses and associated glycaemic changes to continuous moderate-intensity exercise vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise + intermittent high-intensity exercise in athletes with Type 1 diabetes. Methods: Interstitial glucose levels were measured in a blinded fashion in 11 trained athletes with Type 1 diabetes during two sedentary days and during 2 days in which 45 min of afternoon continuous moderate-intensity exercise occurred either with or without intermittent high-intensity exercise. The total amount of work performed and the duration of exercise was identical between sessions. Results: During exercise, heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, oxygen utilization, ventilation and blood lactate levels were higher during continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise (all P < 0.05). Despite these marked cardiorespiratory differences between trials, there was no difference in the reduction of interstitial glucose or plasma glucose levels between the exercise trials. Nocturnal glucose levels were higher in continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise and in sedentary vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise (P < 0.05). Compared with continuous moderate-intensity exercise alone, continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise was associated with less post-exercise hypoglycaemia (5.2 vs. 1.5% of the time spent with glucose < 4.0 mmol/l) and more post-exercise hyperglycaemia (33.8 vs. 20.4% of time > 11.0 mmol/l). Conclusions: Although the decreases in glucose level during continuous moderate-intensity exercise and continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise are similar, the latter form of exercise protects against nocturnal hypoglycaemia in athletes with Type 1 diabetes.","People with Type 1 diabetes are vulnerable to developing low blood sugar, also called hypoglycemia, during and after continuous moderate-level exercise, but they are also at risk of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) during periodic high-intensity exercise. The combination of both moderate and high-intensity exercise may have an effect on blood sugar levels. The aims of this study are to compare the body's physical responses and blood sugar changes to continuous moderate-intensity exercise vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise + periodic high-intensity exercise in athletes with Type 1 diabetes. Interstitial sugar levels are taken from the fluid surrounding the cells of tissues in 11 trained athletes with Type 1 diabetes. Samples are taken during two days when they were not active and during 2 days in which 45 minutes of afternoon continuous moderate-intensity exercise occurred either with or without periodic high-intensity exercise. The total amount of work performed and the duration of exercise is identical between sessions. During exercise, heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio to determine how the body is getting energy, oxygen utilization, ventilation (breathing) and blood lactatic acid (waste build-up from exercise) levels are higher during continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise. Despite these noticeable heart-lung differences, there is no difference in the reduction of interstitial sugar or blood sugar levels between the exercise trials. Nighttime sugar levels are higher in continuous moderate-intensity + periodic high-intensity exercise and in inactive vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise. Compared with continuous moderate-intensity exercise alone, continuous moderate-intensity + periodic high-intensity exercise is associated with less hypoglycemia after exercise and more hyperglycemia after exercise. Although the decreases in sugar level during continuous moderate-intensity exercise and continuous moderate-intensity + periodic high-intensity exercise are similar, the latter form of exercise protects against nighttime hypoglycemia in athletes with Type 1 diabetes.",
11,32073132,"The main source of energy for brain and other organs is glucose. To obtain energy for all tissue, glucose has to come through glycolysis; then as pyruvate it is converted to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and finally enters citric acid cycle. What happens when one of these stages become disturb? Mutation in genes encoding subunits of PDC leads to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. Abnormalities in PDC activity result in severe metabolic and brain malformations. For better understanding the development and mechanism of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency the murine model of this disease has been created. Studies on a murine model showed similar malformation in brain structures as in the patients suffered from pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency such as reduced neuronal density, heterotopias of grey matter, reduced size of corpus callosum and pyramids. There is still no effective cure for PDC-deficiency. Promising therapy seemed to be ketogenic diet, which substitutes glucose to ketone bodies as a source of energy. Studies have shown that ketogenic diet decreases lactic acidosis and inhibits brain malformations, but not the mortality in early childhood. The newest reports say that phenylbutyrate increases the level of PDC in the brain, because it reduces the level of inactive form of PDH. Experiments on human fibroblast and zebra fish PDC-deficiency model showed that phenylbutyrate is promising cure to PDC-deficiency. This review summarizes the most important findings on the metabolic and morphological effects of PDC-deficiency and research for treatment therapy.","The main source of energy for the brain and other organs is glucose, a type of sugar in the blood that comes from the food people eat. In order for energy to reach all tissues, glucose has to go through a process with several stages. One of these stages is called pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) which converts molecules and links cells to the final stage of creating energy. What happens when one of these stages is disturbed? Genetic changes in the PDC process leads to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, a disease where the body cannot properly breakdown food to create fuel or energy. Errors in PDC (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) activity also result in severe disruption of the body's ability to process and distribute nutrients and can create brain malformations where the brain or nervous system is damaged or has not formed properly during pregnancy. To better understand the pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, researchers created an experiment that includes common household rats and mice. Studies using an animal experiment showed similar abnormalities in brain structures compared to patients suffering from pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. There is still no effective cure for pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-deficiency. Promising therapy may be a low carb, high fat diet called a ketogenic diet, where the body substitutes glucose with ketone bodies (chemicals the body makes when there is not enough glucose) as a source of energy. Studies show that a ketogenic diet decreases lactic acidosis (lactic acid build up that can cause nausea, vomiting, and breathing problems) and slows down brain malformations, but not death in early childhood. The newest reports say that phenylbutyrate, a type of salt in the body that helps remove ammonia and waste from the body, increases the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in the brain. Experiments on human fibroblast (a cell found in connective tissues) and zebra fish showed that phenylbutyrate is a promising cure to dehydrogenase complex deficiency. This review summarizes the most important findings on the effects of PDC-deficiency on metabolism and development of the brain and on research for treatment therapy.",
34,34164121,"Adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle may be a useful primary and secondary prevention strategy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). This cross-sectional study aimed to explore adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle and its association with cardiometabolic markers and kidney function in 99 people aged 73⋅2 ± 10⋅5 years with non-dialysis dependant CKD (stages 3-5) at a single Australian centre. Adherence was assessed using an a priori index, the Mediterranean Lifestyle (MEDLIFE) index. Cardiometabolic markers (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HbA1c and random blood glucose) and kidney function (estimated GFR) were sourced from medical records and blood pressure measured upon recruitment. Overall, adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle was moderate to low with an average MEDLIFE index score of 11⋅33 ± 3⋅31. Adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle was associated with employment (r 0⋅30, P = 0⋅004). Mediterranean dietary habits were associated with cardiometabolic markers, such as limiting sugar in beverages was associated with lower diastolic blood pressure (r 0⋅32, P = 0⋅002), eating in moderation with favourable random blood glucose (r 0⋅21, P = 0⋅043), having more than two snack foods per week with HbA1c (r 0⋅29, P = 0⋅037) and LDL-cholesterol (r 0⋅41, P = 0⋅002). Interestingly, eating in company was associated with a lower frequency of depression (χ 2 5⋅975, P = 0⋅015). To conclude, Mediterranean dietary habits were favourably associated with cardiometabolic markers and management of some comorbidities in this group of people with non-dialysis dependent CKD.","Keeping a Mediterranean lifestyle may be a useful primary and secondary prevention plan for chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aims to explore adherence (commitment) to a Mediterranean lifestyle and its association with blood pressure, cholesterol, and other heart related measures, as well as its impact on kidney function.

Adherence is assessed (measured) using the Mediterranean Lifestyle (MEDLIFE) index, that includes questions on food consumption, dietary habits, physical activity, rest, and social interactions. Tests on total cholesterol, LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, blood sugar levels in the last 2-3 months and at any random time, and kidney function are collected from medical records and blood pressure measured at the start of the study. Overall, adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle is moderate to low with an average MEDLIFE index score of 11⋅33 ± 3⋅31. Adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle is associated with employment. Mediterranean dietary habits are associated with certain heart-related measures, such as how limiting sugar in beverages is associated with lower diastolic blood pressure (bottom number of blood pressure readings), eating in moderation with favorable blood sugar levels tested at random, having more than two snack foods per week with blood sugar tests, and LDL-cholesterol. Interestingly, eating with others is associated with a lower frequency of depression. In conclusion, Mediterranean dietary habits are positively linked with heart-related measures and care of other health problems in this group of people with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease.",
18,18058723,"Introduction: Nutrition therapy is an integral part of the management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Most women with GDM are treated by nutritional management alone. The goal of our study was to compare low and high carbohydrate diets in their effectiveness, safety and tolerability in women with GDM. Material and methods: The study group consisted of 30 Caucasian women newly diagnosed with GDM, with a mean age of 28.7 +/- 3.7 years and pregnancy duration of 29.2 +/- 5.4 weeks. The patients were randomised into two groups: those on a low and those on a high carbohydrate diet (45% vs. 65% respectively of energy supply coming from carbohydrates). The presence of urine ketones was controlled every day. After two weeks daily glucose profiles and compliance with the recommended diets were analysed. Results: Glucose concentration before implementation of the diet regimen did not differ between groups. No changes in fasting blood glucose were noticed in the group that had followed a low carbohydrate diet, although a significant decrease in glucose concentration was observed after breakfast (102 +/- 16 vs. 94 +/- 11 mg/dl), lunch (105 +/- 12 vs. 99 +/- 9 mg/dl) and dinner (112 +/- 16 vs. 103 +/- 13 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). In the high carbohydrate diet group fasting and after-breakfast glucose concentration did not change. A significant decrease in glycaemia was noticed after lunch (106 +/- 15 vs. 96 +/- 7 mg/dl) and dinner (107 +/- 12 vs. 97 +/- 7 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). Ketonuria was not observed in either group. Obstetrical outcomes did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Both high and low carbohydrate diets are effective and safe. A diet with carbohydrate limitation should be recommended to women who experience the highest glycaemia levels after breakfast.","Nutrition therapy (treatment that uses food to prevent and reverse disease) is a key part of the care of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (women diagnosed with diabetes for the first time during pregnancy). Most women with GDM are treated only by managing their nutrition. The goal of this study is to compare low and high carbohydrate (carbohydrates that provide fuel for the body often found in sugary foods, pasta, and bread) diets. The study group has 30 white women newly diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus. The patients are randomly put into two groups: those on a low carbohydrate (carb) diet and those on a high carb diet. The presence of urine ketones (substances that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar) is controlled every day. After two weeks, how well women stayed on the recommend diets and daily blood sugar measures were analyzed. Blood sugar levels before starting the new diets did not differ between the two groups. No changes in fasting blood sugar (blood sugar levels after not eating for set amount of time) are noticed in the group that has a low carb diet, although a significant decrease in blood sugar is seen after breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In the high carb diet group, fasting and after breakfast blood sugar levels did not change. A significant decrease in glycaemia (concentration of blood sugar) is noticed after lunch. Ketonuria (high amounts of ketones in the urine) is not observed in either group. Pregnancy outcomes did not differ between the two groups. In conclusion, both high and low carb diets are effective and safe. A diet that limits carbs should be recommended to women who experience the highest concentration of blood sugar levels after breakfast.",
50,1887812,"Sarcoidosis is characterized by granuloma formation, the macrophage being the most important building block. The activated macrophage in sarcoidosis produces interleukin-1 (II-1). It is well known that interleukin-1, among other functions, stimulates the hepatic production of C-reactive protein. We therefore prospectively measured the serum C-reactive protein in 17 patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis, 10 patients with other chronic interstitial lung diseases of unknown etiology, 11 patients with active lung tuberculosis, and 10 healthy volunteers. Serum C-reactive protein was assayed by enzymoimmunodiffusion test. The serum C-reactive protein was negative in 13 patients suffering from active sarcoidosis and positive in four. Patients with other interstitial lung diseases had negative results in 7 and positive in 3 cases. The analyses of C-reactive protein in patients with sputum positive lung tuberculosis were positive in 10 cases. All the healthy controls had negative C-reactive protein measurements. The difference between the groups was statistically significant when sarcoidosis and tuberculosis serum C-reactive protein measurements were compared (p less than 0.01), as well as the difference between the group of other interstitial lung diseases and tuberculosis (p less than 0.01). In this respect, the measurements of serum C-reactive protein are valuable in the differentiation of sarcoidosis and other chronic interstitial lung diseases of unknown etiology from tuberculosis and other diseases which are known to induce an acute phase response.","Sarcoidosis is a disease that is characterized by granuloma formation or the tiny growth collections of inflammation (infection-fighting) cells. One of these cell types is the immune cell, macrophage. Macrophages are one of the most important building blocks of this disease. Macrophage in sarcoidosis produces interleukin-1 (II-1), a protein that helps fight infections. Interleukin-1 has many functions, including the stimulation of the hepatic (liver) production of C-reactive protein. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). Serum (blood) C-reactive protein was measured in 48 patients. Seventeen of the patients had active sarcoidosis in the lung. Ten patients had other lung diseases of unknown origin. Eleven patients had active lung tuberculosis (a serious lung infection). Ten patients were healthy volunteers. Serum C-reactive protein was measured. The serum C-reactive protein was negative (no detection) in 13 patients suffering from active sarcoidosis and positive in four. Patients with other lung diseases had negative results in 7 cases and positive (was detected) in 3 cases. The analyses of C-reactive protein in patients with lung tuberculosis were positive in 10 cases. All the healthy controls had negative C-reactive protein measurements. The difference between the groups was statistically significant when sarcoidosis and tuberculosis serum C-reactive protein measurements were compared.

18,32537643,"Background: Lower carbohydrate diets have the potential to improve glycemia but may increase ketonemia in women with gestational diabetes (GDM). We hypothesized that modestly lower carbohydrate intake would not increase ketonemia. Objective: To compare blood ketone concentration, risk of ketonemia, and pregnancy outcomes in women with GDM randomly assigned to a lower carbohydrate diet or routine care. Methods: Forty-six women aged (mean ± SEM) 33.3 ± 0.6 y and prepregnancy BMI 26.8 ± 0.9 kg/m2 were randomly assigned at 28.5 ± 0.4 wk to a modestly lower carbohydrate diet (MLC, ∼135 g/d carbohydrate) or routine care (RC, ∼200 g/d) for 6 wk. Blood ketones were ascertained by finger prick test strips and 3-d food diaries were collected at baseline and end of the intervention. Results: There were no detectable differences in blood ketones between completers in the MLC group compared with the RC group (0.1 ± 0.0 compared with 0.1 ± 0.0 mmol/L, n = 33, P = 0.31, respectively), even though carbohydrate and total energy intake were significantly lower in the intervention group (carbohydrate 165 ± 7 compared with 190 ± 9 g, P = 0.04; energy 7040 ± 240 compared with 8230 ± 320 kJ, P <0.01, respectively). Only 20% of participants in the MLC group met the target intake compared with 65% in the RC group (P <0.01). There were no differences in birth weight, rate of large-for-gestational-age infants, percent fat mass, or fat-free mass between groups. Conclusions: An intervention to reduce carbohydrate intake in GDM did not raise ketones to clinical significance, possibly because the target of 135 g/d was difficult to achieve in pregnancy. Feeding studies with food provision may be needed to assess the benefits and risks of low-carbohydrate diets.","A low carbohydrate diet (a diet that limits carbohydrates often found in sugary foods, pasta, and bread) has the potential to improve glycemia (blood sugar level) but it may increase ketonemia (an unusually high amount of ketones, a substance that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar) in women with gestational diabetes (a type of high blood sugar affecting pregnant women). Researchers tested the theory that eating a modestly low amount of carbohydrates would not increase ketonemia. The objective of this study is to compare the amount of ketones that are in the blood, the risk of ketonemia, and pregnancy outcomes, such as full-term or premature, in women with gestational diabetes who are randomly assigned to a lower carbohydrate (carb) diet or routine care. In this study, 46 women are randomly assigned to a modestly lower carb diet or to routine care. Ketones, the substance the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar, in the blood are measured by finger prick tests. Food diaries are collected at the beginning of the study and at the end. The results show that there are no detectable differences in blood ketones between participants in the modestly lower carb diet group when compared with women in the routine care group, even though carbs and total energy intake are much lower in the modestly low carb diet group. Only 20% of participants in the modestly low carb diet group met the target amount of consumption compared with 65% in the routine care group. There are no differences in birth weight, rate of large-for-gestational-age infants (a newborn who weighs more than 90% of other newborns of the same gestational age at birth), percent of fat in the body, or fat-free mass (muscle mass) between the groups. In conclusion, a change to reduce the amount of carbs consumed by women with gestational diabetes did not raise ketones to a significant level, possibly because the target of the amount of food was difficult to achieve in pregnancy. Feeding studies with provided food may be needed to determine the benefits and risks of low-carbohydrate diets.","Lower carb diets may improve blood sugar but may increase blood ketone bodies (particles made from fat breakdown) in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) (high blood sugar affecting pregnant women). We presume that fairly lower carbohydrate intake would not increase blood ketone bodies. To compare levels of blood ketone made from fat breakdown, risk of high blood ketone bodies, and pregnancy outcomes in women with gestational diabetes randomly given a lower carb diet or regular care. Forty-six women around 33 years of age were randomly split at 28.5 weeks to either a modestly lower carb diet (MLC) or standard, routine care (RC) for 6 weeks. There was no difference in blood ketones between those in the MLC diet group relative to the RC group, even though carb and total energy intake was lower in the diet group. Only 20% in the MLC diet group met the goal intake versus the 65% in the RC group. No differences in birth weight, rate of large-for-prenatal-age infants, percent fat mass, or fat-free mass between groups existed. Reducing carb intake in those with gestational diabetes did not raise ketones made from fat breakdown, possibly because the carb target was difficult to achieve in pregnancy. Feeding studies providing food may have to assess the effects of low-carb diets."

20,1378369,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a recently developed class of drugs with significantly greater antidepressant efficacy than placebo. Generally, in double-blind comparative trials, all SSRIs demonstrated antidepressant efficacy similar to that of the 'standard' tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and imipramine; a meta-analysis of controlled trials found the efficacy of the SSRIs to be equivalent to that of the 2 tricyclics. Nevertheless, because of small patient numbers included in most studies that compare SSRIs with other antidepressants, no definitive statements about relative efficacy can be made. In these studies it is simply possible to state that no statistically significant differences were identified between SSRIs and the comparative antidepressants. Importantly, differences in clinical characteristics exist between the SSRIs-differences in elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) between fluoxetine and/or its metabolite (total t1/2 beta = 330 hours) and other SSRIs (t1/2 beta range = 15 to 30 hours), for example. This has implications in terms of potential drug interactions and must be considered when patients have to be switched to treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Studies with fluvoxamine have been conducted in both in- and outpatients, whereas trials with other SSRIs have been confined largely to outpatient populations. Fluvoxamine has been associated with a high incidence of nausea (37%), although this may have resulted from high initial dosages (rather than upward dose titration protocols) used in early trials. Of further interest, fluoxetine doses of 20mg may be sufficient to produce a satisfactory antidepressant response, and this SSRI may be particularly useful in patients with chronic retarded depression. More clinical data are required before the efficacy of sertraline and citalopram relative to standard antidepressants can be clearly defined. Preliminary data indicate that SSRIs are effective in the treatment of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating (e.g. anorexia and bulimia) and personality disorders (e.g. anger, impulsiveness) and substance abuse (e.g. alcoholism); early results with fluvoxamine in the treatment of panic disorder and OCD, and with fluoxetine in the treatment of bulimia, personality disorders and alcohol abuse, have been encouraging. SSRIs have a more favourable tolerability profile than tricyclic antidepressants and, unlike the tricyclics, are not associated with anticholinergic adverse effects, sedation, cardiotoxicity or weight gain. SSRIs are associated with a relatively high incidence of nausea, particularly if high doses are used at the start of treatment. However, the incidence of nausea appears to decrease as treatment is continued.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which increase serotonin, are recent, notable antidepressant drugs. SSRIs show similar success to other common antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine. Still, since the studies have small patient samples, no definite statements about the relative antidepressant success of SSRIs can be made. In these studies, no difference was identified between SSRIs and other antidepressants. Importantly, SSRIs have differences like effect duration among other antidepressant medications like fluoxetine. This distinct effect duration may alter the drug's success and should be considered when switching patients' treatments. Studies with fluvoxamine (an antidepressant SSRI) occured with patients in and out of hospitals, while studies with other SSRIs occured largely with patients out of hospitals. Using fluvoxamine (an antidepressant drug) may lead to nausea, but this may be due to using high starting doses rather than steadily-increasing dosages for use in early trials. 20 mg of flueoxetine may give a decent antidepressant response and be useful for those with long-lasting, movement-inhibiting depression. More data is needed to define the success of other antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like sertraline and citalopram. SSRIs like fluvoxamine and fluoxetine seem to help treat a variety of mental illnesses other than depression. Patients put up with SSRIs better than other non-SSRI antidepressants and without notable side effects, sleepiness, heart damage, or weight gain. SSRIs can lead to nausea, especially with high starting doses. However, the frequency of nausea may decrease as treatment continues.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a recently developed type of drugs that works better as an antidepressant than a placebo, a type of substance that looks like a real pill but is not the real medicine. In clinical studies, all SSRIs showed that they have similar effectiveness as standard antidepressants that are older types of medicines. However, because of the small patient numbers in most studies that compare SSRIs with other antidepressants, no definite statements on how the effectiveness compares between the two types of drugs can be made. In these studies, it is simply possible to state that no significant differences based on data analysis are identified between SSRIs and the other type of antidepressants they are being compared to. Importantly, differences in medical features and measures exist between the SSRIs, including differences in the time it takes for the amount of the drug in the body to be reduced to half its starting amount between fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) and other SSRIs. The findings from these existing studies may lead to other effects, including how two or more drugs react to one another which must be considered when patients are switched to treatment with an earlier antidepressant. The structure of clinical studies differs between fluvoxamine, which includes inpatients and outpatients, and other SSRIs which mainly take place in outpatient settings. Fluvoxamine is associated with a high frequency of nausea (37%), although this may be the result from patients starting with a high dose that are often used in early trials instead of the standard dose. Additionally, fluoxetine doses of 20mg may be enough to produce a satisfactory antidepressant response, and this SSRI may be particularly useful in patients with chronic retarded depression, a depression disorder where symptoms include slow movement and toneless speech. More clinical data are needed before the effectiveness of sertraline and citalopram (two other SSRIs) relative to standard antidepressants can be clearly defined. Early data suggests that SSRIs are effective in the treatment of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating (e.g. anorexia and bulimia) and personality disorders (e.g. anger, impulsiveness) and substance abuse (e.g. alcoholism). There are encouraging early results with fluvoxamine in the treatment of panic disorder and OCD, and with fluoxetine in the treatment of bulimia, personality disorders and alcohol abuse. Patients are able to handle the side effects of SSRIs better than tricyclic antidepressants and, unlike the tricyclics, SSRIs are not associated with adverse effects of anticholinergic drugs that treat a number of health problems, sedation, damage to the heart, or weight gain. SSRIs are associated with a high count of nausea, particularly if high doses are used at the start of treatment. However, the frequency of nausea appears to decrease as treatment is continued."

Case presentation: A 36-year old fifth gravida patient who had a missed abortion was diagnosed as having a molar pregnancy with beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (βhCG) level of 509,921 IU/L. Her lung field was clear and she underwent suction and curettage (S & C) procedure. However, after six weeks, AA presented to the emergency department with a massive bleeding, although her βhCG level had decreased to 65,770 IU/L. A trans-abdominal ultrasound indicated the presence of an intra-uterine mass (3.0 × 4.4 cm). Nevertheless, her βhCG continued to show a declining trend (8,426 IU/L). AA was advised to undergo a chemotherapy but she refused, citing preference for alternative medicine like herbs instead. She opted for an ""at own risk"" (AOR) discharge with scheduled follow up. Subsequently, her condition improved with her βhCG showing a downward trend. Surprisingly, at six months post S & C, her βhCG ameliorated to 0 IU/L with no mass detected by ultrasound.

She underwent suction and curettage (S & C) procedure, a process that uses a vacuum to remove a fetus. However, after six weeks, AA presented to the emergency department with a massive bleeding. The patient's βhCG level had decreased to 65,770 IU/L. An abdominal ultrasound indicated the presence of an intra-uterine mass. Nevertheless, her βhCG continued to decline. AA was advised to undergo a chemotherapy. The patient refused, citing preference for alternative medicine like herbs instead. She opted for an ""at own risk"" (AOR) discharge with scheduled follow up. Her condition improved with her βhCG showing a downward trend. Surprisingly, at six months following S & C, her βhCG improved to 0 IU/L. No mass was detected by ultrasound. Brucea javanica fruits along with Pereskia bleo Annona muricata leaves can potentially be useful alternatives to chemotherapy. This idea needs further study.",
33,15584938,"Purpose: The pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in paediatric patients with uncontrolled seizures was studied. Methods: Thirteen paediatric patients (mean age: 9.4 years) with uncontrolled partial seizures were included. Patients received gabapentin orally until doses were individualized to 9.6-39.8 mg/kg/day. Blood samples were obtained just prior to the dose and over 8 h after gabapentin was administered in the fasting state. The plasma concentration of gabapentin was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters for gabapentin were determined by non-compartment methods using multivariate regression analysis. Results: Data from nine patients were suitable for pharmacokinetic analysis. The C(max) from 0.9 to 5.8 microg/mL (mean: 2.6 +/- 1.7 microg/mL) and T(max) from 0.5 to 2.0 h (mean: 1.6 +/- 1.0 h). The apparent clearance (Cl/F) ranged from 0.12 to 1.12 L/h/kg (mean: 0.50 +/- 0.29 L/h/kg), and the elimination half-life from 3.2 to 12.2 h (mean: 5.5 +/- 0.8 h). Five patients experienced moderate (n = 4) to severe (n = 1) aggressive behaviour and another gained weight on gabapentin. Conclusions: Our data suggests that gabapentin pharmacokinetics can vary substantially among paediatric patients. Gabapentin was well tolerated in patients with uncontrolled partial seizures up to 6 months of therapy.","How the pediatric or child patients with uncontrolled seizures are able to handle gabapentin (a nerve-related pain medication) and the processes of absorbing, distributing, using, and removing it is studied. In this study, 13 pediatric patients (less the 21 years old) with an average age of about 9 years with uncontrolled partial seizures are included. Patients received gabapentin orally (by mouth) until doses are changed for each patient. Blood samples are obtained just before the dose and over 8 hours after gabapentin is given during fasting, when all foods have been completely digested. Blood concentrations of gabapentin is measured by blood tests. Absorption, distribution, use, and removal of gabapentin in the body is analyzed. Data from 9 patients are able to be used for analysis. The maximum concentration of the drug and the time it takes to reach maximum concentration are estimated. Five patients experience moderate (4 patients) to severe (1 patient) aggressive behavior, and another gained weight on gabapentin. In conclusion, the data in this study suggests that how the body processes gabapentin can vary a lot among pediatric patients. In this study, patients with uncontrolled partial seizures were able to handle gabapentin well up to 6 months of therapy.",
38,31976835,"Background: The biodegradable and biocompatible nature of pectin-based films is of particular interest in wound dressing applications, due to its non-toxicity, pH-sensitivity and gelling activity. An approach to improve the mechanical properties, the release profile of bioactive compounds as well as the performance in wet environments of pectin-based films is mixing with other biopolymers. Objective: To prepare hydrocolloid films based on crosslinked pectin / starch blend loaded with bioactive extracts from leaves of G. tinctoria and U. molinae with controlled release of bioactive compounds and healing property. Methods: The hydrocolloid films were characterized by FTIR, SEM, and TGA-FTIR techniques and their tensile properties, water uptake, and polyphenolic release profile in aqueous media were evaluated. The dermal anti inflammatory activity of the hydrocolloid films was assessed by the mouse ear inflammation test. The wound healing property of the loaded hydrocolloid films was explored in a rat model and in a clinical trial (sacrum pressure ulcer). Results: The films showed an adequate water-uptake capacity between 100-160%. The release of active compounds from the hydrocolloid films followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation. The mechanical properties of hydrocolloid films were not affected by the plant extracts within the concentration range used. The incorporation of the bioactive extracts in the polysaccharide films inhibited the topical edematous response by about 50%. The topical application of the loaded hydrocolloid film on the pressure ulcer is completely closed after 17 days without showing any adverse reaction. Conclusion: A novel hydrocolloid matrix was produced from crosslinked starch-pectin, which exhibited suitable chemical-physical properties to be used as a carrier of plant extracts with wound healing properties.","The recycability of pectin-based films (thin strips of plant-based fiber) is of interest in wound bandaging, due to its non-toxicity, acid-sensitivity, and gel-like nature. One idea to improve the function, bioactive composition, and performance when wet of pectin-based films is mixing it with other biological molecules. Our objective is to create waterproof films based on a pectin/starch blend with specific plant extracts that have controlled release of bioactive and healing substances. The molecular composition of the waterproof films were measured with specific tools. We also measured the tension strength, water uptake, and bioactive molecules released in water. The skin-related anti-inflammatory activity of the waterproof films was measured by testing its anti-inflammatory eactivity on an inflammed mouse ear. We tested the healing effects of the active waterproof films with rats and human bedsores. The films showed an acceptable water-uptake capacity between 100-160%. The release of biological compounds from the waterproof films followed a standard drug-release trend. The function of the waterproof films was not affected by the plant extracts within the amounts used. Adding plant extracts into the films blocked the skin swelling by around 50%. The application of the active waterproof film on the surface of the bedsore is closed after 17 days without any side effects. A new waterproof film was created from a starch-pectin blend, with suitable chemical-physical properties to carry plant extracts with wound healing effects.","Pectin-based films are wrapping that is made from pectin, a substance extracted from ripe fruits. Pectin-based films are biodegradable and biocompatible. Additionally, the films are non-toxic, are pH (acid-base) sensitive, and have gelling activity. These qualities make the films of interest in wound dressing. In order to improve how the films responsd to stress and strain, specifically how the material holds up when wet, other biopolymers could be mixed with the pectin-based films. Biopolymers are substances that are found within living organisms, just like pectin is found in fruit. The aim of this study was the prepare hydrocolloid (gel-forming) films using a pectin and starch blend with extracts from two different leaves. The film was made to have a controlled release of bioactive compounds and healing properties. Bioactive compounds are components of food that influence biological or cellular activity within humans or animals that eat them. The hydrocolloid films were tested for their tensile strength (resistance to tension breakage), water uptake, and polyphenolic release profile in wet environments. Polyphenols are compounds with various biological properties, including anti-inflammatory (anti-swelling and -redness from an infection) and antioxidant. The skin anti-inflammatory activity of the hydrocolloid films was assessed (measured) by a test evaluating inflammation on a mouse ear. The wound healing property of the hydrocolloid films was explored in a rat model. The wound healing property was also explored in a human clinical trial looking at lower back pressure ulcers (skin sores). The films showed an adequate water-uptake capacity between 100-160%. The release of active compounds from the hydrocolloid films followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation, which implies that release of healing properties was controlled over time. The mechanical properties of the hydrocolloid films, or how they respond to stress, were not affected by the plant extracts. Addition of the same bioactive extracts in a carbohydrate-based film significantly decreased the topical edematous response or the accumulation of watery fluid. Applying the loaded hydrocolloid film on the pressure ulcer completely closed the wound after 17 days without any negative side effects. The study concluded that a novel (new) hydrocolloid mixture was produced from starch and pectin. This mixture showed suitable chemical-physical properties to act as a carrier of plant extracts with wound healing properties."

35,28634907,"Background: Existing guidelines for repeat screening and treatment monitoring intervals regarding the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans are conflicting or lacking. The Choosing Wisely campaign recommends against repeating DXA scans within 2 years of initial screening. It is unclear how frequently physicians order repeat scans and what clinical factors contribute to their use. Objective: To estimate cumulative incidence and predictors of repeat DXA for screening or treatment monitoring in a regional health system. Design: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5992 women aged 40-84 years who received initial DXA screening from 2006 to 2011 within a regional health system in Sacramento, CA. Main measures: Two- and five-year cumulative incidence and hazard rations (HR) of repeat DXA by initial screening result (classified into three groups: low or high risk of progression to osteoporosis, or osteoporosis) and whether women were prescribed osteoporosis drugs after initial DXA. Key results: Among women not treated after initial DXA, 2-year cumulative incidence for low-risk, high-risk, and osteoporotic women was 8.0%, 13.8%, and 19.6%, respectively, increasing to 42.9%, 60.4%, and 57.4% by 5 years after initial screening. For treated women, median time to repeat DXA was over 3 years for all groups. Relative to women with low-risk initial DXA, high-risk initial DXA significantly predicted repeat screening for untreated women [adjusted HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.40-2.00)] but not within the treated group [HR 1.09 (95% CI 0.91-1.30)]. Conclusions: Repeat DXA screening was common in women both at low and high risk of progression to osteoporosis, with a substantial proportion of women receiving repeat scans within 2 years of initial screening. Conversely, only 60% of those at high-risk of progression to osteoporosis were re-screened within 5 years. Interventions are needed to help clinicians make higher-value decisions regarding repeat use of DXA scans.","Current guidelines disagree or do not exist for how long to wait between checks and treatment check-ins involving the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, a technique used by doctors to measure a patient's risk of osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle). A campaign to avoid unnecessary medical tests, treatments and procedures does not suggest DXA scans within 2 years of the first test. How often and for which patient characteristics doctors order repeat scans is unclear. We aim to estimate the number of people at risk who develop osteoporosis over a period and predictors of repeat DXA for checks and treatment check-ins in a healthcare facility. We studied 5992 women aged 40-84 years who underwent DXA scans to check for osteoporosis from 2006 to 2011 at a healthcare facility in Sacramento, CA. Main test scores included two- and five-year amounts and risks of repeat DXA by initial test results (classified into three groups: low or high risk of worsening to osteoporosis, or osteoporosis) and whether women were given osteoporosis drugs after the first DXA. For women not treated after a first DXA, 2-year amounts for low-risk, high-risk, and osteoporotic women were 8.0%, 13.8%, and 19.6%, respectively, increasing to 42.9%, 60.4%, and 57.4% by 5 years after the first screening. For treated women, average time to repeat DXA was over 3 years for all groups. Compared to women with low-risk initial DXA, high-risk initial DXA significantly led to repeat screening for untreated women but not within the treated group. Conclusions: Repeat DXA screening was common in women both at low and high risk of worsening to osteoporosis, with a large amount of women receiving repeat scans within 2 years of initial screening. On the other hand, only 60% of those at high-risk of worsening or progression to osteoporosis were re-screened within 5 years. Treatments are needed to help clinicians make better decisions regarding repeat use of DXA scans.",

35,26086766,"Background: To develop an OSTAi tool and compare this with the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommendations in 2013 (NOF 2013) for bone mineral density (BMD) testing among Taiwan postmenopausal women. Methods: Taiwan Osteoporosis Association (TOA) conducted a nationwide BMD survey by a bus installed with a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) between 2008 and 2011. All of the participants completed questionnaire, which included demographics and risk factors of osteoporotic fracture in FRAX tool. We used the database to analyze potential risk factors for osteoporosis and followed the model by Koh et al. to develop a risk index via multiple variable regression analysis and item reduction. We used the index values to set up a simple algorithm (namely OSTAi) to identify those who need BMD measurement. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare the sensitivity/specificity analysis of this model with that of recommendations by NOF 2013. Results: A total of 12,175 Taiwan postmenopausal women enrolled in this survey. The index value was derived by age and body weight of the participants according to weighted odds of each risk factor and the selected cutoff value was set at ""-1"". There are 6393 (52.5%) participants whose index value is below ""-1"" and whose risk of osteoporosis was 57.5% (3674/6393).

45,31241491,"Background: Effect of nifedipine on pressure ulcer (PU) healing has not been evaluated in the human subjects yet. Study question: In this study, the effect of topical application of nifedipine 3% ointment on PU healing in critically ill patients was investigated. Study design: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical. Measures and outcomes: In this study, 200 patients with stage I or II PU according to 2-digit Stirling Pressure Ulcer Severity Scale were randomized to receive topical nifedipine 3% ointment or placebo twice daily for 14 days. Changes in the size and stage of the ulcers were considered as primary outcome of the study. The stage of the ulcers at baseline and on day 7 and day 14 of study was determined by using 2-digit stirling scale. In addition, the surface area of the wounds was estimated by multiplying width by length. Results: In total, 83 patients in each group completed the study. The groups were matched for the baseline stage and size of PUs. Mean decrease in the stage of PU in the nifedipine group was significantly higher than the placebo group on day 7 (-1.71 vs. -0.16, respectively, P < 0.001) and day 14 (-0.78 vs. -0.09, respectively, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the mean decrease in the surface area of PU was significantly higher in the nifedipine group compared with the placebo group on day 7 (-1.44 vs. -0.32, respectively, P < 0.001) and day 14 (-2.51 vs. -0.24, respectively, P < 0.001) of study. Conclusions: Topical application of nifedipine 3% ointment for 14 days significantly improved the healing process of stage I or II PUs in critically ill patients.","Scientists have not yet measured the effect of nifedipine, a drug to treat high blood pressure and chest pain, on bedsores in humans. In this study, we looked at the effect of applying nifedipine 3% ointment to the skin on bedsore healing in critically ill patients.

In this study, we randomly gave 200 patients with stage I or II, according to a common scoring system to measure the severity of bedsores, nifedipine ointment applied to the skin or ointment with no medicine two times a day for 14 days. The most important outcome was changes in the size and stage of bedsores. We used the bedsore scoring scale to measure bedsore stage at the beginning of the study and on study days 7 and 14. We estimated the surface area of the bedsores by multiplying width by length. In total, 83 patients in each group completed the study. We compared patients with similar bedsore stage and size at the beginning of the study. The group given nifedipine had significantly higher average decrease in bedsore stage than the group not given nifedipine on days 7 and 14. The group given nifedipine had significantly higher average decrease in bedsore surface area than the group not given nifedipine on days 7 and 14.

Recent studies document very common occurrences of atrial fibrillation (an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm that can lead to blood clots in the heart) and their association with obesity and other risk factors for atrial fibrillation. In addition, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a device to help people with OSA breathe more easily while sleeping, prevent atrial fibrillation from returning after cardioversion (a procedure used to return an irregular or very fast heartbeat to a normal rhythm).

44,30573009,"Background: A severe mismatch between the supply and demand of oxygen is the common feature of all types of shock. We present a newly developed, clinically oriented classification of the various types of shock and their therapeutic implications. Results: There are only four major categories of shock, each of which is mainly related to one of four organ systems. Hypovolemic shock relates to the blood and fluids compartment while distributive shock relates to the vascular system; cardiogenic shock arises from primary cardiac dysfunction; and obstructive shock arises from a blockage of the circulation. Hypovolemic shock is due to intravascular volume loss and is treated by fluid replacement with balanced crystalloids. Distributive shock, on the other hand, is a state of relative hypovolemia resulting from pathological redistribution of the absolute intravascular volume and is treated with a combination of vasoconstrictors and fluid replacement. Cardiogenic shock is due to inadequate function of the heart, which shall be treated, depending on the situation, with drugs, surgery, or other interventional procedures. In obstructive shock, hypoperfusion due to elevated resistance shall be treated with an immediate life-saving intervention. Pathogenesis and pathophysiology: The characteristic feature of both, hemorrhagic and traumatic hemorrhagic shock is bleeding. However, differences exist between the two subcategories in terms of the extent of soft tissue damage. Clinically the most significant cause of hemorrhagic shock is acute bleeding from an isolated injury to a large blood vessel, gastrointestinal bleeding, nontraumatic vascular rupture (e.g., aortic aneurysm), obstetric hemorrhage (e.g., uterine atony), and hemorrhage in the region of the ear, nose, and throat (vascular erosion). The shock is triggered by the critical drop in circulating blood volume; massive loss of red blood cells intensifies the tissue hypoxia.","Inequality between the supply and demand of oxygen is the common feature of shock. This study presents a newly developed, patient-treatment oriented classification of the various types of shock and their therapeutic (helpful) implications. There are four major categories of shock. Each category is mainly related to one of four organ systems. One category, known as hypovolemic shock, relates to the blood and fluids compartment. Distributive shock relates to the vascular system or blood vessels. Cardiogenic shock arises from primary cardiac or heart dysfunction. Obstructive shock arises from a blockage of circulation. Hypovolemic shock is due to volume loss with blood vessels or blood vascular system. This type of shock is treated by replacement with balanced fluids. Distributive shock is a state of low blood plasma. This type of shock comes from volume displacement in blood vessels. It is treated with a combination of vasoconstrictors, drugs that constrict blood vessels to increase blood pressure, and fluid replacement. Cardiogenic shock is caused by inadequate function of the heart, which shall be treated, depending on the situation, with drugs, surgery, or other treatment methods. In obstructive shock, circulatory failure due to increased resistance will be treated with an immediate life-saving intervention. Both hemorrhagic (excessive bleeding from a ruptured blood vessel) and traumatic hemorrhagic (internal bleeding from an injury) shock feature bleeding. However, differences exist between the two subcategories in terms of how much soft tissue damage they create. The most significant cause of hemorrhagic shock is bleeding from an isolated injury to a critical portion of the body.

Participants: Participants included 60 consecutive consenting subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admitted to hospital: 13 without known diabetes admitted for other indications and not treated with glucocorticoids (group 1), 40 without known diabetes admitted with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and treated with prednisolone (group 2, prednisolone = 30 ± 6 mg/d), and seven with known diabetes treated with prednisolone (group 3, prednisolone = 26 ± 9 mg/d). Main outcome measure: Interstitial glucose concentration was assessed during continuous glucose monitoring. Results: Significantly more subjects in group 2 [21 of 40 (53%), P = 0.02] and group 3 [seven of seven (100%), P = 0.003] recorded a glucose of at least 200 mg/dl (≥11.1 mmol/liter) during continuous glucose monitoring than in group 1 [one of 13 (8%)]. The mean glucose concentration between 2400-1200 h for group 3 (142 ± 36 mg/dl) was significantly greater than in the other two groups (P < 0.005), whereas mean glucose concentrations between 2400-1200 h in group 1 (108 ± 16 mg/dl) and group 2 (112 ± 22 mg/dl) were not significantly different. In contrast, the mean glucose concentrations between 1200-2400 h for group 2 (142 ± 25 mg/dl) and group 3 (189 ± 32 mg/dl) were both significantly greater than group 1 (117 ± 14 mg/dl, P < 0.05 for both comparisons). Conclusions: Prednisolone predominantly causes hyperglycemia in the afternoon and evening. Treatment of prednisolone-induced hyperglycemia should be targeted at this time period.","Endogenous glucocorticoid excess (Cushing's syndrome) is caused when the body has too much of the stress hormone cortisol over a long period of time. It increases the level of blood sugar concentration up to 4 hours after eating a meal. The pattern of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) caused by prednisolone, a steroid drug made to act like the cortisol hormone, has not been well described. The objective of this study is to define the 24 hour effect of prednisolone on blood sugar concentration to help manage hyperglycemia brought about by prednisolone. This study takes place in a teaching hospital. Participants include 60 people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease making it difficult to breathe, admitted to the hospital and placed into groups. Thirteen participants (group 1) without known diabetes are admitted for other problems and not treated with glucocorticoids, drugs used to fight inflammation (effects of infection-fighting). Forty participants without known diabetes are admitted with an extreme COPD and treated with prednisolone (group 2). Seven participants with known diabetes are treated with prednisolone (group 3). Interstitial glucose concentration is taken from the fluid surrounding the cells of tissues rather the blood and is assessed (measured) during continuous glucose monitoring that regularly check sugar levels. Significantly more participants in group 2 and group 3 recorded a glucose of at least 200 mg/dl during continuous glucose monitoring than in group 1. The average glucose concentration between midnight and noon (2400-1200 hours) for group 3 is much greater than in the other two groups, whereas the average glucose concentrations between midnight and noon (2400-1200 hours) in group 1 and group 2 are not significantly different. In contrast, the average glucose concentrations between noon and midnight (1200-2400 hours) for group 2 and group 3 ae both much greater than group 1. Prednisolone mainly causes hyperglycemia in the afternoon and evening. Treatment of hyperglycemia that is brought on by prednisolone should be targeted at this time period.",
14,34507112,"The COVID-19 epidemic is the greatest pandemic that human kind experienced for decades, with high morbidity and mortality. Despite recent development of vaccines there is still many severe cases of COVID-19. Unfortunately there is still no standardized therapies and treatment of severe cases is very challenging. The aim of this study is to indicate if herbs administered alone or as a complementary therapy could be used as prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Over 85% of patients with COVID-19 in China used Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and a most common herb is Glycyrrhiza glabra, which in vitro inhibits replication of different enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses. Glycyrrhizin in vitro connects and changes conformation of ACE2 receptors, which are vital for SARS-CoV-2 penetration into host cells. Pelargonium sidoides show immunomodulatory and antiviral properties in clinical and in vitro studies, and it inhibits replication of HCo-229E coronavirus. Glycyrrhiza glabra in combination with standard therapies significantly reduces the hospitalization rate and occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms. As complementary therapies lianhuaqingwen capsules and jinhua qinggan granules reduces hospitalization rates, time to symptoms recovery and improve patient psychological comfort. In view of SARS-CoV-2 other herbs are not effective, e.g. maxingshigan-yinqiaosan, or therapeutic concentration would be impossible to achieve, e.g. ephedra herb, or there is simply no proper data. Therefore, Liquorice and Pelargonium sidoides are effective against coronaviruses and could be possibly used as prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19, while lianhuaqingwen capsules and jinhua qinggan granules can be useful as a complementary therapy to conventional treatment.","The COVID-19 epidemic (an outbreak of the viral breathing-related disorder) is the greatest pandemic that human kind experienced for decades, with high numbers of death and illness. Despite recent development of vaccines, there are still many severe cases of COVID-19. Unfortunately, there is still no standard or routine therapy and treatment for these severe cases. This study aims to find out if herbs given by themselves or as part of a combination of treatments can be used to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection (the novel coronavirus that can lead to COVID-19). A very common herb is Glycyrrhiza glabra (a root also known as liquorice), which in vitro (experiments in test tubes) stops or slows replication of different viruses, including coronaviruses. In experiments outside of the body, liquorice connects and changes the structure of ACE2 receptors, which are proteins that allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells. Pelargonium sidoides (an herb from a plant also known as African geranium) is able to change the response of the immune system and has antiviral (infection fighting) properties in clinical and lab studies. It slows or stops replication of HCo-229E coronavirus, a type of coronavirus that infects humans and bats. Glycyrrhiza glabra, or liquorice, in combination with standard therapies significantly reduces hospitalizations and occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms. Additional therapies based on a traditional Chinese medicine, lianhuaqingwen capsules and jinhua qinggan granules, reduces the number of hospitalizations and the time it takes to recover from symptoms. There are some herbs that are either not effective, would be impossible to get enough of into the body safely, or are not usefully documented to fight SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, Liquorice and Pelargonium sidoides are effective against coronaviruses and could be possibly used as prevention and treatment of COVID-19, while lianhuaqingwen capsules and jinhua qinggan granules can be useful as an additional therapy to standard treatment.",
40,11034749,"Background: Up to 1% of adults will suffer from leg ulceration at some time. The majority of leg ulcers are venous in origin and are caused by high pressure in the veins due to blockage or weakness of the valves in the veins of the leg. Prevention and treatment of venous ulcers is aimed at reducing the pressure either by removing / repairing the veins, or by applying compression bandages / stockings to reduce the pressure in the veins. The vast majority of venous ulcers are healed using compression bandages. Once healed they often recur and so it is customary to continue applying compression in the form of bandages, tights, stockings or socks in order to prevent recurrence. Compression bandages or hosiery (tights, stockings, socks) are often applied for ulcer prevention. Objectives: To assess the effects of compression hosiery (socks, stockings, tights) or bandages in preventing the recurrence of venous ulcers. To determine whether there is an optimum pressure/type of compression to prevent recurrence of venous ulcers. Main results: No trials compared recurrence rates with and without compression. One trial (300 patients) compared high (UK Class 3) compression hosiery with moderate (UK Class 2) compression hosiery. A intention to treat analysis found no significant reduction in recurrence at five years follow up associated with high compression hosiery compared with moderate compression hosiery (relative risk of recurrence 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.12). This analysis would tend to underestimate the effectiveness of the high compression hosiery because a significant proportion of people changed from high compression to medium compression hosiery. Compliance rates were significantly higher with medium compression than with high compression hosiery. One trial (166 patients) found no difference in recurrence between two types of medium (UK Class 2) compression hosiery (relative risk of recurrence with Medi was 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 1.2). Both trials reported that not wearing compression hosiery was strongly associated with ulcer recurrence and this is circumstantial evidence that compression reduces ulcer recurrence. No trials were found which evaluated compression bandages for preventing ulcer recurrence. Reviewer's conclusions: No trials compared compression with vs no compression for prevention of ulcer recurrence. Not wearing compression was associated with recurrence in both studies identified in this review. This is circumstantial evidence of the benefit of compression in reducing recurrence. Recurrence rates may be lower in high compression hosiery than in medium compression hosiery and therefore patients should be offered the strongest compression with which they can comply. Further trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of hosiery prescribed in other settings, i.e. in the UK community, in countries other than the UK.","Up to 1% of adults will suffer from leg ulceration (leg sores) at some time. The majority of leg ulcers come from issues within veins. They are caused by high pressure in the veins due to blockage or weakness of the valves in the veins of the leg that prevent backflow or reverse blood flow. Prevention and treatment of venous ulcers is aimed at reducing the pressure. This is achieved by removing or repairing the veins. It can also be achieved by applying compression material to reduce vein pressure. Most venous ulcers are healed using compression bandages. Once healed, they often recur or reappear.

None of the reviewed reports compared recurrence rates with and without compression. One trial (300 patients) compared high compression hosiery with moderate compression hosiery. No significant reduction in recurrence at five years follow up was associated with high compression hosiery when compared with moderate compression hosiery. This may underestimate the effectiveness of the high compression hosiery as a large proportion of people changed from high compression to medium compression hosiery.

One trial found no difference in recurrence between two types of medium compression hosiery. Both trials reported that not wearing compression hosiery was strongly associated with ulcer recurrence. This is circumstantial evidence that compression reduces ulcer recurrence. No studies that evaluated compression bandages for preventing ulcer recurrence were found. The authors concluded on several points following this evidence review. First, no trials compared compression with no compression for prevention of reoccurring ulcers. Second, not wearing compression was associated with ulcer reoccurrence. This is circumstantial evidence of the benefit of compression in reducing recurrence. Third, recurrence rates may be lower if patients wear high compression hosiery over medium compression hosiery. Because of this, patients should be offered the strongest compression they can tolerate. Lastly, further studies are needed to understand the effectiveness of hosiery utilized in alternative locations.",
54,30848135,"Objective: To examine patients after embryo transfer for predictive influence of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level on the probability of finishing pregnancy with delivery. Methods: 490 patients pregnant after IVF + ET treatment placed in the study. The influence of other factors: age (patients 20-50), number of transferred embryos (one, two and more) and the length of cultivation on the probability of finishing pregnancy with delivery or loss and the possibility to predict multiple pregnancy was also related to the known hCG value. The transferred embryos were divided into two groups - early (cultivation 48 and 72 hrs) and prolonged cultivation (PC 96 and 120 hrs). The answer here, therefore, is a multinomial variable with four levels. For that reason the data was analysed through a multinomial logistic model vs. multinomial distribution of a mistake and generalised logistic link function. Results: The hCG level grows exponentially in the course of the 9th to 17th day after an embryo transfer (ET). The probability of one child delivery after the transfer of one embryo overdue after prolonged cultivation (96 or 120 hrs) grows with the average and above-average hCG values on the day of the draw. The hCG value was 678 (564-815) IU/l1 on the 14th day after ET in pregnancy ended in delivery, 321 (216-477) IU/l on average in abortion, 82 (51-132) IU/l in biochemical pregnancy and 1070 (737-1554) IU/l in multiple pregnancy. The probability of multiple pregnancy increased with hCG values greatly above the average and on the other hand, below-average values indicated abortion or biochemical pregnancy. The patients age was not proven to be of significant influence, the hCG level slightly decreased with higher age. On the contrary, an increasing frequency of abortions depending on the increasing age of the mother was once again confirmed. Conclusion: The measured hCG values are considerably different depending on the pregnancy result, which is why this value is considered a quality predictive factor of the pregnancy result.","This study examined patients after embryo transfer.

52,32489015,"47,XXX (triple X) and Turner syndrome (45,X) are sex chromosomal abnormalities with detrimental effects on health with increased mortality and morbidity. In karyotypical normal females, X-chromosome inactivation balances gene expression between sexes and upregulation of the X chromosome in both sexes maintain stoichiometry with the autosomes. In 47,XXX and Turner syndrome a gene dosage imbalance may ensue from increased or decreased expression from the genes that escape X inactivation, as well as from incomplete X chromosome inactivation in 47,XXX. We aim to study genome-wide DNA-methylation and RNA-expression changes can explain phenotypic traits in 47,XXX syndrome. We compare DNA-methylation and RNA-expression data derived from white blood cells of seven women with 47,XXX syndrome, with data from seven female controls, as well as with seven women with Turner syndrome (45,X). To address these questions, we explored genome-wide DNA-methylation and transcriptome data in blood from seven females with 47,XXX syndrome, seven females with Turner syndrome, and seven karyotypically normal females (46,XX). Based on promoter methylation, we describe a demethylation of six X-chromosomal genes (AMOT, HTR2C, IL1RAPL2, STAG2, TCEANC, ZNF673), increased methylation for GEMIN8, and four differentially methylated autosomal regions related to four genes (SPEG, MUC4, SP6, and ZNF492). We illustrate how these changes seem compensated at the transcriptome level although several genes show differential exon usage. In conclusion, our results suggest an impact of the supernumerary X chromosome in 47,XXX syndrome on the methylation status of selected genes despite an overall comparable expression profile.","47,XXX (triple X) and Turner syndrome (45,X) are sex chromosomal (gene material) abnormalities with detrimental effects on health. Both syndromes are associated with increased death and disease suffering. In females with normal chromosomes, X-chromosome (sex chromosome) inactivation balances gene expression between sexes. Upregulation (increase in activity) of the X chromosome in both sexes maintains balance with the autosomes (chromosomes not involved in sex determination). In both syndromes, a gene dosage imbalance may be caused by increased or decreased expression from the genes that escape X inactivation. A gene dosage imbalance may also be caused by incomplete X chromosome inactivation in 47,XXX. This study aimed to evaluate genome-wide DNA-methylation (addition of methyl groups to DNA) and RNA (genetic material)-expression changes. This was done in the hope that these alterations may explain phenotypic traits, or observable character traits, associated with 47,XXX syndrome.

21,34186459,"Introduction and importance: A Littre's hernia (LH) is defined by the presence of Meckel's diverticulum (MD) in any kind of hernia sac. Preoperative diagnosis of LH is a challenge because of its rarity and the absence of specific radiological findings and clinical presentation. Surgery is the appropriate treatment of complicated LH that is an extremely rare condition with approximately 50 cases reported in the literature over the past 300 years. Case presentation: A 46-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed an irreducible and painfull mass in umbilical region. Abdominal computed tomography scan showed the protrusion of greater omentum and small bowel loop through the umbilical ring. Laboratory tests were unremarkable. After diagnosis of strangulated umbilical hernia, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy: the irreducible umbilical hernial sac was opened with presence of incarcerated and strangulated omentum and uncomplicated MD. Resection of incarcerated and ischemic greater omentum alone was performed. The postoperative course of patient was uneventful. Clinical discussion: Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a vestigial remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, representing the most common congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract. Preoperative diagnosis of LH is very difficult and surgery represents the correct treatment of complicated LH. Conclusion: LH represents an extremely rare complication of MD difficult to diagnose and suspect because of the lack of specific radiological findings and clinical presentation. Surgery represents the appropriate treatment of abdominal wall hernias and complicated MD.","A Littre's hernia (LH) is characterized by Meckel's diverticulum (MD; a pouch on the wall of the lower part of the small intestine present at birth) in any kind of hernia or bulging organ sac. Diagnosing LH before surgery is difficult because it is rare and lacks distinguishing features on x-ray and exam. Surgery is the best treatment for inflamed LH, a very rare condition with about 50 cases reported in scientific papers over the past 300 years. A 46-year-old white woman went to the emergency room after two days of stomach pain. Physical exam showed an irreversible and painful lump near the belly button. Stomach CT scan showed the tissue that covers the intestines and loop of the small intestine pushing out through the muscle that surrounds the belly button. Lab tests were normal. After diagnosis of a hernia near the belly button cutting off blood supply, the patient had abdominal surgery. Doctors opened the irreversible hernia sac and saw tissue that covers the intestines trapped and cut off from blood supply along with uninflamed MD. Parts of the tissue that covers the intestines that were trapped or cut off from blood supply and were removed. The patient recovered normally from surgery. MD is the most common abnormality of the GI tract present at birth. Diagnosing LH before surgery is difficult and surgery is the best treatment of inflamed LH. We conclude that LH is a very rare complication of MD and is difficult to diagnose because it lacks distinguishing features on x-ray and exam. Surgery is the best treatment for stomach wall hernias and inflamed MD.",
37,32377769,"Pregabalin abuse has become an emerging concern; thus, the current study has been designed to study the neurotoxic hazards of prolonged high-dose of pregabalin (akin to that abused by addicts) and to evaluate the effect of alpha tocopherol as a possible ameliorating agent. The current study evaluated the brain neurotransmitters; dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine. The study also assessed the expression of the apoptosis-related markers Bax, Bcl2, and caspase 3. Western-blotted analysis of the three major mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), the p38 MAPK, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), has also been performed. The study also evaluated oxidative stress via assessment of the cortical tissue levels of reduced glutathione and malondialdehyde and the activity of superoxide dismutase. Histopathological examination and histomorphometric evaluation of the darkly degenerated cortical neurons have also been performed. Pregabalin in high doses (150 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day) disrupted the ERK/JNK/p38-MAPK signaling, reversed the bax/bcl2 ratio, and induced oxidative stress. It also diminished the release of dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine and increased the count of degenerated neurons. Alpha tocopherol treatment significantly attenuated the deleterious effects induced by pregabalin. The role of alpha tocopherol in ameliorating the oxidative stress injury, and apoptosis induced by pregabalin, along with its role in normalizing neurotransmitters, modulating the ERK/JNK/p38-MAPK signaling pathways and improving the histopathological cortical changes, offers alpha tocopherol as a promising adjunctive therapy in patients undergoing prolonged pregabalin therapy as those suffering from prolonged seizures and neuropathies.","Pregabalin, a drug often used to treat nerve damage, abuse has become an emerging concern. The current study aimed to investigate nervous system (brain and spinal cord) damage caused by prolonged high-dose of pregabalin. This dose is similar to that used by addicts. Additionally, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of alpha tocopherol, a type of Vitamin E, as a possible agent to help side effects. The study evaluated the brain neurotransmitters; dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers in the body. The study also assessed (measured) the expression of the cell death-related markers Bax, Bcl2, and caspase 3. Additional tests evaluating three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) was completed. MAPKs are involved in biological pathways that direct cell response to mitogens, or things that induce cell division. The study also evaluated oxidative stress which is an imbalance between production and accumulation of harmful oxygen reactive species. Evaluations of the degenerated cortical neurons, nerve cells within the brain, were also preformed. Pregabalin in high doses (150 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day) disrupted the signaling for cellular processes, reversed ratios of proteins needed for cell cycles, and induced oxidative stress. It also diminished the release of neurotransmitters and increased the count of degenerated neurons. Alpha tocopherol treatment significantly reduced the harmful effects induced by pregabalin. Alpha tocopherol plays a role in reducing negative side effects induced by pregabalin. It also normalizes neurotransmitter levels, positively effects signaling pathways for cell function, and improves cortical (brain) structure changes. These reasons make alpha tocopherol a promising therapeutic option in patients undergoing prolonged pregabalin therapy.",
36,32809722,"Renal stones pose a significant burden on the health care system. The prevalence of renal stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the United States, with annual healthcare costs of USD 3.8 billion. It is estimated that more than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone problems. The most common presenting symptoms include hematuria, pain in the flank, groin, or abdomen. There are many treatment modalities available for managing renal stones. They range from completely non-invasive outpatient procedures to invasive procedures requiring hospital admission and increased risks of complications. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a truly non-invasive procedure as opposed to other surgical treatments used, such as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). The efficacy of ESWL lies in its ability to pulverize calculi in vivo into smaller segments, which are them expelled spontaneously by the boy. Shockwaves are generated and are then focused on a point within the body. The shockwaves propagate through the body with minimal dissipation of energy (and therefore damage) due to minimal difference in density of the soft tissues. At the stone fluid interface, a relatively significant difference in density, combined with a large concentration of multiple shockwaves in a small area, produces a significant dissipation of energy. Through the different mechanisms, this energy can overcome the tensile strength of the stone resulting in fragmentation. Repetition of this process leads to the pulverization of the stone into small fragments that the body then can pass painlessly and spontaneously.","Kidney stones are a major burden on the health care system. The number of kidney stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the United States, and yearly healthcare costs are at $3.8 billion. It is estimated that more than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone problems. The most common symptoms include blood in the urine, pain in the back and sides, groin, or stomach area (abdomen). There are many treatment methods available for managing kidney stones. These options range from non-invasive (non-surgical) outpatient procedures that do not require hospital stays to invasive (surgical) procedures requiring staying in the hospital and an increased risk of complications. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a truly non-invasive procedure as opposed to other surgical treatments used, such as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) that require an incision into the skin. ESWL is effective because it can crush stones inside the body into smaller parts, which are then released from the body when going to the bathroom. Shockwaves are generated and focused on a point within the body. The shockwaves go through the body with little damage to surrounding tissues. When the stone changes, there is a big difference in the density of the stone which may produce a larger reach of energy due to a lot of shockwaves in a small area of the body. This energy can overpower the strength of the stone, resulting in breaking the stone into smaller parts. Repeating this process leads to the pulverizing of the stone into small fragments that the body can then pass through the body with no pain.","Kidney stones are a major burden on health care. The proportion of cases of kidney stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the United States, with yearly healthcare costs of 3.8 billion US dollars. More than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone issues. The most common symptoms are blood in the urine and pain at or near the abdomen. There are many treatment options for kidney stones. They range from non-surgical away-from-hospital treatments to surgical procedures needing hospital care and increased risks of side effects. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), or kidney stone removal with shockwaves, is a truly non-srugical procedure compared to other surgical treatments like kidney surgery with a camera tube and making a small skin cut to remove stones. The success of ESWL comes from pulverizing stones into small stones, which are removed naturally by the body. Shockwaves are created and focused on a point in the body. The shockwaves spread through the body with minimal loss of energy (and therefore damage) due to small density or hardness differences of the surrounding body parts. At the boundary between the stone and body fluid, a large difference in hardness, along with many shockwaves in one area, creates a large burst of energy. Via different mechanisms, this energy can break up the stone. Repeating this process pulverzies the stone into small fragments that the body can remove painlessly and naturally."
45,28639707,"Background: Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both. Dressings are widely used to treat pressure ulcers and promote healing, and there are many options to choose from including alginate, hydrocolloid and protease-modulating dressings. Topical agents have also been used as alternatives to dressings in order to promote healing. A clear and current overview of all the evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding the use of dressings or topical agents for the treatment of pressure ulcers. Such a review would ideally help people with pressure ulcers and health professionals assess the best treatment options. This review is a network meta-analysis (NMA) which assesses the probability of complete ulcer healing associated with alternative dressings and topical agents. Main results: We included 51 studies (2947 participants) in this review and carried out NMA in a network of linked interventions for the sole outcome of probability of complete healing. The network included 21 different interventions (13 dressings, 6 topical agents and 2 supplementary linking interventions) and was informed by 39 studies in 2127 participants, of whom 783 had completely healed wounds. We judged the network to be sparse: overall, there were relatively few participants, with few events, both for the number of interventions and the number of mixed treatment contrasts; most studies were small or very small. The consequence of this sparseness is high imprecision in the evidence, and this, coupled with the (mainly) high risk of bias in the studies informing the network, means that we judged the vast majority of the evidence to be of low or very low certainty. We have no confidence in the findings regarding the rank order of interventions in this review (very low-certainty evidence), but we report here a summary of results for some comparisons of interventions compared with saline gauze. We present here only the findings from evidence which we did not consider to be very low certainty, but these reported results should still be interpreted in the context of the very low certainty of the network as a whole. It is not clear whether regimens involving protease-modulating dressings increase the probability of pressure ulcer healing compared with saline gauze (risk ratio (RR) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 2.94) (moderate-certainty evidence: low risk of bias, downgraded for imprecision). This risk ratio of 1.65 corresponds to an absolute difference of 102 more people healed with protease modulating dressings per 1000 people treated than with saline gauze alone (95% CI 13 fewer to 302 more). It is unclear whether the following interventions increase the probability of healing compared with saline gauze (low-certainty evidence): collagenase ointment (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.22); foam dressings (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.26); basic wound contact dressings (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.58) and polyvinylpyrrolidone plus zinc oxide (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.37 to 4.62); the latter two interventions both had confidence intervals consistent with both a clinically important benefit and a clinically important harm, and the former two interventions each had high risk of bias as well as imprecision. Authors' conclusions: A network meta-analysis (NMA) of data from 39 studies (evaluating 21 dressings and topical agents for pressure ulcers) is sparse and the evidence is of low or very low certainty (due mainly to risk of bias and imprecision). Consequently we are unable to determine which dressings or topical agents are the most likely to heal pressure ulcers, and it is generally unclear whether the treatments examined are more effective than saline gauze. More research is needed to determine whether particular dressings or topical agents improve the probability of healing of pressure ulcers. The NMA is uninformative regarding which interventions might best be included in a large trial, and it may be that research is directed towards prevention, leaving clinicians to decide which treatment to use on the basis of wound symptoms, clinical experience, patient preference and cost.","Pressure ulcers, or bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries are restricted areas of injury to the skin or underlying body tissue, or both. Dressings (ointment or gauze to cover wounds) are widely used to treat pressure ulcers and promote healing. THere are many varied dressings to choose from. Skin-level agents also have been used as alternatives to dressings for healing. A clear and current overview of all the evidence is required to help make decisions regarding using dressings or skin-level agents to treat pressure ulcers. This review would ideally help those with pressure ulcers and health professionals choose treatments. This review is a study which assesses the probability of complete ulcer healing associated with alternative dressings and skin-level treatments. We included 51 studies (2947 participants) in this review and analyzed the treatments solely to measure the probability of complete healing. The study included 21 different treatments (13 dressings, 6 skin-level treatments, and 2 additional linking treatments). It included data from 39 studies in 2127 participants, of whom 783 had completely healed wounds. We judged the study network to be scattered. Overall, there were few participants, with few events, both for number of treatments and mixed treatment analysis. Most studies were small or very small. The effect of this sparseness is low reliability in the evidence. This, along with the (mainly) high risk of bias (or prejudice) in the studies, means we judged the majority of evidence to be low or very low quality. We have no confidence in the results regarding the rank order of treatments in this review (very low-quality evidence), but we report a summary of results for some comparisons of treatments compared with standard gauze. We present here only results from evidence we did not consdier to be very low quality, but the reported results should be interpreted while knowing of the very low quality regarding the whole study network. It is not clear if treatments with special protein-breakdown dressings increase the probability of pressure ulcer healing compared with standard gauze. 102 more people were healed with special protein-breakdown dressings per 1000 people than those with standard gauze alone. It is unclear if any of the other treatments examined increase the probability of healing compared with standard gauze (low-quality evidence). Some showed metrics consistent with a clinically important benefit and harm. Others had a high risk of bias and unreliability. A large analysis of data from 39 studies (examining 21 dressings and skin-level agents for pressure ulcers) is scattered. The evidence is also of low or very low quality (due to risk of bias and unreliability). Therefore, we are unable to determine which dressings or skin-level agents are best to heal pressure ulcers. It is unclear whether the treatments are more effective than standard gauze. More research is needed to tell if certain dressings or skin-level agents improve the chance of healing for pressure ulcers. This analysis is uninformative regarding which treatments may best be included in a large trial. It may that research is focused on prevention, leaving clinicians to decide which treatment to use based on wound symptoms, clinical experience, patient preference and cost.","Bedsores are areas of injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both, found in a certain part of the body. Doctors often use dressings to treat bedsores and promote healing, and there are many options to choose from. Doctors have also used medications applied to the skin instead of dressings to promote healing. A clear and current summary of the scientific data is needed to help make decisions about the use of dressings or medicines applied to the skin to treat bedsores. This review would ideally help people with bedsores and doctors decide the best treatment options. This review compares multiple studies to measure the likelihood of complete ulcer (bedsore) healing based on different dressings and medicines applied to the skin. We included 51 studies (2947 people) in this review and compared treatments based on the likelihood of complete healing. We compared 21 different treatments (13 dressings, 6 medicines applied to the skin and 2 mixed treatments) and looked at 39 studies in 2127 people, 783 of whom had completely healed wounds. We thought the data were limited, with relatively few participants, with few wounds, both for the number of treatments and the number of mixed treatments, and mostly small or very small studies. We thought that most of the data were low or very low quality due to unclear data combined with high likelihood of misleading results. We are not sure our ranking of interventions (treatments) is correct, but we summarize our results to compare treatments to saline gauze often used to as a wound dressing. We report only results from data we did not think was low quality, but these reported results should be considered keeping in mind the overall low certainty of data used. We are not sure whether protease-modulating (protein-altering) dressings increased the likelihood of bedsore healing compared to saline gauze. For every 1000 people, 102 more people healed with protease modulating dressings than people treated with only saline gauze. We are not sure collagenase (enzyme) ointment, foam dressings, basic wound contact dressings, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (water-soluble biological molecule) plus zinc oxide increased the likelihood of bedsore healing compared to saline gauze. We conclude that comparing data from 39 studies (rating 21 dressings and medicines applied to the skin for bedsores) is limited and the data are not reliable (due to unclear data and high likelihood of misleading results). Therefore, we cannot tell which dressings or medicines applied to the skin are the most likely to heal bedsores nor whether the treatments we looked at work better than saline gauze. More research is needed to find out whether certain dressings or medicines applied to the skin improve the likelihood of bedsore healing. Our study does not help decide which treatments might best be part of a large trial, and studies may need to focus on prevention, leaving doctors to decide which treatment to use based on wound symptoms, professional experience, what the patients want and cost."
6,29490937,"Hypothyroidism is one of the most common hormone deficiencies in adults. Most of the cases, particularly those of overt hypothyroidism, are easily diagnosed and managed, with excellent outcomes if treated adequately. However, minor alterations of thyroid function determine nonspecific manifestations. Primary hypothyroidism due to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is largely the most common cause of thyroid hormone deficiency. Central hypothyroidism is a rare and heterogeneous disorder characterized by decreased thyroid hormone secretion by an otherwise normal thyroid gland, due to lack of TSH. The standard treatment of primary and central hypothyroidism is hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine sodium (LT4). Treatment guidelines of hypothyroidism recommend monotherapy with LT4 due to its efficacy, long-term experience, favorable side effect profile, ease of administration, good intestinal absorption, long serum half-life and low cost. Despite being easily treatable with a daily dose of LT4, many patients remain hypothyroid due to malabsorption syndromes, autoimmune gastritis, pancreatic and liver disorders, drug interactions, polymorphisms in DIO2 (iodothyronine deiodinase 2), high fiber diet, and more frequently, non-compliance to LT4 therapy. Compliance to levothyroxine treatment in hypothyroidism is compromised by daily and fasting schedule. Many adult patients remain hypothyroid due to all the above mentioned and many attempts to improve levothyroxine therapy compliance and absorption have been made.","Underactive thyroid is one of the most common conditions caused by a lack of specific hormones in adults. Underactive thyroid is usually easily identified and successfully treated. However, small changes in thyroid function determine symptoms that can be caused by many conditions. Primary underactive thyroid caused by a long-term inflamed thyroid, which in turn is caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, is the most common cause of too little thyroid hormones in adults. Central underactive thyroid, which is not very common and has many causes, is when an otherwise normal thyroid makes too little thyroid hormone due to lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine (LT4) is the normal treatment of primary and central underactive thyroid. Treatment guidelines for an underactive thyroid recommend a single drug, levothyroxine (LT4), because of how well it works, how long it has been used, few side effects, how easy it is to use, how well it is absorbed in the stomach, how long it lasts in the blood, and low cost. Although taking LT4 daily treats underactive thyroid, many people still have underactive thyroids due to conditions that do not allow absorption in the stomach, inflammation of the stomach lining caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, pancreatic and live disease, two or more drugs interacting with each other, gene variations, eating too much fiber, and more commonly, not following the prescribed LT4 treatment. Taking levothyroxine as prescribed for underactive thyroid depends on when and if it is taken on an empty stomach. For all of these reasons, many adults still have underactive thyroids. Doctors have tried many ways to make people take levothyroxine as prescribed and make levothyroxine more easily absorbed in the stomach.",
40,32710511,"The presence of chronic heart failure (CHF) results in a significant risk of leg oedema. Medical compression (MC) treatment is one of the basic methods of leg oedema elimination in patients with chronic venous disease and lymphedema, but it is not routinely considered in subjects with CHF-related swelling. In the study, an overview of the current knowledge related to the benefits and risk of using MC in the supportive treatment of leg oedema in CHF patients is presented. The available studies dedicated the comprehensive management of leg swelling using MC in CHF patients published in the English language literature till December 2019 were evaluated in term of the treatment efficacy and safety. In studies performed on CHF populations, manual lymphatic drainage, MC stocking, multilayer bandaged, as well as intermittent pneumatic compression or electric calf stimulations were used. The current evidence is based on non-randomized studies, small study cohorts, as well as very heterogenous populations. The use of the intermittent pneumatic compression in CHF patients significantly increases the right auricular pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressures as well as decreases systemic vascular resistance in most patients without the clinical worsening. The transient and rapid increase in the human atrial natriuretic peptide, after an application of the MC stocking in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II patients was observed without clinical exacerbation. An application of the multilayer bandages in NYHA classes III and IV patients lead a significant increase in the right arterial pressure and lead to transient deterioration of the right and the left ventricular functions. In the manual lymphatic drainage study, aside from expected leg circumference reduction, no clinical worsening was observed. In a pilot study performed in a small cohort of CHF patients, electrical calf stimulation use resulted in a reduction in the lean mass of the legs without cardiac function worsening. The use of local leg compression can be considered stable CHF patients without decompensated heart function for both CHF-related oedema treatment and for treatment of the concomitant diseases leading to leg swelling occurrence. The use of MC in more severe classes of CHF (NYHA III and IV) should be the subject of future clinical studies to select the safest and most efficient compression method as well as to select the patients who benefit most from this kind of treatment.","Long-lasting or chronic heart failure (CHF) results in a significant risk of leg oedema. Leg oedema is swelling due to excess fluid accumulation in the body. Medical compression (MC) treatment is a basic method to eliminate leg oedema in patients with chronic venous disease (abnormal veins) and lymphedema (swelling). However, it is not routinely considered in subjects with CHF-related swelling. This study is an overview of evidence related to the benefits and risk of using MC in the treatment of leg oedema in CHF patients. This paper reviews research published in English up until December 2019. The reviewed paper focused on the management of leg swelling through the use of MC within CHF patients. All reviewed papers were evaluated for treatment efficacy and safety. In studies of CHF populations, several treatment options were used. These options include manual lymphatic drainage, MC stocking, multilayer bandaged, and electric calf stimulations. The current evidence is based on non-randomized studies, small study cohorts, as well as very diverse populations. Intermittent pneumatic compression is a treatment that uses a device that squeezes fluids from an infected area. The treatment in CHF patients significantly increased pressure in the lungs and heart. The treatment decreased systemic vascular resistance, or the resistance that must be overcome to push blood through veins, in most patients without the disease worsening. Human atrial natriuretic peptide, a substance in the body that reduces fluid volume, increased in patients without clinical exacerbation or pain. Use of multilayer bandages in patients significantly increased the right arterial (section of the heart) pressure. Use of multilayer bandages also lead to deterioration of heart chamber function. In the manual lymphatic drainage study, aside from reducing leg size, no clinical worsening was observed. In a trial study performed in a small cohort of CHF patients, electrical calf stimulation resulted in reduced lean mass of the legs without cardiac function worsening. The use of local leg compression within CHF patients could be considered. Use of local leg compression did not decompensate heart function in patients with either CHF-related oedema or concomitant (accompanying) diseases leading to leg swelling. The use of MC in more severe classes of CHF should be further studied to select the safest and most efficient compression method. The patients who would benefit most from MC treatment should also be identified.",
8,33449568,"We have found oral perphenazine 8 mg (OP8) useful as follows: (1) as a nonsedating antiemetic; (2) as a preventative measure similar to the antihistamine promethazine against ketamine-induced psychotomimetic effects; and (3) as a safe single-dose drug (only 1.3 extrapyramidal events per 10,000 patients receiving 4–8 mg oral dose, with all events easily treated). Additionally, we evaluated the efficacy of single-dose OP8 to a single 40 mg dose of aprepitant given preoperatively in colorectal surgery patients at our academic center within an enhanced recovery protocol, which was designed to mitigate opioid utilization, reduce Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV), and optimize patient recovery. In this retrospective study, no differences were noted in antiemetic requirement on postoperative days 0 and 1 between patients receiving OP8 versus aprepitant. As enhanced recovery protocols become more widespread and continue to be applied to other surgical specialties, effective PONV prevention is imperative for improving patient outcomes. OP8 deserves to be properly evaluated (by clinical study, and/or in routine clinical practice) as a part of a cost-effective multimodal enhanced recovery strategy.","Perphenazine 8 mg (OP8) can be taken by mouth for the following uses: (1) as a nonsedating drug to prevent nausea and vomiting; (2) like promethazine, an antihistamine (allergy drug) , to prevent psychotic symptoms caused by ketamine (a pain relief drug); and (3) as a safe one-dose drug. We also rated the success of one-dose OP8 compared to one 40 mg dose of aprepitant, used to prevent nausea and vomiting, given to people before rectum, anus, and colon operations in our center with guidelines designed to help people recover more quickly from surgery, reduce opioid use, and reduce nausea and vomiting after surgery. In this study, we saw no differences in nausea and vomiting prevention on the same day of surgery and one day after surgery between patients who got OP8 versus aprepitant. As guidelines to help people recover more quickly from surgery become more widespread and used for other surgeries, successfully preventing nausea and vomiting after surgery is key to improving patient results. OP8 should be studied as part of a cost-effective, multi-process way to help people recover more quickly from surgery.",
16,7310640,"Six healthy male volunteers were given 5, 20, and 50 mg of oral prednisone and 5, 20, and 400 mg doses of intravenous prednisolone. Plasma and urine concentrations of prednisone and prednisolone were determined by HPLC, and the binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was measured by radioisotopic and equilibrium dialysis techniques. The pharmacokinetics of both oral prednisone and intravenous prednisolone were dose-dependent. The mean oral dose plasma clearances of prednisone ranged from 572 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for the 5 mg dose to 2271 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for the 50 mg dose. Changes in prednisone half-life were insignificant, but increases in the half-life of its metabolite were dose-dependent. The systemic plasma clearance of i.v. prednisolone was dose-dependent and increased from 111 to 194 ml/min/1.73 m 2 over the 5 to 40 mg i.v. dosage range. The steady-state volume of distribution also increased, but little change in mean transit time and half-life was found. The binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was markedly concentration-dependent, and a two compartment, nonlinear equation was used to characterize the effective binding of prednisolone to transcortin and albumin. The apparent pharmacokinetic parameters of protein-free and transcortin-free prednisolone were relatively constant with dose. The interconversion of prednisone and prednisolone varied with time and dose, although prednisolone concentrations dominated by 4- to 10-fold over prednisone. In urine, 2-5% of either administered drug was excreted as prednisone and 11-24% as prednisolone. The apparent renal clearances of both steroids were also nonlinear and unrelated to protein binding. These studies indicate that the pharmacokinetics of prednisone and prednisolone are dose-dependent and that protein binding does not fully explain their apparent nonlinear distribution and disposition.","Six healthy male volunteers were given 5, 20, and 50 mg of oral prednisone (steroid medication given by mouth) and 5, 20, and 400 mg doses of intravenous, or IV, prednisolone (steroid medication delivered through the vein). Plasma (the liquid portion of blood) and urine concentrations of prednisone and prednisolone are determined by HPLC or high performance liquid chromatographic (a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze). How prednisolone attaches to proteins in plasma are also measured. The pharmacokinetics (how the body handles a drug) of both oral prednisone and IV prednisolone are dose-dependent (in which the effects of a drug change when the dose of the drug is changed). There are major changes in prednisone half-life (how long it takes for a drug concentration to be reduced to exactly half its initial amount in the blood), but increases in the half-life of its chemical changes by the body are dose-dependent. How the body clears IV prednisolone from plasma is dose-dependent. The steady-state volume (when how much the body is given of prednisolone is equal to how much of the drug the body eliminates) also increased, but little change in the average time and half-life is found. The binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was primarily based on the concentration or amount of the drug. The pharmacokinetic measures of prednisolone not attached to proteins or transcortin-free (free of a protein from the liver) are mostly constant with the dose provided. How prednisone and prednisolone can be exchanged for one another or converted to the other varies with time and dose, although the amount of prednisolone is greater than the amount of prednisone. The observed renal (kidney-related) elimination or removal of both steroid drugs are also nonlinear (increases in drug exposure are not directly related to increases in given doses) and unrelated to protein attachment. These studies suggest that how the body handles prednisone and prednisolone are dose-dependent and that attaching to proteins does not fully explain their apparent nonlinear distribution and how it is absorbed and excreted in the body.",
25,34556486,"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of antiviral antibody therapies and blood products for the treatment of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). Design: Living systematic review and network meta-analysis, with pairwise meta-analysis for outcomes with insufficient data. Data sources: WHO covid-19 database, a comprehensive multilingual source of global covid-19 literature, and six Chinese databases (up to 21 July 2021). Study selection: Trials randomising people with suspected, probable, or confirmed covid-19 to antiviral antibody therapies, blood products, or standard care or placebo. Paired reviewers determined eligibility of trials independently and in duplicate. Methods: After duplicate data abstraction, we performed random effects bayesian meta-analysis, including network meta-analysis for outcomes with sufficient data. We assessed risk of bias using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach. We meta-analysed interventions with ≥100 patients randomised or ≥20 events per treatment arm. Results: As of 21 July 2021, we identified 47 trials evaluating convalescent plasma (21 trials), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (5 trials), umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (5 trials), bamlanivimab (4 trials), casirivimab-imdevimab (4 trials), bamlanivimab-etesevimab (2 trials), control plasma (2 trials), peripheral blood non-haematopoietic enriched stem cells (2 trials), sotrovimab (1 trial), anti-SARS-CoV-2 IVIg (1 trial), therapeutic plasma exchange (1 trial), XAV-19 polyclonal antibody (1 trial), CT-P59 monoclonal antibody (1 trial) and INM005 polyclonal antibody (1 trial) for the treatment of covid-19. Patients with non-severe disease randomised to antiviral monoclonal antibodies had lower risk of hospitalisation than those who received placebo: casirivimab-imdevimab (odds ratio (OR) 0.29 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.47); risk difference (RD) -4.2%; moderate certainty), bamlanivimab (OR 0.24 (0.06 to 0.86); RD -4.1%; low certainty), bamlanivimab-etesevimab (OR 0.31 (0.11 to 0.81); RD -3.8%; low certainty), and sotrovimab (OR 0.17 (0.04 to 0.57); RD -4.8%; low certainty). They did not have an important impact on any other outcome. There was no notable difference between monoclonal antibodies. No other intervention had any meaningful effect on any outcome in patients with non-severe covid-19. No intervention, including antiviral antibodies, had an important impact on any outcome in patients with severe or critical covid-19, except casirivimab-imdevimab, which may reduce mortality in patients who are seronegative. Conclusion: In patients with non-severe covid-19, casirivimab-imdevimab probably reduces hospitalisation; bamlanivimab-etesevimab, bamlanivimab, and sotrovimab may reduce hospitalisation. Convalescent plasma, IVIg, and other antibody and cellular interventions may not confer any meaningful benefit.","Our objective is to measure the effectiveness and safety of antiviral antibody treatments and substances from blood for treating the new coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a viral respiratory disease.

As of 21 July 2021, we identified 47 trials evaluating a variety of substances from blood and antiviral antibody treatments for treating covid-19. Patients with non-severe disease given antiviral antibodies had lower risk of hospitalsation than those given the inactive placebo treatment. They did not have an important impact on any other outcome. There was no notable difference between antibodies. No other treatment had a meaningful effect on any outcome in patients with non-severe covid-19. No treatment, including antiviral antibodies, had an important effect on any outcome in patients with severe covid-19, except the antibodies casirivimab-imdevimab. These antibodies may reduce risk of death in those who do not make the antibodies naturally. In patients with non-severe covid-19, casirivimab-imdevimab likely reduces hospitalisation. Bamlanivimab-etesevimab, bamlanivimab, and sotrovimab may reduce hospitalisation. Substances from blood and other antibody treatments may not give any meaningful aid.","The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance and safety of antiviral antibody therapies that help the body fight off or prevent a virus and blood products used to treat COVID-19. Published data from other studies is summarized on an ongoing basis and compares data from different medicines, including an analysis to fill in the gaps for studies that have limited data. The data sources for this summary are the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 and six Chinese databases that store data up to July 21, 2021. In clinical trials, people with suspected COVID-19 (person has symptoms and/or exposure to covid but is not tested), probable COVID-19 (person who has tested positive with other tests but not confirmatory test), or confirmed COVID-19 are randomly put into different treatment groups or a placebo, where they receive something that looks like a drug but is not active. Two reviewers determine if the different clinical studies will be included in the summary. After data are collected from the clinical studies, the data are analyzed. The confidence that the results in the studies are accurate is graded using an established process. Clinical trials with 100 or more patients or 20 or more events per treatment type are analyzed. As of July 21st 2021, 47 trials that evaluated different blood products and medicines, including monoclonal antibodies, are found. Patients with non-severe disease who receive antiviral monoclonal antibodies (medicines that may block the virus from attaching to human cells) have lower risk of being hospitalized than those who received placebo. Antiviral monoclonal antibodies did not have an important impact on any other outcome. There is no major difference between monoclonal antibodies. No other treatment intervention is found to have any meaningful effect on any outcome in patients with non-severe COVID-19. No intervention, including antiviral antibodies, has an important impact on any outcome in patients with severe or critical COVID-19, except casirivimab-imdevimab, which may reduce death in patients who had a negative blood test. In conclusion, patients with non-severe COVID-19, the drug casirivimab-imdevimab probably reduces hospital stays; bamlanivimab-etesevimab, bamlanivimab, and sotrovimab may reduce hospitalization. Other antibody and cell interventions may not provide any meaningful benefit."
28,34585235,"Some studies reported that genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 can absorb a few host miRNAs that regulate immune-related genes and then deprive their function. In this perspective, we conjecture that the absorption of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to host miRNAs is not a coincidence, which may be an indispensable approach leading to viral survival and development in host. In our study, we collected five datasets of miRNAs that were predicted to interact with the genome of SARS-CoV-2. The targets of these miRNAs in the five groups were consistently enriched immune-related pathways and virus-infectious diseases. Interestingly, the five datasets shared no one miRNA but their targets shared 168 genes. The signaling pathway enrichment of 168 shared targets implied an unbalanced immune response that the most of interleukin signaling pathways and none of the interferon signaling pathways were significantly different. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using the shared targets showed that PPI pairs, including IL6-IL6R, were related to the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis. In addition, we found that SARS-CoV-2 absorption to host miRNA could benefit two popular mutant strains for more infectivity and pathogenicity. Conclusively, our results suggest that genomic RNA absorption to host miRNAs may be a vital approach by which SARS-CoV-2 disturbs the host immune system and infects host cells.","Some scientific reports have stated that RNA, or genetic material, from COVID-19 virus (a virus leading to lung infection) can absorb microRNA (small chains of RNA that cannot be coded into proteins) from the host. MiRNA can regulate immune system-related genes. When the virus absorbs this miRNA, it can deprive the genes of their ability to function. Using this knowledge, the authors hypothesized or theorized that the absorption of COVID-19 genetic material to host miRNA is not a coincidence. Therefore, this may be a pathway in which the virus survives and replicates within a host. In this study, the authors collected five datasets of miRNAs that were predicted to interact with the COVID-19 genetic material. The targets of the selected miRNA were pathways related to immune response and virus-infectious diseases. Interestingly, the five datasets had no repeated miRNA, but their targets shared 168 genes. A test analyzing the 168 shared targets implied an unbalanced immune response where most of the interleukin (a messenger protein) signaling pathways and none of the interferon (another messenger protein) signaling pathways were significantly different. A second test using the shared targets show protein-protein interaction pairs, including IL6 to IL6R. The test showed the pairs are related to the process of COVID-19 infection and development. Additionally, the authors found that COVID-19 absorption to host miRNA could help two popular viral strains to infect more and cause more damage in hosts. These results suggest that the absorption of viral RNA to host miRNAs may be a way that COVID-19 disturbs the host immune system and infects host cells.",
44,29329171,"Background: We endeavored to develop clinically translatable nonhuman primate (NHP) models of severe polytraumatic hemorrhagic shock. Methods: NHPs were randomized into five severe pressure-targeted hemorrhagic shock (PTHS) ± additional injuries scenarios: 30-min PTHS (PTHS-30), 60-min PTHS (PTHS-60), PTHS-60 + soft tissue injury (PTHS-60+ST), PTHS-60+ ST + femur fracture (PTHS-60+ST+FF), and decompensated PTHS+ST+FF (PTHS-D). Physiologic parameters were recorded and blood samples collected at five time points with animal observation through T = 24 h. Results presented as mean ± SEM; statistics: log transformation followed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparisons, Wilcoxon nonparametric test for comparisons, and the Friedmans' one-way ANOVA; significance: P < 0.05. Results: Percent blood loss was 40% ± 2, 59% ± 3, 52% ± 3, 49% ± 2, and 54% ± 2 for PTHS-30, PTHS-60, PTHS-60+ST, PTHS-60+ST+FF, and PTHS-D, respectively. All animals survived to T = 24 h except one in each of the PTHS-60 and PTHS-60+ST+FF groups and seven in the PTHS-D group. Physiologic, coagulation, and inflammatory parameters demonstrated increasing derangements with increasing model severity. Conclusion: NHPs exhibit a high degree of resilience to hemorrhagic shock and polytrauma as evidenced by moderate perturbations in metabolic, coagulation, and immunologic outcomes with up to 60 min of profound hypotension regardless of injury pattern. Extending the duration of PTHS to the point of decompensation in combination with polytraumatic injury, evoked derangements consistent with those observed in severely injured trauma patients which would require ICU care. Thus, we have successfully established a clinically translatable NHP trauma model for use in testing therapeutic interventions to trauma.","This study aimed to develop nonhuman primate (monkey) (NHP) models of severe polytraumatic (many-injury) hemorrhagic (excessive bleeding) shock that are applicable to human health settings. NHPs were placed into five pressure-targeted hemorrhagic shock (PTHS) scenarios.

Physiologic parameters were recorded. Blood samples were collected at five time points with animal observation through 24 hours. Blood loss percentages were 40%, 59%, 52%, 49%, and 54% for PTHS-30, PTHS-60, PTHS-60+ST, PTHS-60+ST+FF, and PTHS-D, respectively. All animals survived till the end of the study except one in the PTHS-60 and PTHS-60+ST+FF groups. Seven did not survive till the end of the study in the PTHS-D group. Physiologic (overall health), coagulation (blood clotting), and inflammatory (infection-fighting) parameters showed increased disturbance with increasing model severity. NHPs show a high degree of resilience to hemorrhagic shock and polytrauma (more than one injury). This was shown by moderate disturbances in metabolic, coagulation, and immunologic outcomes with low blood pressure in all injury groups. Increasing PTHS duration to the point of organ failure with polytraumatic injury, evoked (led to) disturbances consistent with those observed in severely injured trauma patients requiring ICU care. This study has successfully established a clinically translatable NHP trauma model for use in testing therapeutic interventions to trauma.",

She was released with albendazole, anti-parasite medication, and other helpful medication. With proper use of multiple treatments, Hyadtid disease is curable and the patient can live a healthy life with normal kidney function.","Cystic Echinococcosis, also called Hydatid disease, is caused by the infection of a long tapeworm called Echinococcus granulosus, after it has hatched into the larval stage. A person can often have this condition without symptoms for years before the cyst (growth) grows large enough to cause symptoms in affected organs. The most common organs involved are the liver and lungs although the heart, brain, bone, central nervous system (spinal cord and brain), and kidney may also be involved. This case is about a young woman who presented with left back pain and urinary tract infection (UTI - bladder infection) who was later diagnosed as having left kidney hydatid cyst. The cyst was about 7.8×6.6×8cm with multiple compartments at the lower pole cortex (lower part) of the left kidney. A procedure that uses tiny incisions was performed to remove the cyst and some tissue around the cyst. No complications occurred after the procedure, and she was sent home with anti-worm medicine and other medications. With timely management using several therapies, this condition is curable, and the patient can live a healthy life with normal kidney function."
10,32100225,"This compilation presents a comprehensive review of the literature on common chronic pain conditions of the hand. It briefly presents these common conditions with their biological background, diagnosis, and common management options. It then presents and compares the latest literature available for injection techniques to treat these diagnoses and compares the available evidence. Results: Hand pain is a common condition with 9.7% prevalence in men and 21.6% in women and can cause significant morbidity and disability. It also carries a significant cost to the individuals and the healthcare system, totaling in $4 billion dollars in 2003. Injection therapy is an alternative when conservative treatment fails. Osteoarthritis is the most common chronic hand pain syndrome and affects about 16% of the population. Its mechanism is largely mechanic, and as such, there is controversy if steroid injections are of benefit. Hyaluronic acid (HA) appears to provide substantial relief of pain and may increase functionality. More studies of HA are required to make a definite judgment on its efficacy. Similarly, steroid ganglion cyst injection may confer little benefit. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a compressive neuropathy, and only temporarily relieved with injection therapy. US-guidance provides significant improvement and, while severe cases may still require surgery, can provide a valuable bridge therapy to surgery when conservative treatment fails. Similar bridging treatments and increased efficacy under US-guidance are effective for stenosing tenosynovitis (""trigger finger""), though, interestingly, inflammatory background is associated with decreased effect in this case. When the etiology of the pain is inflammatory, such as in RA, corticosteroid (CS) injections provide significant pain relief and increased functionality. They do not, however, change the course of disease (unlike DMARDs). Another such example is De-Quervain tenosynovitis that sees good benefit from CS injections, and an increased efficacy with US-guidance, and similarly are CS injections for gout. For Raynaud's phenomenon, Botox injections have encouraging results, but more studies are needed to determine safety and efficacy, as well as the possible difference in effect between primary and secondary Raynaud's. Conclusions: Chronic hand pain is a prevalent and serious condition and can cause significant morbidity and disability and interferes with independence and activities of daily living. Conservative treatment remains the first line of treatment; however, when first-line treatments fail, steroid injections can usually provide benefit. In some cases, Hyaluronic acid or Botox may also be beneficial. US-guidance is increasing in hand injection and almost ubiquitously provides safer, more effective injections. Hand surgery remains the alternative for refractory pain.","This report presents a thorough review of the literature on common chronic pain conditions of the hand. It briefly presents common conditions with their biological background, diagnosis, and common options to treat and manage pain. The report also shows and compares the latest literature available for injection methods to treat these diagnoses and compares the available evidence. Hand pain is a common condition occuring in 9.7% of men and 21.6% of women and can cause significant illness and disability. It is also costly to the individuals and the healthcare system, totaling in $4 billion dollars in 2003. Injection therapy (a treatment that involves inserting a needle into the skin to deliver medicine and reduce pain) is an option when other non-surgical treatments fail. Osteoarthritis (the wearing down of flexible tissue at the end of bones) is the most common chronic hand pain condition and affects about 16% of the population. There is disagreement on whether steroid injections are helpful to osteoarthritis. Injections of hyaluronic acid (a natural lubricant that can relieve pain) appear to provide significant relief of pain and may increase movement. More studies of hyaluronic acid are required before deciding how well it works. Similarly, steroid injection to reduce a ganglion cyst (a swelling or bump on the wrist joint) may have little benefit. Injection therapy provides only short-term relief for carpal tunnel syndrome (pinched nerves in the wrist). While severe cases of hand pain may still require surgery, injection therapy may be an additional treatment step before surgery. Similar treatments under US-guidance are effective for a condition called trigger finger where the finger gets locked in a bent position. When the cause of the pain is inflammation (the body's response to injury or infection often causing swelling, pain, or redness), corticosteroid or steroid injections provide significant pain relief and increased movement. Corticosteroid injections do not, however, change the course of disease. Other conditions such as gout (a type of arthritis that causes sudden pain or swelling, often in the big toe) and De-Quervain tenosynovitis (pain in the tendons in the thumb) may get some benefit from corticosteroid injections. Botox injections show encouraging results for Raynaud's phenomenon (spasms caused by slow blood flow in the fingers and other extremities), but more studies are needed to determine safety and how well the injections work. Chronic hand pain is a common and serious condition, can cause significant illness and disability, and interferes with independence and the activities of daily living. Careful, non-invasive treatment remains the first line of treatment; however, when first-line treatments fail, steroid injections can usually provide benefit. In some cases, Hyaluronic acid or Botox may also be helpful. US-guidance is expanding in hand injections and provides safer, more effective injections. Hand surgery remains the alternative for pain that is not responding to multiple treatments.",

Several vaccines have been developed to control the COVID-19, but the potential effectiveness of the mucosal vaccine remains to be documented. In this study, we constructed a recombinant L. plantarum LP18: RBD expressing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein via the surface anchoring route. The amount of the RBD protein was maximally expressed under the culture condition with 200 ng/mL of inducer at 33 °C for 6 h. Further, we evaluated the immune response in mice via the intranasal administration of LP18:RBD. The results showed that the LP18:RBD significantly elicited RBD-specific mucosal IgA antibodies in respiratory tract and intestinal tract. The percentages of CD3 + CD4+ T cells in spleens of mice administrated with the LP18:RBD were also significantly increased. This indicated that LP18:RBD could induce a humoral immune response at the mucosa, and it could be used as a mucosal vaccine candidate against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We provided the first experimental evidence that the recombinant L. plantarum LP18: RBD could initiate immune response in vivo, which implies that the mucosal immunization using recombinant LAB system could be a promising vaccination strategy to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic.","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a breathing-related disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has been an ongoing global pandemic. Several vaccines have been developed to control the COVID-19, but the potential effectiveness of the mucosal vaccine (vaccines given at moist, inner lining of some organs and body cavities, such as the nose, mouth, lungs, and stomach) remains to be documented. In this study, researchers constructed a lactic acide gene called L. plantarum LP18: RBD that uses information from the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (the part of the virus located on the spike protein which is involved in introducing a virus into host cells) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by anchoring to the surface. Researchers also evaluate the immune response in mice by the intranasal administration (a non-invasive route for drug delivery through the nose) of LP18:RBD. The results show that LP18:RBD significantly brought out IgA antibodies (antibodies that play a crucial role in the immune function of mucous membranes) in the organs involved in breathing and in digesting food. These results show that LP18:RBD may create humoral immune responses (molecules that create antibodies against a specific antigen and involves substances found in the humors, or body fluids) and could be used as a mucosal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study is the first experiment that shows LP18:RBD could start an immune response within a living person or animal and suggests that mucosal vaccines could be a promising vaccine strategy to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic.",
37,20194915,"Background: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can be associated with neurotoxic side effects including cognitive dysfunction, a problem of considerable importance given the usual long-term course of treatment. Pregabalin is a relatively new AED widely used for the treatment of seizures and some types of chronic pain including fibromyalgia. We measured the cognitive effects of 12 weeks of pregabalin in healthy volunteers. Methods: Thirty-two healthy volunteers were randomized in a double-blind parallel study to receive pregabalin or placebo (1:1). Pregabalin was titrated over 8 weeks to 600 mg/d. At baseline, and after 12 weeks of treatment, all subjects underwent cognitive testing. Test-retest changes in all cognitive and subjective measures were Z scored against test-retest regressions previously developed from 90 healthy volunteers. Z scores from the placebo and pregabalin groups were compared using Wilcoxon tests. Results: Thirty subjects completed the study (94%). Three of 6 target cognitive measures (Digit Symbol, Stroop, Controlled Oral Word Association) revealed significant test-retest differences between the pregabalin and placebo groups, all showing negative effects with pregabalin (p < 0.05). These cognitive effects were paralleled by complaints on the Portland Neurotoxicity Scale, a subjective measure of neurotoxicity (p < 0.01). Conclusion: At conventional doses and titration, pregabalin induced mild negative cognitive effects and neurotoxicity complaints in healthy volunteers. These effects are one factor to be considered in the selection and monitoring of chronic AED therapy.

25,33080005,"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is threatening billions of people worldwide. Tocilizumab has shown promising results in retrospective studies in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with a good safety profile. Objective: To evaluate the effect of early tocilizumab administration vs standard therapy in preventing clinical worsening in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Design, setting, and participants: Prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial that randomized patients hospitalized between March 31 and June 11, 2020, with COVID-19 pneumonia to receive tocilizumab or standard of care in 24 hospitals in Italy. Cases of COVID-19 were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction method with nasopharyngeal swab. Eligibility criteria included COVID-19 pneumonia documented by radiologic imaging, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (Pao2/Fio2) ratio between 200 and 300 mm Hg, and an inflammatory phenotype defined by fever and elevated C-reactive protein. Interventions: Patients in the experimental arm received intravenous tocilizumab within 8 hours from randomization (8 mg/kg up to a maximum of 800 mg), followed by a second dose after 12 hours. Patients in the control arm received supportive care following the protocols of each clinical center until clinical worsening and then could receive tocilizumab as a rescue therapy. Main outcome and measures: The primary composite outcome was defined as entry into the intensive care unit with invasive mechanical ventilation, death from all causes, or clinical aggravation documented by the finding of a Pao2/Fio2 ratio less than 150 mm Hg, whichever came first. Results: A total of 126 patients were randomized (60 to the tocilizumab group; 66 to the control group). The median (interquartile range) age was 60.0 (53.0-72.0) years, and the majority of patients were male (77 of 126, 61.1%). Three patients withdrew from the study, leaving 123 patients available for the intention-to-treat analyses. Seventeen patients of 60 (28.3%) in the tocilizumab arm and 17 of 63 (27.0%) in the standard care group showed clinical worsening within 14 days since randomization (rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.59-1.86). Two patients in the experimental group and 1 in the control group died before 30 days from randomization, and 6 and 5 patients were intubated in the 2 groups, respectively. The trial was prematurely interrupted after an interim analysis for futility. Conclusions and relevance: In this randomized clinical trial of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and Pao2/Fio2 ratio between 200 and 300 mm Hg who received tocilizumab, no benefit on disease progression was observed compared with standard care. Further blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the results and to evaluate possible applications of tocilizumab in different stages of the disease.","The COVID-19 pandemic is threatening billions of people worldwide. COVID-19 is a viral, breathing-related disease. Tocilizumab, a type of drug called monoclonal antibodies, has shown promising results in recent studies in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia or lung infections. Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of giving tocilizumab early, compared to the standard treatment, to prevent a hospitalized COVID-19 patient with pneumonia from getting worse. Patients who are in the hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia are randomly put in groups to receive either tocilizumab or the standard care. Cases of COVID-19 are confirmed by taking a swab from inside the back of the nose. To be included in the study, patients must have COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by an x-ray, certain oxygen levels, a fever, and an increase in C-reactive proteins which are created in the liver in response to inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection). Patients in the experimental group receive tocilizumab through an IV (medicine is delivered in a vein in the arm) within 8 hours of being randomly placed in the group. A second dose is given after 12 hours. Patients in the comparison group receive support care based on hospital standards until the patient's condition worsens, and then they receive tocilizumab. The main study observations of interest are 1) going into intensive care units with machines to help breathe, 2) death from all causes, or 3) a worsening of a condition measured by oxygen levels. A total of 126 patients are randomly put into the experimental group to receive tocilizumab (60 patients) or in the comparison group (66 patients). The average age is 60 years, and most patients (61.1%) are male. Three patients dropped out of the study, leaving 123 patients in the study. Within 14 days since they were randomly put into groups, 17 out of 60 patients in the tocilizumab (experimental) group and 17 out of 63 patients in the standard (comparison) group have worsening conditions. Two patients in the experimental group and 1 in the comparison group died before 30 days after being randomly assigned into groups. Six patients in the experimental group and 5 patients of the other group were intubated (a tube is inserted through the nose or throat to help a person breathe). The trial was stopped early after an analysis showed that the experimental group is not likely to show any added benefit than the comparison group. This clinical study of adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed no benefit on lessening of the disease in patients receiving tocilizumab when compared to the standard care. Additional clinical studies are needed to confirm these results and to evaluate tocilizumab when given at different stages of the disease.",
28,34578462,"Evidence is emerging that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect various organs of the body, including cardiomyocytes and cardiac endothelial cells in the heart. This review focuses on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the heart after direct infection that can lead to myocarditis and an outline of potential treatment options. The main points are: (1) Viral entry: SARS-CoV-2 uses specific receptors and proteases for docking and priming in cardiac cells. Thus, different receptors or protease inhibitors might be effective in SARS-CoV-2-infected cardiac cells. (2) Viral replication: SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for replication. Drugs acting against ssRNA(+) viral replication for cardiac cells can be effective. (3) Autophagy and double-membrane vesicles: SARS-CoV-2 manipulates autophagy to inhibit viral clearance and promote SARS-CoV-2 replication by creating double-membrane vesicles as replication sites. (4) Immune response: Host immune response is manipulated to evade host cell attacks against SARS-CoV-2 and increased inflammation by dysregulating immune cells. Efficiency of immunosuppressive therapy must be elucidated. (5) Programmed cell death: SARS-CoV-2 inhibits programmed cell death in early stages and induces apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in later stages. (6) Energy metabolism: SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to disturbed energy metabolism that in turn leads to a decrease in ATP production and ROS production. (7) Viroporins: SARS-CoV-2 creates viroporins that lead to an imbalance of ion homeostasis. This causes apoptosis, altered action potential, and arrhythmia.","There is evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a severe breathing-related virus, can infect various body organs, like heart cells. This review focuses on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the heart after direct infection that can cause myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) and possible treatments. The main points are: (1) Viral entry: SARS-CoV-2 uses specific cell parts to attach to heart cells. Thus, different blockers of specific cell parts may help with SARS-CoV-2-infected heart cells. (2) Viral replication: SARS-CoV-2 uses a specific molecule for replication. Drugs acting against a specific form of viral replication for heart cells can be effective. (3) Cell degradation and transport molecules: SARS-COV-2 alters cell degradation to block virus removal and promote virus replication by making transport molecules as replication sites. (4) Immune response: Patient immune response is altered to evade paitent cell attacks against SARS-CoV-2 and increased inflammation by impairing immune cells. Efficiency of immune-system-suppressing therapy must be explained. (5) Intentional cell death: SARS-CoV-2 blocks intentional cell death in early stages and causes cell death in later stages. (6) Energy metabolism: SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to damaged energy metabolism that leads to a decrease in energy and reactive chemical production. (7) Virus channels: SARS-CoV-2 pokes openings in the cell that leads to leaking of important cell molecules. This leaking causes cell death, altered cell signals, and an irregular heart beat.","New scientific research has shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease), can infect various parts of the body, including cells within the heart. This paper reviews the effects COVID-19 has on the heart after direct infection, which can lead to myocarditis. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle. This paper will also outline potential treatment options for this illness. The authors proposed seven potential treatment options to help reduce heart injury in COVID-19 patients. First, the virus uses specific entry points to infect heart cells so that it can replicate and grow stronger. Therefore, specific drugs that target these entry points might be helpful. Second, COVID-19 uses a specific pathway to replicate itself. This pathway uses RNA, a chain of genetic material that helps form proteins. Drugs that prevent the creation of RNA for viral replication could be helpful. Third, COVID-19 decreases the body's ability to degrade infected cells. This prevents the body from decreasing the amount of virus within it. COVID-19 is able to replicate as it creates double-membrane vesicles, extra-strong chambers, as spaces safe from the body's natural defense system. Fourth, COVID-19 can cause the host immune response to be changed so that the virus is not targeted for removal. It can also increase inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) which alters the function of immune cells. Better understanding of drugs that suppress the immune system is needed. Fifth, COVID-19 prevents cells from dying in the early stages of infection but induces cell death later, once it has replicated and moved to other cells. Sixth, COVID-19 infection can disturb energy metabolism (the process in getting energy from food). This can reduce energy production and affect cell function and viability. Seventh, COVID-19 creates virus proteins to lead to an imbalance within the host body. This can cause cell death, abnormal heart function, and an abnormal heartbeat."
17,460879,"The tongue is the most common cause of upper airway obstruction, a situation seen most often in patients who are comatose or who have suffered cardiopulmonary arrest. Other common causes of upper airway obstruction include edema of the oropharynx and larynx, trauma, foreign body, and infection. The management of the patient with upper airway obstruction depends upon the cause of the obstruction, the training and skills of the rescuer, and the availability of adjuncts necessary to perform advanced airway techniques. In most cases, merely positioning the patient or performing one of the three maneuvers designed to elevate the tongue will open the airway of the comatose patient or the victim of cardiac arrest. In patients with suspected foreign body obstruction, abdominal or chest compression should be performed immediately, with digital extraction of the foreign body reserved for those in whom these maneuvers are unsuccessful. Most patients with obstruction secondary to edema, trauma, or infection can be managed initially with orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation. Intubation should be attempted prior to surgical management of the airway in most cases of upper airway obstruction. Occasionally, however, cricothyroidotomy or tracheostomy is necessary to establish an airway. The choice of technique depends primarily on the experience and skills of the rescuing physician or paramedic. In most cases, cricothyroidotomy is technically more simple and more easily performed than tracheotomy, especially for the physician who has not been trained in surgery or otolaryngology and for the nonphysician rescuer. No matter what the method employed in establishing an airway in a patient with upper airway obstruction, it must be performed quickly and a source of ventilation provided for the patient once the airway has been secured.","The tongue is the most common cause of blocked upper airways, seen most often in people in comas or cardiac arrest (abrupt heart stop). Other common causes of blocked upper airways include swelling of the middle part of the throat and voice box, injury, objects that shouldn’t be swallowed, and infection. Treatment of the patient with blocked upper airways depends on the cause of the blockage, the training and skills of the rescuer, and the availability of additional treatments needed for advanced airway methods. In most cases, simply positioning the patient or doing one of the three maneuvers to raise the tongue will open the airway of the patient in a coma or cardiac arrest. In people thought to have swallowed an object that should not be swallowed, stomach or chest compression should be done immediately, with removing the object with the fingers used only when these maneuvers do not work. Most people with blocked airways that occur due to swelling, injury, or infection can be treated first without breathing tubes through the mouth or nose. Breathing tubes should be used before surgery in most instances of blocked upper airways. Sometimes, however, surgery to cut a hole in the neck is needed to open the airway. The experience and skills of the rescuing doctor or paramedic mostly determines the approach. Usually, a surgery to cut a hole in the neck is simpler and easier to do than opening the windpipe, especially for a doctor who does not have surgery training or the rescuer who is not a doctor. Regardless of the method used to open the airway in a patient with blocked upper airways, it must be done quickly, and air must be supplied to the person once the airway is open.","The tongue is the most common cause of airway blockage, especially in comatose patients or those suffering cardiac arrest. Other common causes of airway blockage include swelling from trapped fluid of the airway, trauma, something stuck in the airway, and infection.

Mostly, just arranging the patient or using one of three methods to elevate the tongue will open the airway of the comatose patient or person with cardiac arrest. In patients with something stuck in the airway, abdominal or chest squeezing should be done quickly, with removal by fingers when squeezing is unsuccessful. Most with blockage due to swelling from trapped fluid, trauma, or infection can be treated initially with breathing tubes. Breathing tubes should be used before surgery of the airway in most cases of airway blockage. Sometimes, however, airway surgery is needed to create an airway.

26,34368314,"Background: As a highly contagious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is wreaking havoc around the world due to continuous spread among close contacts mainly via droplets, aerosols, contaminated hands or surfaces. Therefore, centralized isolation of close contacts and suspected patients is an important measure to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. At present, the quarantine duration in most countries is 14 d due to the fact that the incubation period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is usually identified as 1-14 d with median estimate of 4-7.5 d. Since COVID-19 patients in the incubation period are also contagious, cases with an incubation period of more than 14 d need to be evaluated. Case summary: A 70-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine of The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University on April 5 due to a cough with sputum and shortness of breath. On April 10, the patient was transferred to the Fever Clinic for further treatment due to close contact to one confirmed COVID-19 patient in the same room. During the period from April 10 to May 6, nucleic acid and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were tested 7 and 4 times, respectively, all of which were negative. On May 7, the patient developed fever with a maximum temperature of 39℃, and his respiratory difficulties had deteriorated. The results of nucleic acid and antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 were positive. On May 8, the nucleic acid and antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Heilongjiang Provincial Center for Disease Control were also positive, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period. Further epidemiological investigations and clinical observations are urgently needed to identify the optimal incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 and formulate rational and evidence-based quarantine policies for COVID-19 accordingly.","Coronavirus disease 2019, also known as COVID-19, is a highly contagious, viral, breathing-related disease that has caused world-wide distress. Continual spread of COVID-19 occurs between people in close contact with one another through coughing, sneezing, breathing, talking, and touching dirty hands or surfaces. To prevent further spread of COVID-19, a period of quarantine (isolation) is recommended for those suspected of having COVID-19 and/or those who believe they have come in contact with a COVID-19-infected person. In most countries, the recommended quarantine duration is 14 days. This is because the incubation period, or the time between exposure and the first signs of illness, of respiratory or breathing-related illnesses is normally between 4 to 7.5 days. However, potential COVID-19 patients are still contagious during the incubation period. Cases with incubation periods longer than 14 days need further evaluation by doctors. For example, a 70-year-old man was admitted to the hospital on April 5th, reporting a cough, the spitting up of saliva and mucus, and shortness of breath. On April 10th, the man was transferred to the Fever Clinic within the hospital for additional treatment as he had experienced close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. From April 10th to May 6th, the man was tested for COVID-19 several times. All tests returned negative, detecting no COVID-19. On May 7th, the man developed a severe fever, and his breathing issues become worse. The man was tested again for COVID-19 and was positive, detecting COVID-19. On May 8th, a second COVID-19 test was conducted by the Heilongjiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and was returned positive. The man was diagnosed with COVID-19, and his health status was recorded by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This example shows the importance of the COVID-19 incubation period. Additional research is needed to better define the incubation period of COVID-19 to create quarantine measures that best protect human health.",
48,34681945,"Therapeutic success in treating patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is limited by the multivariate disease etiology, multi-organ presentation, systemic involvement, and complex immunopathogenesis. Agents targeting B-cell differentiation and survival are not efficacious for all patients, indicating a need to target other inflammatory mediators. One such target is the type I interferon pathway. Type I interferons upregulate interferon gene signatures and mediate critical antiviral responses. Dysregulated type I interferon signaling is detectable in many patients with SLE and other autoimmune diseases, and the extent of this dysregulation is associated with disease severity, making type I interferons therapeutically tangible targets. The recent approval of the type I interferon-blocking antibody, anifrolumab, by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with SLE demonstrates the value of targeting this pathway. Nevertheless, the interferon pathway has pleiotropic biology, with multiple cellular targets and signaling components that are incompletely understood. Deconvoluting the complexity of the type I interferon pathway and its intersection with lupus disease pathology will be valuable for further development of targeted SLE therapeutics. This review summarizes the immune mediators of the interferon pathway, its association with disease pathogenesis, and therapeutic modalities targeting the dysregulated interferon pathway.","Successfully treating patients with systematic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells) is limited by the different causes, its presence in multiple organs and systems, and a complex immune response. Treatments that target certain inflammatory (infection-fighting) processes in the body may be needed for some patients. One such target is the type I interferon pathway, a specific immune system pathway. Type I interferons increase the production of interferon genes (genes that allow communication between cells to activate the immune system) and brings about critical immune responses to fight viruses. Problems with the signaling in type I interferons are found in patients with lupus, and the extent of the problem is connected to how serious the disease is, making type I interferons possible targets for treatment. The recent approval of the type I interferon-blocking antibody medicine, anifrolumab, by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating patients with lupus shows the value of targeting this pathway. Nevertheless, the interferon pathway has multiple cells and signaling parts that are not completely understood. Understanding the type I interferon pathway and how it relates to lupus will be valuable for future development of lupus treatments. This review summarizes the immune process of the interferon pathway, its association with disease development, and therapeutic methods that target problems interferon pathway.","Treatment success for patients with full-body or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an inflammatory disease in which immune cells mistakely attack joints, skin, brain cells and more, is limited by muti-factor disease causes, multi-organ damage, full-body effect, and complex causes for immune cell dysfunction. Treatment targeting creation and survival of antibody-creating immune cells are not effective for all patients, indicating a need to target other inflammatory groups. One target group is the type I interferon pathway, a cellular signaling pathway that affects the entire immune system. Type I interferons increase the amount of certain signaling proteins and influence important antiviral responses. Impaired type I interferon signaling is detectable in many with SLE and similar diseases. The extent of this impairment is linked with disease severity, making type I interferons a possible treatment target.

48,34528084,"Objectives: To characterize the relationship of anifrolumab pharmacokinetics with efficacy and safety in patients with moderate to severe SLE despite standard therapy, using pooled data from 2 phase 3 trials. Methods: TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 were randomized, placebo-controlled, 52-week trials of intravenous anifrolumab (every 4 weeks for 48 weeks). For the exposure-response analysis, BILAG-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) or SLE Responder Index (SRI[4]) response rates at week 52 in each quartile/tertile of average anifrolumab serum concentration (Cave) were compared for anifrolumab and placebo in all-comers, patients who completed treatment, and interferon gene signature (IFNGS)-high patients who completed treatment, using average marginal effect logistic regression. Relationships between exposure and key safety events were assessed graphically. Results: Of patients in TULIP-1/TULIP-2 who received anifrolumab (150 mg [n = 91], 300 mg [n = 356]) or placebo (n = 366), 574 completed treatment, of whom 470 were IFNGS high. In the exposure-efficacy analyses, BICLA and SRI(4) treatment differences favoring anifrolumab 300 mg vs placebo were observed across Cave subgroups and all analysis populations. Logistic regression identified Cave as a significant covariate for predicted BICLA response, as higher anifrolumab Cave predicted greater efficacy. There was no evidence of exposure-driven incidence of key safety events through week 52 in patients receiving anifrolumab 150 or 300 mg. Conclusion: While higher Cave predicted greater efficacy, consistent positive benefit favouring anifrolumab 300 mg vs placebo was observed in BICLA and SRI(4) responses across Cave subgroups in the TULIP trials. There was no evidence of exposure-driven safety events.","The objective of this study is to describe the relationship of how the drug called anifrolumab works with the effectiveness and safety in patients who have moderate to severe lupus (when your immune system attacks healthy cells) despite receiving standard therapy.

29,34579048,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with diverse clinical manifestations, immune dysfunction, and gut microbiota alterations. The nutritional and biochemical quality of one's diet can influence the intestinal microbiota, which may play a role in the defense mechanisms against potential pathogens, by promoting a wide variety of immune-host interactions. In the COVID-19 pandemic, besides the development of pharmacological therapies, a healthy balanced diet, rich with food-derived antioxidants, may be a useful strategy. Many studies demonstrated that vitamins and probiotic therapies have positive effects on the treatment and prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation in COVID-19. The ecology of the gut microbiota in the digestive tract has been linked to the transport function of the host receptor known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), suggesting that COVID-19 may be related to the gut microbiota. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and its receptor (ACE2), play central roles in modulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In addition, ACE2 has functions that act independently of the RAS. ACE2 is the receptor for the SARS coronavirus, and ACE2 is essential for the expression of neutral amino acid transporters in the gut. In this context, ACE2 modulates innate immunity and influences the composition of the gut microbiota. Malnutrition is one of the leading underlying causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide and, including comorbidities, may be a major cause of worse outcomes and higher mortality among COVID-19 patients. This paper reviews the research on dietary components, with particular emphasis on vitamins, antioxidants, and probiotic therapies, and their impacts on the intestinal microbiota's diversity during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Coronavirus infection (a viral, respiratory disease) is associated with different types of symptoms, as well as damage to the immune system and changes in gut microbiota, which are important microorganisms in the digestive system that process food and help the body use nutrients. The nutrition and chemical processes of one's diet can alter the microbiota in the stomach, which may play a role in the body's ability to fight possible infections. In the Covid-19 pandemic, besides developing medicines and vaccines, a healthy diet with antioxidants (vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells) may be a useful option. Many studies show that vitamins and probiotic (good bacteria) therapies have positive effects on the treatment and prevention of oxidative stress (a condition that happens when antioxidant levels are low leading to cell and tissue damage) and inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) in Covid-19. Research on the relationship between the gut microbiota in the digestive system and its environment is linked to the protein receptor of the cell surface that allows the virus to enter, called ACE2, suggesting that Covid-19 may be linked to the gut microbiota. The protein and its ACE2 receptor that allows viruses to attach to cells play central roles in controlling the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is the system that regulates blood pressure and fluids in the body. In addition, ACE2 has functions that act without influence by the RAS. ACE2 is the receptor for the SARS coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and ACE2 is essential for the production of amino acids (molecules that form proteins) in the gut. In this instance, ACE2 controls natural immunity or infection prevention and influences what substances make up the gut microbiota. Malnutrition is one of the leading underlying causes of illness and death across the world and, including other health problems, may be a major cause of worse outcomes and higher deaths among Covid-19 patients. This paper reviews the existing research on food and diets, with a focus on vitamins, antioxidants, and probiotics, and their impact on the gut bacteria during the coronavirus pandemic.",
20,10917403,"Fluoxetine (FLX) has a unique pharmacokinetic profile. Its major metabolite, norfluoxetine (NFLX), possesses FLX's antidepressant efficacy and a half-life of 7 to 15 days, suggesting the possibility of nonstandard dosing strategies. This study examined the tolerability of a weekly dose and its equivalence to daily dosing of FLX for the continuation phase of treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). One hundred fourteen subjects initially received open-label treatment with 20 mg of FLX daily for 7 weeks. Subsequently, 70 subjects with a score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) of 12 or less were randomly assigned in a double-blind design to one of three treatment groups: 20 mg FLX daily (N = 21), 60 mg FLX weekly (N = 28), or placebo (N = 21) and were followed for 7 weeks. HAM-D scores and blood levels of FLX and NFLX were analyzed using a repeated-measures analysis of variance. During the double-blind phase, blood levels for both FLX and NFLX differed across the treatment groups, yet no statistically significant difference in HAM-D scores was observed. There was no difference in the dropout rate across the groups. Subjects could not correctly identify the treatment group into which they were assigned. Weekly dosing of FLX seems to be well tolerated and possibly as effective as daily dosing in maintaining the therapeutic response in subjects with MDD.","Fluoxetine is a type of antidepressant that is also called prozac. There is the possibility that fluoxetine can be given to patients in dose amounts that is different from the regular doses of other medications. In order to study the treatment for major depressive disorder, this study examined how well patients handled a weekly dose of fluoxetine and then monitored the same amount but given daily during a following phase of the study. In this study, 114 patients first receive treatment with 20 mg of fluoxetine daily for 7 weeks. Next, 70 patients are randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: 20 mg fluoxetine daily with 21 subjects, 60 mg fluoxetine weekly with 28 patients, or placebo of an inactive substance that looks like the drug with 21patients and are followed for 7 weeks. Scores for depression using a rating scale and blood levels of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine, another form of fluoxetine, are analyzed. Blood levels for both fluoxetine and norfluoxetine differ across the three treatment groups, but there are no major differences in the scores for depression observed. There is no difference in the rate of patients who dropped out of the study across the groups. Patients cannot correctly identify the treatment group into which they were assigned. Weekly dosing of fluoxetine seems to be handled well by patients and is possibly as effective as daily dosing for treating patients with major depressive disorder.",
32,33172445,"Background: Genome-wide and clinical studies have linked the 677C→T polymorphism in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with hypertension, whilst limited evidence shows that intervention with riboflavin (i.e. the MTHFR co-factor) can lower blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype. We investigated the impact of this common polymorphism on BP throughout adulthood and hypothesised that riboflavin status would modulate the genetic risk of hypertension. Methods: Observational data on 6076 adults of 18-102 years were drawn from the Joint Irish Nutrigenomics Organisation project, comprising the Trinity-Ulster Department of Agriculture (TUDA; volunteer sample) and the National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS; population-based sample) cohorts. Participants were recruited from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (UK) in 2008-2012 using standardised methods. Results: The variant MTHFR 677TT genotype was identified in 12% of adults. From 18 to 70 years, this genotype was associated with an increased risk of hypertension (i.e. systolic BP ≥ 140 and/or a diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg): odds ratio (OR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.90; P = 0.016, after adjustment for antihypertensive drug use and other significant factors, namely, age, male sex, BMI, alcohol and total cholesterol. Low or deficient biomarker status of riboflavin (observed in 30.2% and 30.0% of participants, respectively) exacerbated the genetic risk of hypertension, with a 3-fold increased risk for the TT genotype in combination with deficient riboflavin status (OR 3.00, 95% CI, 1.34-6.68; P = 0.007) relative to the CC genotype combined with normal riboflavin status. Up to 65 years, we observed poorer BP control rates on antihypertensive treatment in participants with the TT genotype (30%) compared to those without this variant, CT (37%) and CC (45%) genotypes (P < 0.027). Conclusions: The MTHFR 677TT genotype is associated with higher BP independently of homocysteine and predisposes adults to an increased risk of hypertension and poorer BP control with antihypertensive treatment, whilst better riboflavin status is associated with a reduced genetic risk. Riboflavin intervention may thus offer a personalised approach to prevent the onset of hypertension in adults with the TT genotype; however, this requires confirmation in a randomised trial in non-hypertensive adults.","Research has linked a specific a genetic variation or gene change, known as 677C→T, within the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR - a blood-pressure-related protein) with hypertension (high blood pressure). Limited evidence has shown that taking riboflavin, which is a co-factor or helper of MTHFR, can lower blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype. This study investigated the impact of the common genetic variation on BP throughout adulthood. They hypothesized that riboflavin status would alter the genetic risk of hypertension. Observational data on 6076 adults of 18-102 years were drawn from the Joint Irish Nutrigenomics Organization project, comprising the Trinity-Ulster Department of Agriculture (TUDA; volunteer sample) and the National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS; population-based sample) cohorts or groups. Participants were recruited from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (UK) in 2008-2012 using standard methods. The genetic variant MTHFR 677TT genotype was identified in 12% of recruited adults. In patients 18 to 70 years old, this genotype was associated with an increased risk of hypertension. Low or deficient levels of riboflavin increased the genetic risk of hypertension. Participants with 677TT genotype and a riboflavin deficiency have a 3-fold higher risk of developing hypertension. In participants up to 65 years, the authors observed poorer BP control rates on antihypertensive treatment in participants with the TT genotype compared to participants with other genotypes (CC or CT). The study concluded the MTHFR 677TT genotype is associated with higher BP independently of homocysteine levels. Homocysteine is a chemical your body produces to help make proteins. Additionally, the MTHFR 677TT genotype makes people more likely to have an increased risk of hypertension and poorer BP control with antihypertensive treatment. Better riboflavin status was associated with a reduced genetic risk for hypertension. Riboflavin administration or use may offer a personalized or unique approach to prevent the onset or start of hypertension in adults with the TT genotype. However, this requires more researched in non-hypertensive adults.","Genetic and clinical studies have linked variation in a specific DNA sequence for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a certain protein, with high blood pressure. Some evidence shows that treatment with riboflavin (a molecule that attaches to MTHFR) can lower blood pressure (BP) in patients with high blood pressure and an altered DNA sequence for MTHFR called 677TT. We tested the impact of this altered DNA sequence on BP through adulthood. We believed that riboflavin would affect the genetic risk of high blood pressure. Patients were recruited from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in 2008-2012. The altered DNA sequence of MTHFR 677TT was found in 12% of adults. From 18 to 70 years, this altered DNA sequence, or genotype, was linked with increased risk of high blood pressure after adjusting for blood pressure medication use, age, sex, body mass, alcohol, total cholesterol, and other factors. Low or no riboflavin (seen in 30.2% and 30.0% of participants, respectively) worsened the genetic risk of high blood pressure. Patients with a certain genotype along with no riboflavin had a 3-fold increased risk compared to patients with the standard genotype along with normal riboflavin. Up to 65 years, we saw poorer BP control rates on anti-high-BP treatment in participants with a certain DNA sequence for MTHFR compared to those without this altered DNA sequence. A specific gentoype for MTHFR is linked with higher BP regardless of homocysteine, a molecule that MTHFR acts on, and biases adults to increased risk of high BP and poorer BP control with anti-high-BP treatment. Better riboflavin amount is linked with reduced genetic risk. Riboflavin treatment may thus give an individualized approach to prevent high BP in adults with a certain genotype for MTHFR. Still, this needs confirmation in a trial in adults without high BP."
38,34125728,"Mask wearing is now ubiquitous because of the COVID-19 pandemic and has given rise to medical device-related pressure injuries in persons at risk of skin breakdown. The ear has unique anatomy that is particularly susceptible to injury from pressure. In this time of mandatory personal protective equipment requirements in healthcare facilities, protection and assessment of skin in the vulnerable postauricular area are needed. This article presents a case report of a pressure injury on the ear, reviews the anatomy of the ear, and provides strategies for assessment and treatment of pressure injuries in this often overlooked anatomic region. Treating Mask-Related Pressure Injury: Begin by removing the offending device. If the patient continues to require a mask, provide a mask or “ear saver” mask strap that secures around the head or back of the neck rather than the ear, although again, this does not remove the need for continued skin assessment to areas subjected to pressure and friction. Infection should be considered and ruled out. Local cellulitis is characterized by warmth, redness, pain, and swelling. Presence of purulent discharge might indicate deeper infection and/or abscess. If infection is present, treatment should be initiated with topical and/or systemic antibiotics, depending on culture and severity. Removing hair in the area may be helpful, because it eliminates foreign body intrusion into the wound base, as well as a source of contamination, consistent with the principles of wound bed preparation. It is important to note that a healed wound may not have the same physical strength as normal tissue and may be prone to recurrence, also known as recidivism.","Mark wearing is now present everywhere. This is because of the COVID-19 pandemic (a global, viral, respiratory illness).

Local cellulitis (bacterial skin infection) is characterized by warmth, redness, pain, and swelling. Presence of pus might indicate a deeper infection and/or abscess (swollen area with pus). If there is signs of infection, treatment should be initiated with topical treatment (applied directly to the skin) and/or systemic antibiotics (drugs that affect the whole body). Treatment method chosen will depend on the skin health and severity of infection. Removing hair in the area may be helpful. This may be helpful as it eliminates things that may stray into the wound. Additionally, hair is a source of contamination. It is important to understand that a healed wound may not have the same physical strength as normal tissue.

17,1233473,"180 cases of head trauma were classified according to the degree of impairment of consciousness, clinical and neurological symptoms and EEG patterns. Based on the radiological and clinical findings and blood gas analyses a study was made of the incidence and extent of aspiration of blood, vomit or debris into the tracheo-bronchial tree and of the resultant pulmonary complications. As loss of consciousness became more complete the incidence of aspiration and the amount of material inhaled increased. Clinically and radiologically proven aspiration occurred in 60 per cent of cases of severe head trauma. A comparison of two groups after they had been given first aid and artificial respiration showed that the paO2 values were significantly lower in patients with radiologically proven aspiration and infiltration of the lungs than they were in those with normal chest radiograms. These observations point to the relationship between the quantity of material inhaled and the extent of intra-pulmonary shunting. There was no difference in the incidence of aspiration between persons who had been intubated and those who had not been intubated prior to admission to hospital. Although in many cases of head trauma aspiration of blood immediately after the accident can not be prevented prompt intubation is the only measure that will mitigate the consequences of aspiration and prevent its recurrence. As the latter is a very real risk in the unconscious person intubation in these cases is a ""must"". The study also showed that aspiration of foreign material into the tracheobronchial system and the resultant pulmonary complications can be successfully treated even if the head trauma is very severe. In none of the cases studied was death attributable to these causes. Apart from intubation and bronchial toilet artificial respiration with oxygen-enriched gas mixtures has a decisive influence on the course of the aspiration-induced pulmonary complications.","We divided 180 cases of head injury based on the level of loss of wakefulness and awareness, medical and brain-related symptoms observed by a doctor, and a common brain function test. Based on x-rays, symptoms observed by a doctor, and blood gas tests, we studied how often and how much blood, vomit or debris entered the airways and the lung complications that occurred as a result. As consciousness went away, how often material entered the airways and the amount of material breathed in increased. Material entering the airways happened in 60 percent of cases of severe head injury based on symptoms observed by a doctor and x-rays. A comparison of two groups after they received first aid and artificial aid to breathe showed that the levels of oxygen dissolved in the blood were much lower in patients with x-rays that showed material entered the airways and the lungs than those with normal chest x-rays. These findings suggest a relationship between the amount of material breathed in and how much blood put out by the heart lacks enough oxygen. Persons who had a breathing tube and those who did not before admission to the hospital did not differ in how often material entered the airways. Although often in head injuries blood entering the airways after the accident cannot be prevented quickly, putting in a breathing tube is the only thing that will lessen the consequences of material entering the airways and prevent it from happening again. As the second result is a very real risk in the unconscious person, putting in a breathing tube in these cases is a ""must"". The study also showed that material from outside the body entering the airways and the lung complications that occurred as a result can be successfully treated even if the head injury is very severe. In the cases we looked at, death did not result from any of these causes. Aside from putting in a breathing tube and clearing mucus and secretions from the airways, substituting a person's breathing with gas mixtures with high levels of oxygen plays a big role in lung complications from material entering the airways.","180 cases of head trauma were classified by severity of damage to consciousness, medical and brain-related effects, and brain activity measurements. Based on x-rays, medical findings, and blood analyses, the frequency and extent of breathing in blood, vomit, or debris into the lungs and of its effects were measured. As consciousness decreased, the frequency and extent of breathing in material increased. Medically and x-ray proven breathing in of fluid occured in 60% of reports of severe head trauma. Comparing two groups after both received first aid and artificial breathing showed that oxygen was lower in patients with x-ray proven breathing in of fluids in the lungs than unaffected patients. A relationship exists between the amount inhaled and extent of fluid moved into the lungs. There was no change in the frequency of breathing in fluids between patients with breathing tubes and those without before arriving to the hospital. In many cases, while breathing in of blood cannot be stopped after head trauma, prompt use of breathing tubes is the only way to lessen the effects of breathing in fluids and prevent its return. Breathing in fluids again is a serious risk. For unconscious patients, breathing tubes are a ""must"". The study showed that breathing in foreign material into the lungs and the resulting effects can be treated even with severe head trauma. In no cases studied was death owing to these causes. Besides adding tubes and removing lung waste, artificial breathing in of oxygen-enriched gases greatly influence breathing-related effects."

Serum from 26 subjects had been stored for 1-11 yr before the G.T.T.S were done. The titres in some were shown to rise and fall over the years, while in others they remained remarkably constant. There was no correlation between the titre, change in titre or the duration of I.C.Ab or the presence of HLA-B8, BW15, or CW3 and the result of the G.T.T. In addition to acting as a marker for asymptomatic and latent diabetes and prediabetes, it seems that the presence of I.C.Ab in the serum may define a new group of potential diabetics with normal G.T.T.S. Many such subjects have one or more organ-specific autoimmune disorders (irrespective of diabetic family history), but some are first-degree relatives of I.C.Ab-positive subjects (mainly I.D.D.). About 0-5% of the general population also have I.C.Ab in their serum.","We found pancreatic islet-cell antibodies (I.C.Ab; proteins made against insulin-producing cells in the pancreas) in 31 patients with disorders where the body's defense system attacks certain organs; 4 parents, siblings, or children of people with I.C.Ab-positive diabetes, and 1 apparently normal person, none of whom had symptoms of diabetes. Of these 36 people, glucose (sugar molecule)-tolerance tests (G.T.T.S) showed 10 had diabetes, 4 had lag storage (normal glucose levels spike and return to normal), and 22 had normal results. Two people had latent diabetes (slow progressing with features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes) while pregnant and thyrotoxicosis (too much metabolism-regulating thyroid hormone in the body) and another 2 later developed type 1 diabetes. Blood from 26 people had been stored for 1-11 years before we did the oral (by mouth) tests that measures the body's response to sugar (glucose). I.C.Ab measurements rose and fell in some patients and stayed constant in other patients. No relationship existed between the measurement, change in measurement, or the length of I.C.Ab or the presence of antigens (substances that causes the body to defend itself) and the G.T.T. result. I.C.Ab in the blood can indicate diabetes without symptoms and slow-progressing diabetes and prediabetes and may signal a new group of possible diabetics with normal G.T.T.S. Many possible diabetics with normal G.T.T.S. have at least one disorder where the body's defense system attacks certain organs (regardless of family history of diabetes), but some are parents, siblings, or children of people with I.C.Ab (mainly type 1 diabetes). About 0-5% of the general population also have I.C.Ab in their blood.",
53,23831240,"Objectives: Afternoon napping is a common habit in China. We used data obtained from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort to examine if duration of habitual afternoon napping was associated with risks for impaired fasting plasma glucose (IFG) and diabetes mellitus (DM) in a Chinese elderly population. Methods: A total of 27,009 participants underwent a physical examination, laboratory tests, and face-to-face interview. They were categorized into four groups according to nap duration (no napping, <30, 30 to <60, 60 to <90, and > or =90 min). Logistic regression models were used to examine the odds ratios (ORs) of napping duration with IFG and DM. Results: Of the participants, 18,515 (68.6%) reported regularly taking afternoon naps. Those with longer nap duration had considerably higher prevalence of IFG and DM. Napping duration was associated in a dose-dependent manner with IFG and DM (P<.001). After adjusting for possible confounders, longer nap duration (>60 min; all P<.05) was still significantly associated with increased risk for IFG, and longer nap duration (>30 min) was associated with increased risk for DM; however, this finding was not significant in the group with a nap duration of 60-90 min. Conclusions: Longer habitual afternoon napping was associated with a moderate increase for DM risk, independent of several covariates. This finding suggests that longer nap duration may represent a novel risk factor for DM and higher blood glucose levels.","Afternoon napping is a common habit in China.

49,33958571,"BACKGROUND Lipedema is a common condition that presents as excessive fat deposition in the extremities, initially sparing the trunk, ankles, and feet, and is found mainly in women, usually occurring after puberty or pregnancy. Lipedema can progress to include lipo-lymphedema of the ankles and feet. This report is of a 41-year old woman with Stage 3 lipedema and lipo-lymphedema with excessive fat of the lower body since puberty, with progression to swollen ankles and feet despite dietary caloric restriction. CASE REPORT A 41-year-old woman noticed increased fat in her legs since age 12. Her weight and leg size increased until age 21, when she reached a maximum weight of 165 kg, and underwent a Roux-En-Y gastric bypass. Over 12 months, she lost 74.8 kg. Her trunk significantly reduced in weight, but her legs did not. Fifteen years later, during recovery from hysterectomy surgery, she became progressively weaker and swollen over her entire body. Laboratory test results showed hypoalbuminemia (2.0 g/dL), lymphopenia, and hypolipoproteinemia. She was diagnosed with protein and calorie malnutrition with marked gut edema requiring prolonged parenteral nutrition. After restoration of normal protein, her health returned and her pitting edema resolved, but her extremities remained enlarged. She was subsequently diagnosed with lipedema. CONCLUSIONS This report demonstrates that early and correct diagnosis of lipedema is important, as women who believe the condition is due to obesity may suffer the consequences of calorie or protein-calorie deficiency in an attempt to lose weight.","Lipedema is a common condition where there is too much fat in the arms and legs and is found mainly in women, usually occurring after puberty (when a child's body changes to become an adult) or pregnancy. Lipedema can progress to include lipo-lymphedema, which is a build up of fluid in addition to excess fat, in the ankles and feet. This report is of a 41-year old woman with Stage 3 lipedema and lipo-lymphedema with excessive fat of the lower body since puberty. The woman's condition has advanced to swollen ankles and feet despite being on a low calorie diet. The 41-year-old woman noticed increased fat in her legs since age 12. Her weight and leg size increased until age 21, when she reached a maximum weight of 364 pounds (165 kg), and had a procedure called gastric bypass that involves a doctor placing a small pouch in the stomach and food only goes into that pouch. Over 12 months, she lost 165 pounds (74.8 kg). Her trunk (chest, stomach, and back) significantly reduced in weight, but her legs did not. Fifteen years later, during recovery from surgery, she became continuously weaker and swollen over her entire body. Lab test results showed hypoalbuminemia (low levels of the albumin protein in the blood), making it harder to move substances in the body. Tests also show low levels of white blood cells and low levels of fat lipids in the blood. She was not eating enough protein and energy (through calories) to meet nutritional needs with edema (swelling) in the stomach, requiring that more nutrition be given through the vein. After restoring protein to normal levels, her health returned and her pitting edema due to excess fluid resolved, but her arms and legs remained enlarged. She was later diagnosed with lipedema. In conclusion, this report shows that early and correct diagnosis of lipedema is important.

32,15226090,"Objectives: Elevated plasma homocysteine has been implicated as a risk factor for hypertension. C677T polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) is a major determinant of hyperhomocysteinemia, which results in endothelial dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to remedy the endothelial dysfunction and restore endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. The co-existence of genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes, targets, receptors, and transporters may influence the drug efficacy. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether short-term blood pressure control by benazepril, an ACE inhibitor, was modulated by C677T MTHFR gene polymorphism. Methods and results: A total of 444 hypertensive patients, aged 27 to 65 years, without any anti hypertensive therapy within 2 weeks were included. All of them were treated orally with benazepril at a single daily fixed dosage of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured at baseline and on the 16th day of treatment. Among them, the frequency of MTHFR C677T genotype CC, CT and TT was 24.3%, 51.8%, and 23.9%, respectively. In a recessive model (CC+CT versus TT genotype), both baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and diastolic blood pressure response (DeltaDBP) were significantly higher in patients with the TT genotype than in those with the CT or CC genotype (P value=0.0076 for DBP, and P value=0.0005 for DeltaDBP). We further divided all patients into three groups based on the tertiles of the DeltaBP distribution. Compared to subjects in the lowest tertile of DeltaDBP, the adjusted relative odds of having the TT genotype among subjects in the highest tertile was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.4 to 4.9). However, baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and SBP response did not significantly associate with MTHFR C677T polymorphism. Conclusions: Our finding suggests that MTHFR C667T polymorphism modulated baseline DBP and DBP responsiveness by short-term treatment of ACE inhibitor in Chinese essential hypertensive patients.","Increased blood levels of homocysteine, a specific chemical, may be a risk factor for high blood pressure. A specific mutation in DNA (C677T) encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a protein that transforms homocysteine, greatly influences hyperhomocysteinemia, or high blood levels of homocysteine. This condition results in damage to cells that line the heart and blood vessels. Blood pressure medication called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors seem to repair damage to cells lining the heart and blood vessels and restore blood vessel widening. The co-existence of varied DNA for drug-digesting enzymes, targets, target sites, and transporters may affect drug effect. This study investigates if short-term blood pressure control by benazepril, an ACE inhibitor, was affected by variation in the DNA sequence for the C667T MTHFR gene. 444 patients with high blood pressure, aged 27 to 65 years, without any high blood pressure therapy within 2 weeks were included. All of them swallowed benazepril at a single daily fixed dose of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured at start and on the 16th day of treatment. Among them, the gene sequence for MTHFR C677T varied. Diastolic blood pressure at the start and end were much higher for patients with a certain DNA sequence for the MTHFR C677T gene than patients with two other DNA sequences. We then divided all patients into 3 groups based on the distribution of blood pressure readings at the study's end. Compared to those with the lowest blood pressure measurements, the chances of having a certain DNA sequence for the MTHFR C667T gene among those with the highest blood pressure readings was 2.6 times higher. However, systolic blood pressure at the start and end was not linked to DNA sequences. DNA sequence variation for the MTHFR C667T gene affects diastolic blood pressure at the study's start and end in Chinese essential patients with high blood pressure.","Increase plasma, or blood, homocysteine has been identified as a risk factor for hypertension (high blood pressure). Homocysteine is a chemical your body produces to help make proteins. An identified genetic variation or gene type within the human population is a major determinant of hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a condition with excess homocysteine in the blood. The condition can result in endothelial dysfunction, or a heart disease where the blood vessels narrow instead of opening. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a type of drug commonly used to treat high blood pressure. ACE Inhibitors appear to fix the endothelial (or blood vessel lining) dysfunction and allow blood vessels to open. The presence of the genetic variation in specific bodily locations that metabolize or digest drugs, such as enzymes and receptors, may influence how well a drug works. The goal of this study was to investigate if short-term blood pressure control by an ACE inhibitor (Benazepril) is effected by the identified genetic variation. A total of 444 hypertensive patients, aged 27 to 65 years, without any anti hypertensive therapy within 2 weeks were included. All patients were treated with Benazepril with a single, daily dose of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured prior to the study beginning (baseline) and on the 16th day of treatment. The unique genetic variation has three unique ""versions"" or genotypes, known as CC, CT, or TT. Among the patients, the frequency of the genetic variation genotype CC, CT, and TT was 24.3%, 51.8%, and 23.9%, respectively. In a statistical analysis, several blood pressure measurements were higher in patients with the TT genotype than those with the CT or CC genotype. The authors further divided all patients into three groups based on where their diastolic blood pressure response (DeltaDBP) fell within a population scale. Diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure when the heart is relaxed. Patients with the highest DeltaDBP had the highest chance of having the TT genotype. However, baseline systolic blood pressure (when the heart is contracting) was not significantly associated with the unique genetic variation. This study suggests that the unique genetic variation altered baseline DBP by short-term treatment of ACE inhibitor in hypertensive patients."

41,18497742,"In patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) arise from renal tubular epithelial cells containing biallelic inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene. However, it is presumed that formation of renal cysts and their conversion to ccRCC involve additional genetic changes at other loci. Here, we show that cystic lesions in the kidneys of patients with VHL disease also demonstrate activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Strikingly, combined conditional inactivation of Vhlh and the Pten tumour suppressor gene, which normally antagonises PI3K signalling, in the mouse kidney, elicits cyst formation after short latency, whereas inactivation of either tumour suppressor gene alone failed to produce such a phenotype. Interestingly, cells lining these cysts frequently lack a primary cilium, a microtubule-based cellular antenna important for suppression of uncontrolled kidney epithelial cell proliferation and cyst formation. Our results support a model in which the PTEN tumour suppressor protein cooperates with pVHL to suppress cyst development in the kidney.","In patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, kidney cysts (growths) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a type of kidney cancer, come from cells in the kidneys called epithelial cells that inactivate (or turn off) the VHL gene. The VHL gene keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast. However, it is believed that formation of kidney cysts and their change to the ccRCC kidney cancer involve additional genetic changes at other locations. This study shows that cystic wounds in the kidneys of patients with VHL disease also show activation of the enzyme called phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which regulates key cells processes. When two genes called Vhlh and Pten that keep cells from growing too fast are turned off, this brings about cyst formation in the kidneys of mice after a short delay. However, inactivation of only one of these genes fails to produce this same effect. Interestingly, cells lining these cysts frequently lack primary cilium, that acts like a cell antenna and is important for stopping or slowing kidney epithelial cells from multiplying and for stopping cyst formation. These results support a model in which the PTEN tumor suppressor protein cooperates with pVHL to stop cyst development in the kidney.",
15,32673289,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes regulate transcription through epigenetic modification of chromatin structure, but their specific functions in the kidney remain elusive. We discovered that the human kidney expresses class I HDACs. Kidney medulla-specific inhibition of class I HDACs in the rat during high-salt feeding results in hypertension, polyuria, hypokalemia, and nitric oxide deficiency. Three new inducible murine models were used to determine that HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the kidney epithelium are necessary for maintaining epithelial integrity and maintaining fluid-electrolyte balance during increased dietary sodium intake. Moreover, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing determined that epithelial HDAC1 and HDAC2 are necessary for expression of many sodium or water transporters and channels. In performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of serious adverse events associated with clinical HDAC inhibitor use, we found that HDAC inhibitors increased the odds ratio of experiencing fluid-electrolyte disorders, such as hypokalemia. This study provides insight on the mechanisms of potential serious adverse events with HDAC inhibitors, which may be fatal to critically ill patients. In conclusion, kidney tubular HDACs provide a link between the environment, such as consumption of high-salt diets, and regulation of homeostatic mechanisms to remain in fluid-electrolyte balance.","Histone deacetylase (HDAC) are enzymes that control transcription (the process of copying a segment of DNA into messenger RNA, or mRNA, for protein creation), but their specific functions in the kidney are unknown. Researchers discovered that the human kidney uses class I HDACs to activate or build molecules or proteins. The slowing or stopping of class I HDACs from the kidney medulla region in rats during high-salt feedings results in diseases such as hypertension (high blood pressure) and hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood). Three new animal studies are used to determine that HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the kidney epithelium (cells that cover the inner surface of organs) are necessary for maintaining electrolyte (minerals in the body) balance when the body takes in increased sodium. Additionally, epithelial HDAC1 and HDAC2 are necessary for activating many sodium or water transporters and channels across cells. In reviewing all relevant studies of serious side effects connected with clinical HDAC inhibitor use, researchers found that HDAC inhibitors (molecules or enzymes that block actions of an enzyme protein) increased the chance of experiencing fluid-electrolyte disorders (a group of conditions caused by a temporary disturbance in the body's levels of fluids and electrolytes), such as hypokalemia. This study provides a greater understanding of potential serious side effects with HDAC inhibitors, which may be fatal to very ill patients. In conclusion, HDACs from the kidney provide a link between the environment, such as consuming high-salt diets, and regulating processes to stay in fluid-electrolyte balance.",
46,29402832,"Background/aims: The CFTR-Associated Ligand (CAL), a PDZ domain containing protein with two coiled-coil domains, reduces cell surface WT CFTR through degradation in the lysosome by a well-characterized mechanism. However, CAL's regulatory effect on ΔF508 CFTR has remained almost entirely uninvestigated. Methods: In this study, we describe a previously unknown pathway for CAL by which it regulates the membrane expression of ΔF508 CFTR through arrest of ΔF508 CFTR trafficking in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) using a combination of cell biology, biochemistry and electrophysiology. Results: We demonstrate that CAL is an ER localized protein that binds to ΔF508 CFTR and is degraded in the 26S proteasome. When CAL is inhibited, ΔF508 CFTR retention in the ER decreases and cell surface expression of mature functional ΔF508 CFTR is observed alongside of enhanced expression of plasma membrane scaffolding protein NHERF1. Chaperone proteins regulate this novel process, and ΔF508 CFTR binding to HSP40, HSP90, HSP70, VCP, and Aha1 changes to improve ΔF508 CFTR cell surface trafficking. Conclusion: Our results reveal a pathway in which CAL regulates the cell surface availability and intracellular retention of ΔF508 CFTR.","The CFTR-Associated Ligand (CAL) reduces the cell surface of normal CFTR through destroying it in a well-understood way. The CFTR protein is a channel involved with movement of ions (charged atoms) and fluids in epithelial cells (cells that cover the outer surface of the internal organs). However, few scientists have studied how CAL controls ΔF508 CFTR, a specific gene sequence change seen in the CFTR gene which slightly alters the CFTR protein. In this study, we describe a previously unknown way CAL controls ΔF508 CFTR through stopping ΔF508 CFTR movement in the cell's transportation system. We show that CAL binds to ΔF508 CFTR in one location of the cell and is destroyed in another location of the cell. When CAL is stopped, the amount of ΔF508 CFTR held within the cell decreases and working ΔF508 CFTR is seen on the cell surface. The binding of ΔF508 CFTR to proteins improves the cell surface movement conducted by ΔF508 CFTR. We conclude that CAL controls the cell surface availability and amount held within the cell of ΔF508 CFTR.",
13,11403753,"Background: For patients presenting with atrial fibrillation of only a few weeks duration, the use of transesophageal echocardiography offers the opportunity to markedly abbreviate the duration of atrial fibrillation before cardioversion. We sought to determine if the shorter duration of atrial fibrillation allowed by a transesophageal echocardiography strategy had an impact on the recurrence of atrial fibrillation and prevalence of sinus rhythm during the first year following cardioversion. Methods: Transesophageal echocardiography was attempted in 539 patients (292 men, 247 women; 71.6 +/- 13.0 years.) with atrial fibrillation > or =2 days (66.1% <3 weeks) or of unknown duration before elective cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. Therapeutic anticoagulation at the time of transesophageal echocardiography was present in 94.6% of patients, and 73.4% of subjects were discharged on warfarin. Results: Atrial thrombi were identified in 70 (13.1%) patients. Successful cardioversion in 413 patients without evidence of atrial thrombi was associated with clinical thromboembolism in 1 patient (0.24%, 95% confidence interval: 0.0--0.8%). In patients with atrial fibrillation <3 weeks at the time of cardioversion (a duration incompatible with conventional therapy of 3 to 4 weeks of warfarin before cardioversion), the 1-year atrial fibrillation recurrence rate was lower (41.1% vs. 57.9%, P <0.01), and the prevalence of sinus rhythm at 1 year was increased (65.8% vs. 51.3%, P <0.03). No other clinical or echocardiographic index was associated with recurrence of atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm at 1 year. Conclusions: Early cardioversion facilitated by transesophageal echocardiography has a favorable safety profile and provides the associated benefit of reduced recurrence of atrial fibrillation for patients in whom the duration of atrial fibrillation is <3 weeks.","Atrial fibrillation is a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots or stroke. For patients that had atrial fibrillation for only a few weeks, using a test that produces pictures of the heart called transesophageal echocardiography is an opportunity to shorten the duration of atrial fibrillation before cardioversion, a procedure used to return an irregular or very fast heartbeat to a normal rhythm. Researchers aimed to find out if the shorter time period of atrial fibrillation from using transesophageal echocardiography impacts how often atrial fibrillation returns and the frequency of sinus rhythm in the first year after cardioversion. Sinus rhythm is the pattern of your heartbeat based on the sinus node of your heart which sends out electrical pulses. Transesophageal echocardiography is used in 539 patients who had atrial fibrillation for two or more days (more than half had atrial fibrillation for less than 3 weeks) or for an unknown duration before non-emergency cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. Blood thinners at the time of the transesophageal echocardiography were used in almost all patients, and 73.4% were discharged on warfarin, a blood thinner to prevent blood clots. Heart-related blood clots were found in 70 (13.1%) patients. Among patients who successfully had the cardioversion procedure, 1 patient had clinical thromboembolism, a blood clot in the vein. In the patients who had atrial fibrillation for less than 3 weeks at the time of cardioversion, the return of atrial fibrillation in the first year was lower, and the frequency of sinus rhythm at 1 year increased. No other clincal or heart evaluations are associated with returning atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm at 1 year. Having the cardioversion procedure earlier by using the transesophageal echocardiography is shown to be a safe method and is associated with reducing the return of atrial fibrillation in patients who have had the heart condition for less than 3 weeks.",
16,6445384,"The effects of single oral doses of 10, 15, or 30 mg of prednisone on circulating mononuclear cells, autologous MLR, mitogen responses, and allogeneic MLR were studied in healthy volunteers. Doses as low as 10 mg were immunosuppressive, causing diminution of circulating T cells and monocytes, and significant reduction in autologous but not allogeneic MLR responses. These effects were maximal 6 hr after drug administration and gone by 24 hr. Autologous MLR responses were particularly sensitive to the effects of prednisone being significantly and consistently suppressed 2 hr after drug administration, before significant cell redistribution had occurred. Macrophage-enriched stimulating cells were more easily suppressed than responding T cells. Since the autologous MLR may be important in in vivo regulation of immune responses, its reduction by low-dose glucocorticoids may be of clinical relevance. This suppressive effect must be considered in studies of the autologous MLR in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy.","The effects of single oral (by mouth) doses of prednisone (a type of man-made steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling) on circulating mononuclear cells (major cells in the body that signal the immune system), autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) (the availability of non T-cells to stimulate T-cells), mitogen responses (to help measure immune response), and allogeneic MLR (grouping of white blood cells called lymphocytes from unrelated individuals resulting in T cell activation) are studied in healthy volunteers. Low doses were immunosuppressive (drugs or medicines that lower the body's ability to reject a transplanted organ), causing reduced circulation and amounts of T-cells (a type of immune cell that help protect the body from infection) and monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria that enter the body), and major losses in autologous but not allogeneic MLR responses. The maximum effect occurred 6 hours after the drug is provided, and effects are gone by 24 hours. Autologous MLR responses are very sensitive to the effects of prednisone and were significantly and consistently slowed or stopped 2 hours after the drug was provided. Macrophage-enriched stimulating cells (a type of white blood cell that surrounds and kills foreign organisms like bacteria and activates other immune system cells) were more easily slowed than responding T cells. Because autologous MLR may be important in in vivo (experiments within a living human or animal) monitoring of immune responses, its reduction by low dose glucocorticoids (medicines that fight inflammation and work with your immune system) may be important. This suppressive (slowing down) effect must be considered in studies of the autologous MLR in patients receiving glucocorticoid drugs.",

The impact of fractures includes loss of function, significant costs, and increased mortality. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry to screen all women 65 years and older, and younger women who have an increased fracture risk as determined by the World Health Organization's FRAX Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. Although guidelines are lacking for rescreening women who have normal bone mineral density on initial screening, intervals of at least four years appear safe. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening for osteoporosis in men; other organizations recommend screening all men 70 years and older. In patients with newly diagnosed osteoporosis, suggested laboratory tests to identify secondary causes include serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, creatinine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. First-line treatment to prevent fractures consists of fall prevention, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake, and bisphosphonate therapy. Clinicians should consider discontinuing bisphosphonate therapy after five years in women without a personal history of vertebral fractures. Raloxifene, teriparatide, and denosumab are alternative effective treatments for certain subsets of patients and for those who are unable to take or whose condition does not respond to bisphosphonates. The need for follow-up bone mineral density testing in patients receiving treatment for osteoporosis is uncertain.","Bone breaks due to osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) happen in about 50% of white women and 20% of white men in their lifetime. Bone breaks cause loss of physical function, high costs, and increased death.

Although there are not guidelines for rechecking women who have initial normal bone mineral density, four years between checks looks safe. The expert panel did not find enough proof to recommend checking for osteoporosis in men; other groups recommend checking all men 70 years and older. In people with newly found osteoporosis, lab tests to find underlying causes include measuring blood levels of different substances. The best treatment to prevent breaks includes preventing falls, stopping smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, and a group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning. Doctors should think about stopping a group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning after five years in women without a history of spine breaks.

13,20208092,"Circadian variation in atrial fibrillation (AF) frequency is explored in this paper by employing recent advances in signal processing. Once the AF frequency has been estimated and tracked by a hidden Markov model approach, the resulting trend is analyzed for the purpose of detecting and characterizing the presence of circadian variation. With cosinor analysis, the results show that the short-term variations in the AF frequency exceed the variation that may be attributed to circadian. Using the autocorrelation method, circadian variation was found in 13 of 18 ambulatory ECG recordings (Holter) acquired from patients with long-standing persistent AF. Using the ensemble correlation method, the highest AF frequency usually occurred during the afternoon, whereas the lowest usually occurred during late night. It is concluded that circadian variation is present in most patients with long-standing persistent AF though the short-term variation in the AF frequency is considerable and should be taken into account.","Circadian variation (a part of the natural, internal process that regulates the sleep–wake cycle) in atrial fibrillation (a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots or stroke) frequency is explored in this paper by using recent advances in signal processing, which monitors the heart's electrical activity.

RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives are possible depending on swab type and time since symptom onset. Aim: To determine how the probability of obtaining a false-negative test in infected patients is affected by time since symptom onset and swab type. Methods: We used generalised additive mixed models to analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once. Results: The probability of a positive test decreased with time since symptom onset, with oropharyngeal (OP) samples less likely to yield a positive result than nasopharyngeal (NP) samples. The probability of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was considerably reduced if negative tests were repeated 24 hours later. For a small false-positive test probability (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests. For a higher false-positive test probability, the true number of infected individuals was smaller than the number of positive tests. Conclusion: NP samples are more sensitive than OP samples. The later an infected individual is tested after symptom onset, the less likely they are to test positive.

27,33301246,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. Methods: In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. Results: A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. Conclusions: A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older.

Areas covered: This evaluation is of the phase 3 BLAZE-1 clinical trial, which was of bamlanivimab plus etesevimab in adult ambulatory participants with a risk factor for, and mild to moderate, Covid-19 illness. The primary outcome was Covid 19 related hospitalisation of ≥ 24 hours or death from any cause by day 29, and this occurred in 2.1% subjects in the bamlanivimab/etesevimab group, compared to 7.0% in the placebo group. Expert opinion: In the pandemic, the attempts by the FDA to shorten approval processes for medicines and by journals to make information available in a timely manner are admirable. However, these shortened processes made negotiating the details of BLAZE-1 and producing accurate and critical appraisals difficult. It seems to me, that if there are any benefits of bamlanivimab alone in Covid-19, they are not clear-cut. Bamlanivimab has limited effects against the beta and gamma variants and is not effective against the delta variant.

19,32651292,"Objective: We tested the hypothesis that there are 2 distinct phenotypes of Parkinson tremor, based on interindividual differences in the response of resting tremor to dopaminergic medication. We also investigated whether this pattern is specific to tremor by comparing interindividual differences in the dopamine response of tremor to that of bradykinesia. Methods: In this exploratory study, we performed a levodopa challenge in 76 tremulous patients with Parkinson tremor. Clinical scores (Movement Disorders Society-sponsored version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III) were collected ""off"" and ""on"" a standardized dopaminergic challenge (200/50 mg dispersible levodopa-benserazide). In both sessions, resting tremor intensity was quantified using accelerometry, both during rest and during cognitive coactivation. Bradykinesia was quantified using a speeded keyboard test. We calculated the distribution of dopamine-responsiveness for resting tremor and bradykinesia. In 41 patients, a double-blinded, placebo-controlled dopaminergic challenge was repeated after approximately 6 months. Results: The dopamine response of resting tremor, but not bradykinesia, significantly departed from a normal distribution. A cluster analysis on 3 clinical and electrophysiologic markers of tremor dopamine-responsiveness revealed 3 clusters: dopamine-responsive, intermediate, and dopamine-resistant tremor. A repeated levodopa challenge after 6 months confirmed this classification. Patients with dopamine-responsive tremor had greater disease severity and tended to have a higher prevalence of dyskinesia. Conclusion: Parkinson resting tremor can be divided into 3 partially overlapping phenotypes, based on the dopamine response. These tremor phenotypes may be associated with different underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, requiring a different therapeutic approach.","We tested if there are 2 different types of Parkinson tremors, or body shakes due to a brain-related disease affecting movement, based on individualized responses to medication altering levels of dopamine, a chemical messenger.

We tested responsiveness to levodopa (a Parkinson's medication) in 76 patients with Parkinson tremors, or shakes by a brain-related disease affecting movement.   In 41 patients, a dopamine-sensitivty test was repeated after around 6 months. The dopamine response of resting tremor, but not bradykinesia, was atypical. There were 3 types of tremor dopamine-responsiveness: dopamine-responsive, intermediate, and dopamine-resistant tremor. A levodopa sensitivity test 6 months later matched these tremor response categories. Patients with dopamine-responsive tremors had higher disease severity and frequency of impaired movement. Parkinson resting tremors has 3 physical trait types, based on dopamine response. These tremor patterns may be linked with unrevealed biological processes and need different treatments.","Researchers tested the idea that there are 2 distinct phenotypes (observable traits or characteristics) of Parkinson tremor based on differences among people in how the resting tremor (a tremor when the muscle is relaxed) responds to dopamine medication.

Bradykinesia is measured using a speeded keyboard test. The distribution (the movement of a drug to and from the blood and different tissues of the body) of dopamine-responsiveness for resting tremor and bradykinesia is calculated. In 41 patients, a dopamine challenge is repeated after about 6 months. The dopamine response of resting tremor, but not bradykinesia, significantly departed from normal in the body. An analysis of brain activity revealed 3 clusters: dopamine-responsive, intermediate, and dopamine-resistant tremor. A repeated levodopa challenge after 6 months confirmed these clusters. Patients with dopamine-responsive tremor have greater disease severity and tend to have a higher amount of dyskinesia (involuntary and uncontrollable movements). In conclusion, Parkinson resting tremor can be divided into 3 partially overlapping characteristics based on dopamine response. These tremor characteristics may be connected with different underlying functional changes that come with Parkinson's disease, requiring a different treatment approach."

So far, about 1000 cases have been reported worldwide. These hernias are difficult to diagnose as they do not present with a subcutaneous swelling and have high risk of going for strangulation. We discuss the case of a 36 year old female who presented with history of pain and lumpiness in left lower abdomen, both of which decreased on lying down. She presented to emergency with an episode severe pain at same site which subsided spontaneously. Diagnosis was confirmed on CT scan, plication and onlay prolene mesh repair performed.

38,29025198,"Background: Pressure ulcers, also known as pressure injuries and bed sores, are localised areas of injury to the skin or underlying tissues, or both. Dressings made from a variety of materials, including foam, are used to treat pressure ulcers. An evidence-based overview of dressings for pressure ulcers is needed to enable informed decision-making on dressing use. This review is part of a suite of Cochrane Reviews investigating the use of dressings in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Each review will focus on a particular dressing type. Objectives: To assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of foam wound dressings for healing pressure ulcers in people with an existing pressure ulcer in any care setting. Main results: We included nine trials with a total of 483 participants, all of whom were adults (59 years or older) with an existing pressure ulcer Category/Stage II or above. All trials had two arms, which compared foam dressings with other dressings for treating pressure ulcers. The certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low due to various combinations of selection, performance, attrition, detection and reporting bias, and imprecision due to small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. We had very little confidence in the estimate of effect of included studies. Where a foam dressing was compared with another foam dressing, we established that the true effect was likely to be substantially less than the study's estimated effect. We present data for four comparisons. One trial compared a silicone foam dressing with another (hydropolymer) foam dressing (38 participants), with an eight-week (short-term) follow-up. It was uncertain whether alternate types of foam dressing affected the incidence of healed pressure ulcers (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.75) or adverse events (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.25), as the certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for serious limitations in study design and very serious imprecision. Four trials with a median sample size of 20 participants (230 participants), compared foam dressings with hydrocolloid dressings for eight weeks or less (short-term). It was uncertain whether foam dressings affected the probability of healing in comparison to hydrocolloid dressings over a short follow-up period in three trials (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.34), very low-certainty evidence, downgraded for very serious study limitations and serious imprecision. It was uncertain if there was a difference in risk of adverse events between groups (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.11), very low-certainty evidence, downgraded for serious study limitations and very serious imprecision. Reduction in ulcer size, patient satisfaction/acceptability, pain and cost effectiveness data were also reported but we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. One trial (34 participants), compared foam and hydrogel dressings over an eight-week (short-term) follow-up. It was uncertain if the foam dressing affected the probability of healing (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.28), time to complete healing (MD 5.67 days 95% CI -4.03 to 15.37), adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.65) or reduction in ulcer size (MD 0.30 cm2 per day, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.75), as the certainty of the evidence was very low, downgraded for serious study limitations and very serious imprecision. The remaining three trials (181 participants) compared foam with basic wound contact dressings. Follow-up times ranged from short-term (8 weeks or less) to medium-term (8 to 24 weeks). It was uncertain whether foam dressings affected the probability of healing compared with basic wound contact dressings, in the short term (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.88) or medium term (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.72), or affected time to complete healing in the medium term (MD -35.80 days, 95% CI -56.77 to -14.83), or adverse events in the medium term (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.05). This was due to the very low-certainty evidence, downgraded for serious to very serious study limitations and imprecision. Reduction in ulcer size, patient satisfaction/acceptability, pain and cost effectiveness data were also reported but again, we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. None of the included trials reported quality of life or pressure ulcer recurrence. Authors' conclusions: It is uncertain whether foam dressings are more clinically effective, more acceptable to users, or more cost effective compared to alternative dressings in treating pressure ulcers. It was difficult to make accurate comparisons between foam dressings and other dressings due to the lack of data on reduction of wound size, complete wound healing, treatment costs, or insufficient time-frames. Quality of life and patient (or carer) acceptability/satisfaction associated with foam dressings were not systematically measured in any of the included studies. We assessed the certainty of the evidence in the included trials as low to very low. Clinicians need to carefully consider the lack of robust evidence in relation to the clinical and cost-effectiveness of foam dressings for treating pressure ulcers when making treatment decisions, particularly when considering the wound management properties that may be offered by each dressing type and the care context.","Pressure ulcers, also known as pressure injuries and bed sores, are localized areas of injury to the skin or underlying tissues, or both.

24,9600581,"In this double-blind, placebo-controlled 10-week trial, the anxiolytic properties of the nonbenzodiazepine buspirone were compared with the benzodiazepine lorazepam and placebo in 125 outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder according to DSM-III. After a 3- to 7-day wash-out period, patients were allocated at random to receive orally 3 x 5 mg buspirone (n=58), 3 x 1 mg lorazepam (n=57), or placebo (n=10) over a 4-week period. The study also comprised a 2-week taper period and a 4-week placebo-control period to assess the stability of clinical improvement. The patient's clinical state was estimated on entry and at weekly intervals by general practitioners using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment and by a self-rating scale (State Trait Anxiety Inventory X2=STAI-X2). Lorazepam treatment resulted in descriptively, but not significantly, greater improvement on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety during the whole treatment (week 0-4) and taper period (week 5, 6) than did buspirone. After treatment with active drugs had been discontinued, the 4-week placebo control period showed buspirone-treated patients to display a stability of clinical improvement, while the symptoms of lorazepam-treated patients worsened at week 7-10. Both buspirone and lorazepam were more efficacious in reducing anxiety symptoms than placebo during the treatment and taper period; however, in contrast to the active drugs (buspirone, lorazepam), patients of the placebo group showed further clinical improvement during the control period, especially in the HAM-A score, so differences between placebo and active drugs became smaller at the end of the study.","Over 10 weeks, we compared the anti-anxiety drug characteristics of the nonbenzodiazepine buspirone with the benzodiazepine lorazepam and sugar pills in 125 patients outside the hospital with generalized anxiety disorder based on the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. After a 3- to 7-day period for the body to eliminate drugs in the system, patients were randomly given 5 mg buspirone 3 times a day (58 patients), 1 mg lorazepam 3 times a day (57 patients), or sugar pills (10 patients) for four weeks. The study also included a 2-week period when drug amounts were slowly decreased and a 4-week period when all patients took sugar pills to measure the consistency of improvements in anxiety symptoms. Doctors estimated severity of anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the study and weekly using common questionnaires. Patients taking lorazepam showed slightly greater improvement in symptoms than those taking buspirone on one of the questionnaires during the whole treatment (weeks 0-4) and when drug amounts were slowly decreased (weeks 5,6), though not significantly. After patients stopped taking the studied drugs, the 4-week period when patients took sugar pills showed patients who took buspirone showed consistent improvements in anxiety symptoms, while patients who took lorazepam showed worse symptoms at weeks 7-10. Both buspirone and lorazepam worked better than sugar pills to improve anxiety symptoms during treatment and when drug amounts were slowly decreased. However, patients who took sugar pills showed improvements in anxiety symptoms when all patients took sugar pills, especially in one questionnaire, so differences between sugar pills and drugs became smaller at the end of the study.",
43,31985942,"The human heart is a pivotal organ in the circulatory system, and it beats more than 2 billion times during normal life. This functioning of the heart depends on the cardiac conduction system, which includes impulse generators (e.g., sino-atrial node) and the impulse propagating (His-Purkinje) system. The sinoatrial node acts as the natural pacemaker of the heart. The cells present in the sinus node have innate automaticity, which starts the electrical activity in the heart. This innate electrical potential moves from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node and finally into the His-Purkinje system. This movement of electric potential in an orderly manner controls the rhythmic contraction of the heart's chambers. The failure of this intrinsic electrical conduction in the heart can result in different arrhythmic problems. Several diseases and conditions affect the conduction system by involving impulse generation, impulse propagation, or both. Acquired conditions such as myocardial infarction, age-related degeneration, procedural complications, and drug toxicity are the major causes of the native conduction system malfunction. The current standard of care for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias due to conduction system diseases is the implantation of a cardiac implantable electronic device. These pacing devices provide an external electrical stimulus that leads to depolarization of myocytes and helps maintain the electrical excitability of the heart tissue. This process leads to excitation-contraction coupling resulting in the contraction of myocardial tissue.","The human heart is an important organ in the circulatory system in the body that carries blood to and from the heart.

The sinoatrial node acts as the natural pacemaker of the heart. The cells in the sinus node have natural automatic actions, which starts the electrical activity in the heart. This natural electrical potential moves from the sinoatrial node (the heart's natural pacemaker) to the atrioventricular node, a small part of the heart that intensifies these heart impulses, and finally into the His-Purkinje system.

42,30025887,"Linker histones are major players in chromatin organization and per se are essential players in genome homeostasis. As the fifth class of histone proteins the linker histones not only interact with DNA and core histones but also with other chromatin proteins. These interactions prove to be essential for the higher levels of chromatin organization like chromatin loops, transcription factories and chromosome territories. Our recent results have proved that Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone - Hho1p, physically interacts with the actin-related protein 4 (Arp4) and that the abrogation of this interaction through the deletion of the gene for the linker histone in arp4 mutant cells leads to global changes in chromatin compaction. Here, we show that the healthy interaction between the yeast linker histone and Arp4p is critical for maintaining genome stability and for controlling cellular sensitivity to different types of stress. The abolished interaction between the linker histone and Arp4p leads the mutant yeast cells to premature ageing phenotypes. Cells die young and are more sensitive to stress. These results unambiguously prove the role of linker histones and chromatin remodelling in ageing by their cooperation in pertaining higher-order chromatin compaction and thus maintaining genome stability.","Linker histones are major proteins for organizing DNA and affect the balance of genes. As the fifth type of histone proteins, the linker histones not only work with DNA and other histones but also other proteins that bind to DNA. These interactions organize certain DNA regions like DNA loops, DNA expression sites, and nucleus regions with specific DNA segments. Our recent results show that a specific histone - Hho1p - of brewer's yeast physically interacts with another protein called actin-related protein 4 (Arp4). Removing this interaction via deletion of the gene for the linker histone in arp4 mutant cells leads to global change in DNA binding. We show that healthy interaction between the yeast linker histone and Arp4p is needed for DNA stability and controlling cellular sensitity to different forms of stress. The removed link between the linker histone and Arp4p leads the mutant yeast cells to premature aging. Cells die young and are more sensitive to stress. These results show the role of linker histones and DNA-protein remodeling in aging by their role in DNA binding and maintaining DNA stability.","Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Linker histones play a major role in organizing DNA and proteins to create the nucleus (genetic material) inside cells (a process called chromatin organization) and are key players in balancing the genome, which is an organism's complete set of genetic instructions. Linker histones not only interact with DNA and other histones but also with other chromatin (DNA-attached) proteins. These interactions prove to be very important for the higher levels of chromatin organization. Recent results find that one linker histone, called Hho1p, physically interacts with another protein (Arp4) and that the removal of this interaction by deleting the gene for the linker histone leads to many changes in the physical folding of DNA structures (a process called chromatin compaction). Here, researchers show that the healthy interaction between the yeast linker histone and Arp4p is critical for keeping the genome stable and for controlling how sensitive cells are to different types of stress. The interaction that stopped between the linker histone and Arp4p leads the changed yeast cells to start aging early. Cells die young and are more sensitive to stress. These results prove the role of linker histones and chromatin changes in aging cells through their cooperation in chromatin compaction (folding of DNA structure) and thus maintaining genome stability."
46,32666337,"Human primary bronchial epithelial cells differentiated in vitro represent a valuable tool to study lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the gene coding for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator. In CF, sphingolipids, a ubiquitous class of bioactive lipids mainly associated with the outer layer of the plasma membrane, seem to play a crucial role in the establishment of the severe lung complications. Nevertheless, no information on the involvement of sphingolipids and their metabolism in the differentiation of primary bronchial epithelial cells are available so far. Here we show that ceramide and globotriaosylceramide increased during cell differentiation, whereas glucosylceramide and gangliosides content decreased. In addition, we found that apical plasma membrane of differentiated bronchial cells is characterized by a higher content of sphingolipids in comparison to the other cell membranes and that activity of sphingolipids catabolic enzymes associated with this membrane results altered with respect to the total cell activities. In particular, the apical membrane of CF cells was characterized by high levels of ceramide and glucosylceramide, known to have proinflammatory activity. On this basis, our data further support the role of sphingolipids in the onset of CF lung pathology.","Cells on the surface of the bronchi (two tubes that carry air to your lungs) extracted from humans and grown in the lab are a valuable tool to study lung disease such as cystic fibrosis (CF), an inherited disease caused by a change in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein which helps transport chloride. In CF, sphingolipids, a common type of lipids found in cell surroundings, seem to play an important role in the onset of serious lung problems. Yet information is lacking on the involvement of sphingolipids and their metabolism (digestion) in the process by which cells on the surface of the bronchi change their type. Two types of sphingolipids increased and two decreased as dividing cells changed type. Cells on the surface of the bronchi have more sphingolipids compared to surfaces of other cells.

The objective of our study is to provide technical details, results, complications, and patients' satisfaction with fURS performed under exclusive SA. Methods: We analyzed all consecutive fURS performed under SA to treat renal stones from March 2011 to February 2017. Details of technique, operative time, outcomes, need for further treatments, complications, and patients' satisfaction were evaluated. Results: Two hundred thirty-four fURS under SA were considered. SA was performed through L2-L3 vertebral interspace in 64.1%. Patients were discharged the same day of surgery. Mean stone burden was 13.5 ± 6.6 mm and mean operative time 76.9 ± 34.6 min. Single-procedure SFR was 69.7%. Further treatments were performed in 22.8%. 96.6% had no anesthesia-related complications. No Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ IIIb complications were noticed. 99.6% of patients were satisfied with SA. No cases of conversion from SA to GA occurred. Conclusion: fURS can be performed safely and efficiently under SA, taking into account a few details of the technique. Patients' satisfaction with SA is very high, and complications are rare. Although SA is usually adopted in unfit patients for GA, it may be considered as a viable alternative in fit patients.","Spinal anesthesia (SA) are medicines that numbs the back of patients to reduce pain after surgery. However, most urologists (doctors who specialize in conditions of the urinary or urine-related tract) use general anesthesia that puts a patient into a heavy sleep when doing a flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS), a procedure that uses a telescope, and occasionally a laser, to break stones in the kidney into pieces. The objective of this study is to provide technical details, results, complications, and patients' satisfaction with fURS when performed under only spinal anesthesia to numb only parts of the body. Researchers analyzed all flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS) done under spinal anesthesia to treat kidney stones from March 2011 to February 2017. Details of the technique, how long the procedure takes, results, need for additional treatments, complications, and patients' satisfaction are evaluated. There are 234 fURS procedures done under spinal anesthesia considered. SA was done in a certain area of the lower spine in 64.1%. Patients are sent home the same day of surgery. The average stone burden was 13.5 millimeters (± 6.6 millimeters), and the average procedure time is 76.9 minutes ( ± 34.6 minutes). The percentage of patients who are stone free after one procedure is 69.7%. Additional treatments are done in 22.8% of patients. Overall, 96.6% had no anesthesia-related complications.

22,32279295,"Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline loss-of-function mutations in Folliculin gene (FLCN). BHD is characterized by lower lobe-predominant pulmonary cysts with risk of pneumothorax, benign skin tumors (fibrofolliculomas), and renal cell carcinoma, often of an unusual chromophobe/oncocytic hybrid histology. The FLCN protein functions in multiple signaling and metabolic pathways including positive regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity via FLCN's GTPase (GAP) activity for Rag C, positive regulation of Wnt signaling (in mesenchymal cells), and negative regulation of TFE3 nuclear localization. Therefore, FLCN-deficient cells are predicted to have reduced mTORC1 and Wnt activity and enhanced TFE3 activity. Folliculin also has functions in autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, cell-cell adhesion, 5' AMP activated protein kinase activity, and other pathways. The specific contributions of these pathways to the lung manifestations of BHD are largely unknown. This review is focused on the pulmonary manifestations of BHD, highlighting selected recent advances in elucidating the cellular functions of FLCN and current hypotheses related to the pathogenesis of cystic lung disease in BHD, including the ""stretch hypothesis."" We also discuss important knowledge gaps in the field, including the genetic, cellular and physical mechanisms of cyst pathogenesis, and the timing of cyst initiation, which may occur during lung development.","Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is an genetic disorder caused by a loss-of-function mutations in the Folliculin gene (FLCN), a gene that stops or slows tumor growth. A common characteristic of Birt-Hogg-Dubé is pulmonary cysts (sacs filled with air in the lungs) that are mostly located in the bottom of the lung. There is also the risk of a collapsed lung, when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall, non-cancerous skin tumors, and kidney cancer. The FLCN protein has different functions in the body, including signaling to other cells and supervising the formation of other proteins. Therefore, FLCN cells that are damaged are thought to have reduced activity in other proteins and increase activity in others that may lead to the development of kidney tumors. Folliculin also has other functions including cleaning out damaged cells, helping cells connect with other cells, and working with enzymes that activate the proteins that regular cell energy and fuel.

31,29996156,"Tardive dyskinesias (TDs) are still common long-term sequelae of antipsychotic treatment. They are generally irreversible and associated with cognitive deficits, a decrease in quality of life and increased mortality. Furthermore, they potentially contribute to further stigmatization of the affected patients. However due to limited treatment options, antipsychotic drugs are still one of the cornerstones in treatment of most severe mental illnesses. Therefore, knowledge about risk factors and prevention of TDs is crucial. If TDs occur, the immediate optimization of the antipsychotic drug regimen is required. Targeted medical treatments such as VMAT - 2 inhibitors can be considered. The novel VMAT-2 inhibitors are not yet approved in Germany. Other drugs that are currently used to treat TDs include clonazepam and gingko biloba. This review summarizes the current evidence of treatment options of TDs and seeks to formulate clinical recommendations for the prevention and management of TDs.","Tardive dyskinesias (TDs) - movement disorders - are still common long-term consequences of antipsychotic drugs. TDs generally cannot be reversed and are linked with intellectual disabilities, decreased quality of life and increased death. Furthermore, TDs possibly cause patients to be viewed more negatively by society. Because of a lack of treatment options, antipsychotic drugs are still one of the main treatments for serious mental illness. Therefore, knowing about TD risk factors and prevention is very important. IF TDs happen, the amount of antipsychotic drugs prescribed must be changed quickly to an appropriate amount.

22,26877139,"Loss-of-function mutations in the folliculin gene (FLCN) on chromosome 17p cause Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD), which is associated with cystic lung disease. The risk of lung collapse (pneumothorax) in BHD patients is 50-fold higher than in the general population. The cystic lung disease in BHD is distinctive because the cysts tend to be basilar, subpleural and lentiform, differentiating BHD from most other cystic lung diseases. Recently, major advances in elucidating the primary functions of the folliculin protein have been made, including roles in mTOR and AMPK signaling via the interaction of FLCN with FNIP1/2, and cell-cell adhesion via the physical interaction of FLCN with plakophilin 4 (PKP4), an armadillo-repeat containing protein that interacts with E-cadherin and is a component of the adherens junctions. In addition, in just the last three years, the pulmonary impact of FLCN deficiency has been examined for the first time. In mouse models, evidence has emerged that AMPK signaling and cell-cell adhesion are involved in alveolar enlargement. In addition, the pathologic features of human BHD cysts have been recently comprehensively characterized. The ""stretch hypothesis"" proposes that cysts in BHD arise because of fundamental defects in cell-cell adhesion, leading to repeated respiration-induced physical stretch-induced stress and, over time, expansion of alveolar spaces particularly in regions of the lung with larger changes in alveolar volume and at weaker ""anchor points"" to the pleura. This hypothesis ties together many of the new data from cellular and mouse models of BHD and from the human pathologic studies. Critical questions remain. These include whether the consequences of stretch-induced cyst formation arise through a destructive/inflammatory program or a proliferative program (or both), whether cyst initiation involves a ""second hit"" genetic event inactivating the remaining wild-type copy of FLCN (as is known to occur in BHD-associated renal cell carcinomas), and whether cyst initiation involves exclusively the epithelial compartment versus an interaction between the epithelium and mesenchyme. Ultimately, understanding the mechanisms of cystic lung disease in BHD may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, with more than 20,000 cases reported annually in the United States alone.","Loss-of-function mutations in the folliculin gene, which helps suppress tumor growth, cause Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, which is associated with cystic lung disease, a group of diseases that cause cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs. The risk of lung collapse, which is when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall, in Birt-Hogg-Dube patients is 50 times higher than in the general population. The cystic lung disease in Birt-Hogg-Dube is different from other cystic lung diseases because the cysts tend to be at the base of the lung, under the layer of tissue that wraps the lungs and is shaped like a lentil or lens. Recent advances to understand the main functions of the folliculin protein have been made. In addition, in just the last 3 years, the impact of a folliculin gene impairment on the lungs was examined for the first time. In experiments with mice, evidence emerged that another protein called AMPK that signals to other cells and cells connecting to other cells is involved when air gets trapped in the lungs. Also, how human Birt-Hogg-Dube cysts are formed and how they progress has been recently described. The ""stretch hypothesis"" proposes that cysts in Birt-Hogg-Dube form because of defects in how cells connect to one another, leading to repeated stretching of the lungs and, over time, expansion of different parts of the lung. This idea ties together many of the new data from cell and mouse studies of Birt-Hogg-Dube and from the human studies of the disease. Critical questions remain. These questions include how the stretch-induced cyst formation are formed, if the first formation of a cyst involves a second genetic change, and whether the formation of a cyst involves just the surface of the lung or an interaction between the lung surface and cells under tissues. Overall, understanding the processes of cystic lung disease in Birt-Hogg-Dube may help to understand how it leads to sudden collapse of the lung, with more than 20,000 cases a year in the United States.",
15,27306796,"Purpose of review: Renal potassium (K) secretion plays a key role in maintaining K homeostasis. The classic mechanism of renal K secretion is focused on the connecting tubule and cortical collecting duct, in which K is uptaken by basolateral Na-K-ATPase and is secreted into the lumen by apical ROMK (Kir1.1) and Ca-activated big conductance K channel. Recently, genetic studies and animal models have indicated that inwardly rectifying K channel 4.1 (Kir4.1 or Kcnj10) in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) may play a role in the regulation of K secretion in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron by targeting the NaCl cotransporter (NCC). This review summarizes recent progresses regarding the role of Kir4.1 in the regulation of NCC and K secretion. Recent findings: Kir4.1 is expressed in the basolateral membrane of the DCT, and plays a predominant role in contributing to the basolateral K conductance and in participating in the generation of negative membrane potential. Kir4.1 is also the substrate of src-family tyrosine kinase and the stimulation of src-family tyrosine kinase activates Kir4.1 activity in the DCT. The genetic deletion or functional inhibition of Kir4.1 depolarizes the membrane of the DCT, inhibits ste20-proline-alanine rich kinase, and suppresses NCC activity. Moreover, the downregulation of Kir4.1 increases epithelial Na channel expression in the collecting duct and urinary K excretion. Finally, mice with low Kir4.1 activity in the DCT are hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia. Summary: Recent progress in exploring the regulation and the function of Kir4.1 in the DCT strongly indicates that Kir4.1plays an important role in initiating the regulation of renal K secretion by targeting NCC and it may serves as a K sensor in the kidney.","Renal (kidney-related) secretion or release plays a key role in maintaining potassium homeostasis (processes used by the body to maintain a normal potassium concentration in the fluid outside the cells). Renal release of potassium mainly takes place within the kidneys through as series of tubes and ducts. Potassium is absorbed through the potassium channel that is located at the base or sides of the cell called the basolateral and is released into a tube called the lumen through potassium channels. Recent studies have suggested that potassium channels 4.1 (Kir4.1 or Kcnj10) located within the kidney at the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) (which connects to the duct system in the kidneys and helps with salt and water reabsorption) may play a role in regulating the release of potassium by targeting the NaCl cotransporter (NCC) (the carrier protein that helps reabsorb sodium and chloride ions from tube fluid into the cells). This review summarizes recent progress on the role of the potassium channel Kir4.1 in the control of NCC and potassium secretion (release). Recent findings show that Kir4.1 is activated in the basolateral membrane (the thin layer surrounding a cell located at the base or sides of the cell) of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Kir4.1 plays a major role in helping the basolateral pass potassium through the cell and in helping cell membranes have a negative charge. Kir4.1 also activates proteins that send signals to other cells which in turn activate Kir4.1 activity in the DCT. Kir4.1 depolarizes (changes the internal charge to make the cell less negative) the membrane of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), slows down other proteins that regulate cell activity, and suppresses NaCl cotransporter activity. Additionally, the decrease in function of Kir4.1 increases activity of the epithelial Na channel (the lining of the outer part of the kidney tubule) in the ducts and potassium release through urine. Finally, mice with low Kir4.1 activity in the DCT are hypomagnesemia (have a low level of the magnesium mineral in the blood) and hypokalemia (have low levels of potassium). In summary, recent progress in exploring the control and function of Kir4.1 in the distal convoluted tubule suggests that Kir4.1 has an important role in starting the regulation of releasing potassium in the kidneys by targeting NaCl cotransporter and may be a potassium sensor in the kidney.","Kidney-related potassium (K) secretion helps maintain K balance. Kidney-related K removal commonly focuses on specific parts of sub-kidney units. In these units, K is pulled in by outer-facing protein, which transports K and sodium across a boundary, and is secreted into the inner tube by ROMK (Kir1.1), a K-specific transport protein, and calcium-activated K-specific transport channel. Recently, gene-related studies and animal models have shown that inwardly correcting potassium channel 4.1 (Kir4.1 or Kcnj10) in a specific region of sub-kidney units may monitor potassium secretion in the hormone-sensitive, outward sub-kidney unit by targeting the sodium-chloride cotransporter. This review summarizes recent improvements regarding the role of Kir4.1 channel in regulating the sodium-chloride cotransporter and potassium secretion. Kir4.1 is active in the outer-facing boundary of a specific region of the sub-kidney units and helps transport potassium outward and create a negative boundary charge. Kir4.1 is also the target of a high-energy transporting protein. This transporting protein activates Kir4.1 activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units. The gene-related deletion or silencing of Kir4.1 changes the charge of the boundary of a specific region of sub-kidney units, blocks a high-energy transporting protein, and prevents sodium-chloride channel activity. Also, reducing Kir4.1 activity increases boundary-lining sodium channel activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units and K removal via urine. Finally, mice with low Kir4.1 activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units have low blood magnesium and low blood potassium. Recent progress in exploring the monitoring and use of Kir4.1 in a specific region of sub-kidney units shows that Kir4.1 helps begin the monitoring of kidney-related K removal by targeting sodium-chloride channels. Kir4.1 may also be a K sensor in the kidney."
50,10530060,"Purpose: To evaluate the practical value of initial C-reactive protein (CRP) in the diagnosis of bacterial infection in children. Methods: The subjects comprised 11 children, six boys and five girls, aged 3 months through to 3 years (median age 16 months), whose initial CRP levels were < 1.0 mg/dL despite bacterial infection. C-reactive protein was quantitated at the first medical examination by nephelometry. Results: The diagnosis was urinary tract infection (n = 4), bacterial meningitis (n = 2), sepsis (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2) and arthritis of the hip joint (n = 1). The CRP levels were significantly elevated during the course of infection, ranging from 7.6 to 28.5 mg/dL. The bacterial etiology was non-specific. Eight patients were examined within 12 h of onset, three exhibited negative CRP values despite the duration of the insult over 12 h. Six patients were tentatively diagnosed as having a bacterial infection, but the other five were not. Each patient was treated, leading to a favorable outcome without any serious complications. Conclusions: Low levels of CRP do not rule out the possibility of bacterial infection in children. The initial value of CRP may be negative, even in patients with severe bacterial infection or even after 12 h from onset. The data suggest that pediatricians should consistently be aware of the possibility of bacterial infection even if the initial CRP test result is negative and that serial CRP measurements appear to be practical.","The aim of this paper was to determine how C-reactive protein volume in patients can help diagnose bacterial infections in children. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). The study evaluated 11 children. The group consisted of six boys and five girls that were between 3 months to 3 years of age. All of the children's' initial CRP levels were < 1.0 mg/dL despite bacterial infection. C-reactive protein was measured at the first medical examination. The eleven children were diagnosed with various illnesses. These include: 4 with urinary tract infection, 2 with bacterial meningitis (inflammation with intense headaches), 2 with sepsis (life-threatening condition when the body's response to infection damages itself), 2 with pneumonia (lung infection) and 1 with arthritis of the hip joint. CRP levels were increased during the course of infection. The cause of the bacterial infections were not specified. Eight patients were examined within 12 h of illness. Three showed negative CRP values despite the duration of the illness over 12 h. Six patients were tentatively diagnosed as having a bacterial infection. The other five were not. Each patient was treated. Treatment led to better health status without any serious complications. Low levels of CRP do not rule out the possibility of bacterial infection in children. The initial value of CRP may be negative, even in patients with severe bacterial infection or even after 12 h from onset. The data suggest that doctors of children should always be aware of the possibility of bacterial infection even if the initial CRP test result is negative (no detection) and that serial (multiple) CRP measurements appear to be practical.",

For SSRIs (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. The relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the SSRIs in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75-150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses. Interpretation: For the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.","Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide.

Some patients dropped out due to side effects. The relationship between the dose of the drug and dropouts for any reason suggests the best acceptability for using SSRIs is in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (a type of antidepressant) has an initially increasing relationship between dose amount and drug performance up to 75-150mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for another antidepressant called mirtazapine, performance increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine worked well in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results performed well in several sensitivity analyses to assess strength and uncertainty in a study.

13,26048677,"Introduction: Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is one of the extracardiac reasons of atrial fibrillation (AF), and the prevalence of AF is high in SAHS-diagnosed patients. Nocturnal hypoxemia is associated with AF, pulmonary hypertension, and nocturnal death. The rate of AF recurrence is high in untreated SAHS-diagnosed patients after cardioversion (CV). In this study, we present a patient whose SAHS was diagnosed with an apnea test performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and who did not develop recurrent AF after the administration of standard AF treatment and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP). Case presentation: A 57-year-old male hypertensive Caucasian patient who was on medical treatment for 1.5 months for non-organic AF was admitted to the ICU because of high-ventricular response AF (170 per minute), and sinus rhythm was maintained during the CV that was performed two times every second day. The results of the apnea test performed in the ICU on the same night after the second CV were as follows: apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 71 per hour, minimum peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 67%, and desaturation period (SpO2 of less than 90%) of 28 minutes. The patient was discharged with medical treatment and nocturnal BiPAP treatment. The results of the apnea test performed under BiPAP on the sixth month were as follows: AHI of 1 per hour, desaturation period of 1 minute, and minimum SpO2 of 87%. No recurrent AF developed in the patient, and his medical treatment was reduced within 6 months. After gastric bypass surgery on the 12th month, nocturnal hypoxia and AF did not re-occur. Thus, BiPAP and medical treatments were ended. Conclusions: SAHS can be diagnosed by performing an apnea test in the ICU. SAHS should be investigated in patients developing recurrent AF after CV. Recovery of nocturnal hypoxia may increase the success rate of standard AF treatment.","Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) (a sleep disorder of recurring episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep) is one of the causes of atrial fibrillation (AF) (a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots or stroke). The occurrence of AF is high in SAHS-diagnosed patients. Nocturnal hypoxemia (a temporary drop in oxygen while sleeping) is associated with AF, pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure affecting the arteries in the lungs and heart), and nocturnal death (death in sleep caused by sudden cardiac death). The frequency of AF recurring is high in people with untreated SAHS after cardioversion, a procedure used to return an irregular or very fast heartbeat to a normal rhythm. This study summarizes the case of a patient with SAHS diagnosed by an apnea test (monitoring of breathing and oxygen) and who did not develop recurring (chronic) atrial fibrillation after receiving standard treatment and the bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), a ventilator used to maintain a consistent breathing pattern (often used at night). A 57-year old male patient who was on treatment for 1.5 months for AF was admitted to the hospital because of a high, irregular heart beat. The sinus rhythm (the pattern of your heartbeat based on the sinus node of your heart which sends out electrical pulses) was steady during the cardioversion procedure. Heart and oxygen tests were performed in the hospital after the second cardioversion. The patient was sent home with medical treatment and a nocturnal BiPAP. No recurring atrial fibrillation developed in the patient, and his medical treatment was reduced within 6 months. After gastric bypass surgery on the 12th month, nocturnal hypoxia and atrial fibrillation did not re-occur. Because they did not recur, the BiPAP and medical treatments were ended. In conclusion, SAHS can be diagnosed by performing an apnea test in the hospital. SAHS should be investigated in patients developing recurring atrial fibrillation after a cardioversion procedure. Recovery of nocturnal hypoxia may increase the success of standard atrial fibrillation treatment.",
35,22256806,"BACKGROUND: Although bone mineral density (BMD) testing to screen for osteoporosis (BMD T score, −2.50 or lower) is recommended for women 65 years of age or older, there are few data to guide decisions about the interval between BMD tests. METHODS: We studied 4957 women, 67 years of age or older, with normal BMD (T score at the femoral neck and total hip, −1.00 or higher) or osteopenia (T score, −1.01 to −2.49) and with no history of hip or clinical vertebral fracture or of treatment for osteoporosis, followed prospectively for up to 15 years. The BMD testing interval was defined as the estimated time for 10% of women to make the transition to osteoporosis before having a hip or clinical vertebral fracture, with adjustment for estrogen use and clinical risk factors. Transitions from normal BMD and from three subgroups of osteopenia (mild, moderate, and advanced) were analyzed with the use of parametric cumulative incidence models. Incident hip and clinical vertebral fractures and initiation of treatment with bisphosphonates, calcitonin, or raloxifene were treated as competing risks. RESULTS: The estimated BMD testing interval was 16.8 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5 to 24.6) for women with normal BMD, 17.3 years (95% CI, 13.9 to 21.5) for women with mild osteopenia, 4.7 years (95% CI, 4.2 to 5.2) for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1.1 years (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) for women with advanced osteopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that osteoporosis would develop in less than 10% of older, post-menopausal women during rescreening intervals of approximately 15 years for women with normal bone density or mild osteopenia, 5 years for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1 year for women with advanced osteopenia.","Although bone mineral density (BMD) testing to measure how much calcium and other minerals are in bones to look for osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) is suggested for women 65 years old or older, few studies look at how long to wait between tests. We studied 4957 women, 67 years old and older, with normal BMD or weaker than normal bones who had never broken a hip or spine or received treatment for osteoporosis, followed for up to 15 years. The time between BMD testing was the estimated time for 10% of women to develop osteoporosis before breaking a hip or spine, considering estrogen (female-specific hormone) use and risk factors. We used mathematical models to look at changes from normal BMD and from mild, moderate, and advanced osteopenia. We considered hip and spine breaks and people taking drugs to strengthen bones. We found the estimated time between BMD testing was 16.8 years for women with normal BMD and 17.3, 4.7. and 1.1 years for women with mild, moderate, and advanced osteopenia, respectively. Our results suggest that less than 10% of older women who had gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) would develop osteoporosis if tested about every 15 years for women with normal BMD or mild osteopenia, 5 years for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1 year for women with advanced osteopenia.",
53,31151228,"Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a form of intermittent fasting that involves having a longer daily fasting period. Preliminary studies report that TRF improves cardiometabolic health in rodents and humans. Here, we performed the first study to determine how TRF affects gene expression, circulating hormones, and diurnal patterns in cardiometabolic risk factors in humans. Eleven overweight adults participated in a 4-day randomized crossover study where they ate between 8 am and 2 pm (early TRF (eTRF)) and between 8 am and 8 pm (control schedule). Participants underwent continuous glucose monitoring, and blood was drawn to assess cardiometabolic risk factors, hormones, and gene expression in whole blood cells. Relative to the control schedule, eTRF decreased mean 24-hour glucose levels by 4 ± 1 mg/dl (p = 0.0003) and glycemic excursions by 12 ± 3 mg/dl (p = 0.001). In the morning before breakfast, eTRF increased ketones, cholesterol, and the expression of the stress response and aging gene SIRT1 and the autophagy gene LC3A (all p < 0.04), while in the evening, it tended to increase brain-derived neurotropic factor (BNDF; p = 0.10) and also increased the expression of MTOR (p = 0.007), a major nutrient-sensing protein that regulates cell growth. eTRF also altered the diurnal patterns in cortisol and the expression of several circadian clock genes (p < 0.05). eTRF improves 24-hour glucose levels, alters lipid metabolism and circadian clock gene expression, and may also increase autophagy and have anti-aging effects in humans.","Intermittent fasting is a type of eating schedule where a person doesn't eat any calories for a period of time. Time-restricted feeding is a form of intermittent fasting that involves having a longer daily fasting period. Early studies report that time-restricted feeding improves the health of the heart and metabolism in rodents and humans. In this study, researchers perform the first study to determine how time-restricted feeding affects how information from genes are used, how circulating hormones that travel in blood and attach to cells can change the cell function, and how daily patterns in the heart and metabolism can be risk factors in humans. Eleven overweight adults participated in a 4-day study where they ate between 8 am and 2 pm (early time-restricted feeding) and between 8 am and 8 pm (control group for comparison). Participants have their sugar continuously monitored, and blood is drawn to assess risk factors to the heart and metabolism, hormones, and gene development in blood cells. Relative to the comparison group's schedule, early time-restricted feeding decreased the average 24-hour sugar levels and changes in blood sugar. In the morning before breakfast, early time-restricted feeding increased ketones (substances that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar), cholesterol, and the activity of the stress response and aging gene SIRT1 and the gene LC3A that cleans out damaged cells. While in the evening, time-restricted feeding tends to increase brain-derived neurotropic factor, which is a helpful protein in the spinal cord and brain, and also increases the expansion of the MTOR gene, a major nutrient-sensing protein that regulates cell growth. Early time-restricted feeding changes daily patterns in the cortisol stress hormone and use of several genes. Early time-restricted feeding improves 24 hour blood sugar levels, changes how fats are broken down, and how gene functions are used. Early time-restricted feeding may also increase cleaning of damaged cells and anti-aging effects in humans.",
28,34549987,"Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in patients with COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation. It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Remarkablely, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation. The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HUB1-CoV and influenza virus H1N1 did not activate endothelial cells. These findings are well consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a worldwide challenge for health-care systems. The leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19 is hypoxic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date, pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) have been largely overlooked as a therapeutic target in COVID-19, yet emerging evidence suggests that these cells contribute to the initiation and propagation of ARDS by altering vessel barrier integrity, promoting a pro-coagulative state, inducing vascular inflammation and mediating inflammatory cell infiltration. Therefore, a better mechanistic understanding of the vasculature is of utmost importance. In this study, we screened the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells and found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Our results provide insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients.","Recent scientific reports suggest that increased endothelial activation plays a key role in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure seen within patients of COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease). Endothelial cells line our organs within our body, especially blood vessels. When these cells become activated, they encourage inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) and blood clotting or scabbing. However, how COVID-19 causes this endothelial cell activation is unclear. In this study, COVID-19 virus proteins (small molecules within the virus that help it function) were analyzed. The goal of analyzing the proteins was to determine how they might activate endothelial cells. This study found a specific protein of COVID-19 that highly activated endothelial cells through two specific bodily pathways. Secondly, the authors identified a prescription medication, known as Simvastatin, that can reduce the identified endothelial activation. The authors also noted that the identified protein only caused endothelial activation in COVID-19 illness. This protein in other illnesses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HUB1-CoV and influenza virus H1N1, did not activate endothelial cells. These scientific findings match with results from clinical research (research within patients). Clinical research has shown broad endothelial cell inflammation and organ injury within COVID-19 patients. The authors concluded this paper increases current knowledge surrounding how COVID-19 impacts blood vessels and blood flow within patients. Additionally, this paper suggested simvastatin may help prevent damage and improve overall health within COVID-19 patients. COVID-19, caused by a coronavirus, is a worldwide challenge for health-care. The leading cause of death in those with COVID-19 is lack of oxygen in the blood from a breathing-related illness. To date, cells that line the lungs and its blood vessels have been overlooked as a therapy target in COVID-19, yet new evidence suggests these cells contribute to the start and spread of breathing-related illnesses by changing blood vessel structures, promoting clotting, causing inflammation, and influencing inflammatory cell reactions. Therefore, a better understanding of the blood vessels Is of great importance. In this study, we tested COVID-19 virus proteins that activate these blood-vessel lining cells and found that viral proteins activate these cells through phosphate-related pathways. Also, by testing a natural microorganism library with 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was found to be a powerful blocker of the viral-caused lining cell activation. Our results give insights on the viral-caused blood- and blood vessel-related diseases, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved fat-lowering drug, may help prevent these diseases and improve outcomes for COVID-19 patients.",
26,32150748,"Background: A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.","In December 2019, a new human coronavirus that affects the breathing or respiratory system, known as COVID-19, was identified in China. Little is known about how COVID-19 impacts human health, including how long the disease's incubation period (the time between initial exposure and the first signs of illness) lasts. Knowing the incubation period of the disease is important for preventing further spread. The goal of this paper was to estimate the length of the COVID-19 incubation period and how it impacts the public's health. To reach this goal, the authors reviewed confirmed COVID-19 cases that were reported between January 4th to February 24th in 2020. The information was gathered from news reports and press releases from over 50 locations outside of Wuhan city within the Hubei province of China. Only people with confirmed COVID-19 infection outside of the Hubei province of China were of interest for the evaluation. Patient characteristics (e.g. age, ethnicity) and specific health measurements (e.g. dates of exposure, start of symptoms) were reviewed. In total, 181 confirmed COVID-19 cases with definable exposure points and start of symptoms were evaluated for incubation period estimation. The average incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days. Overall, the majority of people will develop symptoms within 11.5 days after time of infection. These estimates imply that a portion of the population (101 out of every 10,000 COVID-19 patients) will show symptoms after 14 days of quarantine. Because only cases from new outlets and press releases were evaluated, the estimations may be based on more severe COVID-19 cases. Mild cases, which may go unreported, may have a different incubation period. Even though the data for mild COVID-19 cases may differ, this estimate provides support for an average incubation period for COVID-19 of 5 days. This estimation may help in the creation of appropriate quarantine measures for persons potentially exposed to COVID-19.",

14,32471251,"The coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) was announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Challenges arise concerning how to optimally support the immune system in the general population, especially under self-confinement. An optimal immune response depends on an adequate diet and nutrition in order to keep infection at bay. For example, sufficient protein intake is crucial for optimal antibody production. Low micronutrient status, such as of vitamin A or zinc, has been associated with increased infection risk. Frequently, poor nutrient status is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn can impact the immune system. Dietary constituents with especially high anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity include vitamin C, vitamin E, and phytochemicals such as carotenoids and polyphenols. Several of these can interact with transcription factors such as NF-kB and Nrf-2, related to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, respectively. Vitamin D in particular may perturb viral cellular infection via interacting with cell entry receptors (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), ACE2. Dietary fiber, fermented by the gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids, has also been shown to produce anti-inflammatory effects. In this review, we highlight the importance of an optimal status of relevant nutrients to effectively reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby strengthening the immune system during the COVID-19 crisis.","The coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral breathing-related disease, was announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Challenges arise on how to best support the immune system (a complex network of tissues, organs, cells, and proteins that defends the body against infection) in the general population. The best immune response depends on enough food and nutrition in order to keep infections away. For example, eating enough protein is important for producing antibodies (a protective protein used by the immune system in response to an infection). A lack of nutrients (vitamins and minerals) in the body, such as vitamin A or zinc, is associated with an increased risk of infection. Frequently, low nutrient status in the body is associated with inflammation (the body's response to injury or infection often causing swelling, pain, or redness) and oxidative stress (a condition that happens when nutrients and minerals that protect cells are low), which can impact the immune system. Foods that can help relieve inflammation and have antioxidants (vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells) have vitamin C, vitamin E, and phytochemicals (compounds found in fruits and vegetables). Several of these foods can interact with proteins in the body that are related to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Vitamin D in particular may help prevent the viral infection from entering cells. Fiber in foods has also been shown to fight inflammation.

19,32721557,"Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease, has been linked to increased central and peripheral inflammation. Although the response of the immune system to dopaminergic treatment remains to be fully understood, dopaminergic agonists are known to exhibit immunoregulatory properties which may, at least in part, explain their therapeutic effect in PD. This highlights the need of analyzing immune parameters in longitudinal studies on PD patients receiving specific therapeutic regimes. In this work, PD patients were included in a two-year prospective study comparing the effect of levodopa alone and a levodopa/pramipexole combo therapy on several regulatory and pro-inflammatory immune cell populations. We demonstrated that PD patients show decreased circulating levels of several important regulatory subpopulations, as determined by flow cytometry. Notably, when administered alone, levodopa decreased the levels of functional Bregs and SLAMF1+ tolerogenic DCs and increased the levels of total and HLA-DR+ classical monocytes, while the pramipexole/levodopa combo may promote Treg- and tolerogenic DC-mediated regulatory responses. These results suggest that a regime based on levodopa alone may promote a pro-inflammatory-type response in PD patients, but when combined with pramipexole, it promotes a clinically beneficial regulatory-type environment.","Parkinson's disease (PD) (a brain-related disease affecting movement) is the second most frequent brain-related disease and is linked to increased full-body inflammation.

52,30811826,"The pathogenesis of Turner syndrome (TS) and the genotype-phenotype relationship has been thoroughly investigated during the last decade. It has become evident that the phenotype seen in TS does not only depend on simple gene dosage as a result of X chromosome monosomy. The origin of TS specific comorbidities such as infertility, cardiac malformations, bone dysgenesis, and autoimmune diseases may depend on a complex relationship between genes as well as transcriptional and epigenetic factors affecting gene expression across the genome. Furthermore, two individuals with TS with the exact same karyotype may exhibit completely different traits, suggesting that no conventional genotype-phenotype relationship exists. Here, we review the different genetic mechanisms behind differential gene expression, and highlight potential key-genes essential to the comorbidities seen in TS and other X chromosome aneuploidy syndromes. KDM6A, important for germ cell development, has shown to be differentially expressed and methylated in Turner and Klinefelter syndrome across studies. Furthermore, TIMP1/TIMP3 genes seem to affect the prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve. KDM5 C could play a role in the neurocognitive development of Turner and Klinefelter syndrome. However, further research is needed to elucidate the genetic mechanism behind the phenotypic variability and the different phenotypic traits seen in TS.","The disease development of Turner syndrome (TS), and how gene expression effects physical appearance, has been heavily investigated over the last decade. Turner syndrome is a condition where there is an abnormal amount of chromosomes (genetic material). Phenotype (observable characteristics) seen in TS does not only depend on the number of copies of a gene as a result of X chromosome monosomy. Monosomy indicates there is an absence of one member of a chromosome pair; instead of 46 chromosomes in each cell of the body, there is 45. The origin of TS specific comorbidities (presence of two or more diseases) may depend on crosstalk between genes as well as factors affecting gene expression. These comorbidities include infertility, heart-related malformations, defective bone development, and autoimmune diseases (in which immune cells attack healthy cells). Furthermore, two people with TS with the exact same karyotype, number and visual appear of chromosomes, may exhibit completely different traits.

47,26893260,"Hypophosphatasia is the inborn error of metabolism characterized by low serum alkaline phosphatase activity (hypophosphatasaemia). This biochemical hallmark reflects loss-of-function mutations within the gene that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). TNSALP is a cell-surface homodimeric phosphohydrolase that is richly expressed in the skeleton, liver, kidney and developing teeth. In hypophosphatasia, extracellular accumulation of TNSALP natural substrates includes inorganic pyrophosphate, an inhibitor of mineralization, which explains the dento-osseous and arthritic complications featuring tooth loss, rickets or osteomalacia, and calcific arthopathies. Severely affected infants sometimes also have hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia due to the blocked entry of minerals into the skeleton, and pyridoxine-dependent seizures from insufficient extracellular hydrolysis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the major circulating form of vitamin B6, required for neurotransmitter synthesis. Autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance from ~300 predominantly missense ALPL (also known as TNSALP) mutations largely accounts for the remarkably broad-ranging expressivity of hypophosphatasia. High serum concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate represent a sensitive and specific biochemical marker for hypophosphatasia. Also, phosphoethanolamine levels are usually elevated in serum and urine, though less reliably for diagnosis. TNSALP mutation detection is important for recurrence risk assessment and prenatal diagnosis. Diagnosing paediatric hypophosphatasia is aided by pathognomic radiographic changes when the skeletal disease is severe. Hypophosphatasia was the last type of rickets or osteomalacia to await a medical treatment. Now, significant successes for severely affected paediatric patients are recognized using asfotase alfa, a bone-targeted recombinant TNSALP.","Hypophosphatasia is genetic condition that blocks metabolic pathways. It is characterized by hypophosphatasemia or low serum (blood) levels of a protein, alkaline phosphatase, that indicates bone health. This biomarker, or a measurable compound to determine health status, reflects mutations within the gene that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme (form) of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). TNSALP is an enzyme that is expressed in the skeleton, liver, kidney and developing teeth. In hypophosphatasia, accumulation of TNSALP natural substrates (substances altered by TNSALP) occurs. These substrates include inorganic pyrophosphate, an inhibitor (blocker) of mineralization. Accumulation of inorganic pyrophosphate explains the tooth loss, rickets or bone softening, and joint swelling. Severely affected infants sometimes also have hypercalcemia (high calcium levels) and hyperphosphatasemia (high alkaline phosphatase levels). This is due to the blocked entry of minerals into the skeleton and pyridoxine-dependent seizures. The seizures are cause by insufficient breakdown of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the major circulating form of vitamin B6. The different types of possible mutations of ALPL (which encodes for alkaline phosphatase) largely accounts for the wide range of severity of hypophosphatasia (a rare, genetic bone disorder). High serum concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate represent an accurate and specific biomarker for hypophosphatasia. Also, levels of phosphoethanolamine (which helps construct cell boundaries) are usually elevated in serum and urine. However, these biomarkers are less reliable for diagnosis. TNSALP mutation detection is important to determine is recurrence may occur and prenatal diagnosis. Diagnosing pediatric (child) hypophosphatasia is aided by observing disease-specific changes when the skeletal disease is severe. Hypophosphatasia was the last bone disease to receive a medical treatment. Now, significant successes for severely affected child patients are recognized using asfotase alfa, a prescription drug.",
45,34414933,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Ma Yinglong Shexiang Hemorrhoids Cream combined with pearl powder on pain and complications in patients with severe pressure ulcers. Methods: One hundred seventeen patients with severe pressure ulcers hospitalized and treated in our hospital (January 2019--December 2019) were divided into Ma Yinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Cream Group (MY Group), Pearl Powder Group (PP Group), and combination with Ma Yinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Cream and Pearl Powder Group (MP group), 39 patients in each group. There was no significant difference in the general data of patients in MY group, PP group, and MP group. By analyzing the differences in clinical efficacy, secondary effects, scar incidence, pain, and clinical indicators of patients in the MY group, PP group, and MP group, the effects of Mayinglong Shexiang Hemorrhoid Cream combined with pearl powder in the treatment of pain and complications in patients with severe pressure ulcers were explored. Results: After treatment, compared with the MY group and the PP group, the MP group had a higher clinical efficacy than the MY group and the PP group. Compared with MY group and PP group, the healing time, dressing change times, and dressing change time of MP group were better than MY group (P < .05). After treatment, the VAS score and incidence of secondary effects of the MP group was significantly lower than that of the MY group and PP group (P < .05). The incidence and area of scar formation in the MP group were lower than those in the MY group and the PP group (P < .05). Conclusion: Compared with Ma Yinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Cream or Pearl Powder, combination of Ma Yinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Cream and Pearl Powder are more effective in treating severe pressure ulcer patients, and can significantly reduce the pain in the affected area and reduce the occurrence of complications.","We aimed to study the effect of Ma Yinglong Shexiang Hemorrhoids Cream combined with pearl powder on pain and side effects in patients with serious bedsores. We divided 117 patients hospitalized with serious bedsores in our hospital (January 2019-December 2019) into the Ma Yinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Cream Group (MY Group), Pearl Powder Group (PP Group), and combination with Ma Yinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Cream and Pearl Powder Group (MP group), 39 patients in each group. Patients in the three groups generally were similar. We looked at the effects of Mayinglong Shexiang Hemorrhoid Cream combined with pearl powder in the treatment of pain and side effects in patients with serious bedsores based on differences in how well a treatment works, side effects, scar occurrence, pain, and quality of care of patients in the MY, PP, and MP groups. The MP group treatment worked better than the MY and PP groups. The MP group had better healing time and dressing change times than the MY group. The MP group had a better score on a common scoring tool for pain and fewer side effects than the MY and PP groups. The MP group had less occurrence of scars and smaller scar area than the MY and PP groups. A combination of Ma Yinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Cream and Pearl Powder worked better than either treatment by itself in treating severe bedsore patients, and can significantly reduce pain in the affected area and side effects.",
34,33439824,"Background: Approximately 10% of adults in Germany have chronic kidney disease (CKD). The prevalence of CKD among patients being cared for by general practitioners is approximately 30%, and its prevalence in nursing homes is over 50%. An S3 guideline has been developed for the management of CKD in primary care. Methods: The guideline is based on publications retrieved by a systematic search of the literature for international guidelines published in the period 2013-2017, and additional searches on specific questions. It was created by the German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Allgemeinmedizin und Familienmedizin, DEGAM) and consented with the German Societies of Nephrology and Internal Medicine (DGfN, DGIM) and patient representation. Results: Upon the initial diagnosis of CKD (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 mL/ min), the patient's blood pressure and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) should be measured, and the urine should be examined for hematuria. Monitoring intervals are determined on an individual basis depending on the stage of disease and the patient's general state of health and personal preferences. Nephrological consultation should be obtained if the GFR is less than 30 mL/min, if CKD is initially diagnosed (GFR 30-59 mL/min) in the presence of persistent hematuria without any urological explanation or of albinuria in stage A2 or higher, if the patient has refractory hypertension requiring three or more antihypertensive drugs, or if the renal disease is rapidly progressive. The threshold for referring a patient should be kept low for persons under age 50; persons over age 70 should be referred only if warranted in consideration of their comorbidities and individual health goals. Conclusion: The main elements of the treatment of CKD are the treatment of hypertension and diabetes and the modification of lifestyle factors. An innovation from the primary care practioner's perspective is the assessment of albuminuria with the albumin-to-creatinine ratio.","About 10% of adults in Germany have chronic kidney disease, which is when the kidneys are damaged and can't filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. The percentage of chronic kidney disease among patients being cared for by primary care doctors (family doctors) is about 30% and is over 50% in nursing homes. A guideline has been developed for the care of chronic kidney disease in primary (family) care offices. This guideline is based on existing, available data in articles published during 2013 - 2017 and also on additional searches of data on specific questions. It is created by the German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians and agreed with by the German Societies of Nephrology and Internal Medicine and patient representation. At the first diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, the patient's blood pressure, as well as a urine sample that may indicate a kidney complication from high proteins, should be measured. The urine should also be checked for the presence of blood. How often the patient should be monitored is based on the individual and depends on the stage of disease, the patient's overall health, and personal preferences. A doctor who specializes in kidney disease should be consulted based on tests that check how well the kidneys are working, if there is blood in the urine, if the patient's blood pressure requires 3 or more drugs, and if the kidney disease is quickly getting worse. The requirements and test levels to refer a patient under the age of 50 years for specialty care should be kept low. People over 70 should be referred only if necessary due to other illnesses and individual health goals. The main parts of treating chronic kidney disease are the treatment of high blood pressure and diabetes and changing lifestyle. A new assessment from the family doctor is a sign of kidney disease due to too much of a protein called albumin in the urine.",
29,32340216,"Public health practices including handwashing and vaccinations help reduce the spread and impact of infections. Nevertheless, the global burden of infection is high, and additional measures are necessary. Acute respiratory tract infections, for example, were responsible for approximately 2.38 million deaths worldwide in 2016. The role nutrition plays in supporting the immune system is well-established. A wealth of mechanistic and clinical data show that vitamins, including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and folate; trace elements, including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper; and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid play important and complementary roles in supporting the immune system. Inadequate intake and status of these nutrients are widespread, leading to a decrease in resistance to infections and as a consequence an increase in disease burden. Against this background the following conclusions are made: (1) supplementation with the above micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids is a safe, effective, and low-cost strategy to help support optimal immune function; (2) supplementation above the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), but within recommended upper safety limits, for specific nutrients such as vitamins C and D is warranted; and (3) public health officials are encouraged to include nutritional strategies in their recommendations to improve public health.","Public health practices, including handwashing and vaccinations, help reduce the spread and impact of infections. However, the global impact of infection is high, and additional measures are necessary. Sudden infections in the lung, also called acute respiratory tract or breathing-related infections, for example, were responsible for about 2.38 million deaths worldwide in 2016. The role nutrition plays in supporting the immune or infection-fighting system is well-documented. A lot of data from existing studies show that vitamins and natural acids play important roles in supporting the immune system. These include vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and folate; trace elements, including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper; and the omega-3 fatty acids and other acids. Not eating or maintaining enough of these nutrients is common, leading to a decrease in the body's ability to resist infections which may result in higher illness, loss, and death because of disease. Based on this available information, the following conclusions are made: 1) using supplements to add vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids is a safe, effective, and inexpensive way to help support immune system functions; 2) supplements above the recommended amount, but still within safety limits, for certain nutrients may be allowed; and 3) public health officials are encouraged to include nutrition plans in their recommendations to improve public health.",
18,9540949,"Objective: To determine the effect of carbohydrate restriction on perinatal outcome in patients with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: Women with diet-controlled GDM were divided non-randomly into two groups based on their dietary carbohydrate content: those with low dietary carbohydrate content (below 42%) and those with high dietary carbohydrate content (exceeding 45%). Subjects kept dietary accounts and were followed with daily fasting and postprandial glucose assessments. Subjects also were tested daily for urinary ketones. Glycosylated hemoglobin, mean fasting and postprandial glucose values, incidence of macrosomia and large for gestational age (LGA) infants, cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia, and need for insulin therapy were compared between the groups. Results: The two groups were identical in terms of demographic characteristics. Significant reductions in the postprandial glucose values were seen among subjects in the low-carbohydrate group (P < .04). Fewer subjects in the low-carbohydrate group required the addition of insulin for glucose control (P < .047; relative risk [RR] 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02, 1.00). The incidence of LGA infants was significantly lower in the low-carbohydrate group (P < .035; RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.05, 0.91). Subjects in the low carbohydrate group also had a lower rate of cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia (P < .037; RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.04, 0.94). Conclusion: Carbohydrate restriction in patients with diet-controlled GDM results in improved glycemic control, less need for insulin therapy, a decrease in the incidence LGA infants, and a decrease in cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia.","The objective is to determine how carb restriction affects births in diet-controlled gestational diabetics, in which high blood sugar affects pregnant women. Diet-controlled, pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar were divided non-randomly based on dietary carb intake: a low-carb intake group (below 42%) or high-carb intake group (over 45%). Subjects kept diet records and were followed with daily blood sugar measurements. Subjects also were tested daily for ketones in urine. Certain blood sugar and birth-related measurements were compared between groups. The two groups had identical socioeconomic traits. The low-carb group had reduced after-meal glucose levels. Less patients in the low-carb group needed insulin for glucose control. The frequency of large-for-prebirth-age infants was lower in the low-carb group. The low-carb group also had less cesarean deliveries for large-head babies and large-body babies. Carb restriction in diet-controlled, pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar improves blood sugar control, reduces need for insulin, reduces frequency of large-for-prebirth-age infants, and reduces cesarean deliveries for large-head and large-body babies.","The objective of this study is to determine the effect of limiting carbohydrates (carbs) on perinatal (time before and after birth) outcomes in patients with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus (diagnosed with diabetes for the first time during pregnancy). Women with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus are divided non-randomly into two groups based on the amount of carbs in their diet: those with low carbs in the diet (below 42%) and those with high carbs in the diet (exceeding 45%). Patients keep food diaries and are followed with assessments of daily fasting (no food) and blood sugar levels after meals. Patients also were tested daily for urinary ketones (chemicals in uring made from the liver that indicate the body is using fat for fuel instead of sugar). Glycosylated hemoglobin (a blood test that measures the percent of a protein found in blood red cells), average fasting and after meals blood sugar numbers, number of macrosomia (a newborn who is much larger than average) and large for gestational age infants (newborns who weighs more than 90% of other newborns of the same gestational age at birth), cesarean deliveries (C-section) for cephalopelvic disproportion (when a baby's head is too large to fit through the mother's pelvis) and macrosomia, and need for insulin therapy (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood) are compared between the groups. The two groups are identical in terms of demographic characteristics such as age, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and income. Major decreases in the after meal blood sugar numbers are seen among patients in the low-carb group. Fewer patients in the low-carb group needed the additional insulin to control blood sugar. The number of large for gestational age infants was much lower in the low-carb group. Patients in the low-carb group also have lower rates of cesarean deliveries due to cephalopelvic disproportion (in which the baby's head is too large to fit through the mother's pelvis) and macrosomia (in which the newborn who is much larger than average). In conclusion, limiting carbohydrates in patients with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus results in improved blood sugar control, less need for insulin therapy, a decrease in the number of large for gestational age infants, and a decrease in cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia."
23,17443661,"""Inborn errors of metabolism,"" first recognized 100 years ago by Garrod, were seen as transforming evidence for chemical and biological individuality. Phenylketonuria (PKU), a Mendelian autosomal recessive phenotype, was identified in 1934 by Asbjörn Fölling. It is a disease with impaired postnatal cognitive development resulting from a neurotoxic effect of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). Its metabolic phenotype is accountable to multifactorial origins both in nurture, where the normal nutritional experience introduces L-phenylalanine, and in nature, where mutations (>500 alleles) occur in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH) on chromosome 12q23.2 encoding the L-phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme (EC 1.14.16.1). The PAH enzyme converts phenylalanine to tyrosine in the presence of molecular oxygen and catalytic amounts of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), its nonprotein cofactor. PKU is among the first of the human genetic diseases to enter, through newborn screening, the domain of public health, and to show a treatment effect. This effect caused a paradigm shift in attitudes about genetic disease. The PKU story contains many messages, including: a framework on which to appreciate the complexity of PKU in which phenotype reflects both locus-specific and genomic components; what the human PAH gene tells us about human population genetics and evolution of modern humans; and how our interest in PKU is served by a locus-specific mutation database (http://www.pahdb.mcgill.ca; last accessed 20 March 2007). The individual Mendelian PKU phenotype has no ""simple"" or single explanation; every patient has her/his own complex PKU phenotype and will be treated accordingly. Knowledge about PKU reveals genomic components of both disease and health.","""Inborn errors of metabolism,"" first identified 100 years ago by Garrod, are metabolic errors from birth and important evidence for chemical and biological individuality. Asbjörn Fölling identified phenylketonuria (PKU), an inherited physical disorder, in 1934. PKU impairs cognitive development due to toxic buildup of a specific molecule, phenylalanine. The metabolic characteristics of PKU occur due to nurture, in which a normal diet includes the molecule L-phenylalanine, and nature, where DNA mutations influence the gene that creates the L-phenylalanine breakdown enzyme. The phenylalanine breakdown enzyme converts PKU into another molecule, tyrosine, using oxygen and non-protein helpers. PKU is among the first genetic diseases to enter, via newborn testing, publich health and demonstrate the use of successful treatment. This success of treatment has shifted attitudes about genetic diseases. PKU shows how DNA and genes affect physical traits, how modern humans have evolved, and how genetic databases now exist to document genetic mutations. Every individual has unique, physical characteristics involving PKU that require unique treatment. PKU shows the genetic components of disease and health.","""Inborn errors of metabolism,"" or inherited disorders in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy, first seen by a doctor 100 years ago, were important support for the idea that people have different chemical and biological makeups. Phenylketonuria (PKU), a disorder inherited from both parents, was discovered in 1934 by a doctor. It causes intellectual disability from damage to the brain caused by too much phenylalanine in the blood. Observable PKU symptoms vary due to nurture, where normal foods contain L-phenylalanine, and in nature, where many changes happen in the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) that controls the L-phenylalanine hydroxylase protein, which helps convert phenylalanine into energy. The PAH protein converts phenylalanine, one molecule, to tyrosine, another molecule. Through checks for conditions that affect newborns, PKU is one of the first inherited diseases to be prevented in the community with successful treatments. Successful treatments caused a change in thinking about inherited disease. The history of PKU provides a lot of information including a way to grasp how complicated the disease is and where observable symptoms depend on both gene location and makeup; what the human PAH gene tells us about the genetics and evolution of humans; and how our understanding of PKU is helped by a database on where gene changes happen. Observable PKU symptoms have no ""simple"" or single explanation; every patient is different and will be treated at an individual level. PKU knowledge shows that genes play a role in both disease and health."

18,17596470,"Nutrient intake plays a significant role in the health outcomes of all pregnant women. In a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), excellent glucose control is as foundational as appropriate weight gain and adequate nutrient intake. The controversies in GDM management include the following: how far to manipulate energy intake, dietary composition (carbohydrates and fats), and gestational weight gain. Signs that food restrictions have gone too far include weight loss or lack of weight gain, undereating to avoid insulin therapy, positive urinary ketones, and intentional restriction of healthy foods. If a balance between nutrient needs and glucose control cannot be achieved, then concurrent medication therapy is needed to assist in reducing insulin resistance and supplementing insulin production to provide normoglycemia and improved pregnancy outcomes. Medical nutrition therapy is a self-management therapy. Education, support, and follow-up are required to assist the woman to make lifestyle changes essential to successful nutrition therapy. Women with GDM are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes; learning to manage GDM with lifestyle change provides an opportunity to affect personal risk factors and the health of the whole family.","Eating nutrients (foods or substances that allow the body to grow and develop) plays a major role in the health outcomes of all pregnant women. In a pregnancy that is complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (a type of diabetes first seen during pregnancy in a woman who did not have diabetes before pregnancy), excellent blood sugar control is as important as healthy weight gain and getting enough nutrients. The disagreement in the care of gestational diabetes mellitus includes the following: how far to change food consumption, how much carbohydrates and fats make up the diet, and how much weight the infant gains during the pregnancy. Signs that limiting food have gone too far include weight loss or lack of weight gain, undereating to avoid insulin (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood) therapy to keep blood sugar normal, positive ketones in urine that indicate the body is using fat for fuel instead of sugar, and planned limits of healthy foods.

16,1078546,"The mechanisms and kinetics of the immunosuppressive effects of alternate-day prednisone were investigated in a group of patients with a variety of inflammatory diseases receiving a range of alternate-day prednisone doses from 5 to 120 mg. Total circulating lymphocyte and monocyte counts, as well as proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations defined both by surface markers and by in vitro functional capacities, were studied. At 8 a. m. of the day on prednisone, just before drug administration, lymphocyte and monocyte counts, proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations, as well as in vitro lymphocyte blastogenic responses to various mitogenic and antigenic stimuli were normal. 4 h after the administration of prednisone, there was a profound lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia, with a differential depletion of thymus-derived lymphocytes as well as various functionally defined lymphocyte subpopulations. Lymphocyte kinetic studies using a radioactive chromium-labeled autologous lymphocytes showed that the lymphocytopenia was due predominantly to a transient depletion of the recirculating portion of the intravascular lymphocytepool. All these parameters returned to normal by 8 a.m. of the following day (off prednisone) and remained normal throughout the day. This very transient lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia after prednisone, with normal cell numbers, proportions, and functions throughout the remainder of the 2-day cycle, was associated with suppression of disease activity, yet did not affect cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity in these patients nor increase the likelihood of infectious complications. This drug-associated cyclic and transient monocytopenia and selective lymphocytopenia is best explained by a redistribution of recirculating lymphocytes to other body compartments, particularly the bone marrow.","The process and reactions of the immune system from taking alternate- or every-other-day prednisone (a type of steroid drug that works by lowering the activity of the immune system) are investigated in a group of patients with different inflammatory diseases (diseases in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues). Total circulating lymphocyte (the total number of white blood cells in body fluids) and number of monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria that enter the body), as well as lymphocyte subpopulations (parts of lymphocytes or white blood cells), were studied. At 8 a.m. of the day of receiving prednisone, just before the drug was given to patients, blood tests that include lymphocyte and monocyte counts and proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations were found to be normal. Four hours after receiving the prednisone, there is major lymphocytopenia (a condition where there is a lower-than-normal number of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, in the blood), monocytopenia (a reduction of monocytes, a type of immune cell, in the blood), reduction of T-cells (a type of immune cell that help protect the body from infection), and the presence of different lymphocyte subpopulations. Studies that focus on lymphocyte reactions showed that lymphocytopenia is due to short-term reduction of white blood cells circulating within and outside cells. All these blood measures returned to normal by 8 a.m. the next day (off the prednisone) and stayed normal throughout the day. The very short-term lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia after prednisone, with normal cell numbers and counts for the rest of the 2-day cycle, are connected with eliminating disease activity, yet did not affect cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity (showing a reaction in the skin after several days) and did not increase the chance of complications with infection. The short-term monocytopenia and lymphocytopenia connected with this drug is best explained as the body redistributing lymphocytes (white blood cells that are part of the immune system) to other parts of the body, particularly the bone marrow.",
36,33991399,"The primary goals of medical expulsive therapy are to increase the rate of stone expulsion along the ureter to avoid ureteral obstruction and reduce ureteral colic and thus avoid the need for surgical and more invasive interventions. This review focussed on the findings from in vivo and in vitro animal and human studies that have investigated the pharmacological mechanisms controlling ureteral motility and their translation to current and potentially new clinically used drugs for increasing the rate of stone expulsion along the ureter. The complicated contractility profile of the ureter, which alters with age, tissue segment region, orientation and species contributes to the difficulty of interpreting studies on ureteral pharmacology, which translates to the complexity of discovering ideal drug targets for medical expulsive therapy. Nevertheless, the current drug classes clinically used for patients with stone lodgement include α1 -adrenoceptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers and NSAIDS, whilst there are promising targets for drug development that require further clinical investigations including the phosphodiesterase type 5 enzyme, β-adrenoceptors and 5-HT receptors.","Medical expulsive therapy uses medication to relax certain muscles in the body to release small kidney stones.

This review focuses on the findings from animal and human studies that investigate the ways drugs work in the ureter and how drugs may potentially help release stones from the body. How the ureter tube, that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder, is able to contract changes over time and makes interpreting results from studies on drugs difficult and, therefore, hard to find the best drugs for medical explusive therapy.

32,23608654,"Intervention with riboflavin was recently shown to produce genotype-specific lowering of blood pressure (BP) in patients with premature cardiovascular disease homozygous for the 677C→ T polymorphism (TT genotype) in the gene encoding the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Whether this effect is confined to patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease is unknown. The aim of this randomized trial, therefore, was to investigate the responsiveness of BP to riboflavin supplementation in hypertensive individuals with the TT genotype but without overt cardiovascular disease. From an available sample of 1427 patients with hypertension, we identified 157 with the MTHFR 677TT genotype, 91 of whom agreed to participate in the trial. Participants were stratified by systolic BP and randomized to receive placebo or riboflavin (1.6 mg/d) for 16 weeks. At baseline, despite being prescribed multiple classes of antihypertensive drugs, >60% of participants with this genotype had failed to reach goal BP (≤140/90 mm Hg). A significant improvement in the biomarker status of riboflavin was observed in response to intervention (P<0.001). Correspondingly, an overall treatment effect of 5.6±2.6 mm Hg (P=0.033) in systolic BP was observed, with pre- and postintervention values of 141.8±2.9 and 137.1±3.0 mm Hg (treatment group) and 143.5±3.0 and 144.3±3.1 mm Hg (placebo group), whereas the treatment effect in diastolic BP was not significant (P=0.291). In conclusion, these results show that riboflavin supplementation targeted at hypertensive individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype can decrease BP more effectively than treatment with current antihypertensive drugs only and indicate the potential for a personalized approach to the management of hypertension in this genetically at-risk group.","Use of riboflavin (a B vitamin) was recently shown to have genotype-specific effects on lowering blood pressure (BP). This means a person's response was different depending on their genetic makeup. This process was shown within patients of premature (or early) cardiovascular (or heart-related) disease with a TT genotype of a specific genetic variation or gene change. This genetic variation, known as 677C, is found within the gene that encodes the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). MTHFR is involved in the processing of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. It is unknown if this effect is confined to patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the responsiveness of BP in hypertensive (high blood pressure) patients taking riboflavin. Specifically, these patients would have the TT genotype but no obvious cardiovascular disease. Of 1427 hypertensive patients, the authors identified 157 with the MTHFR 677TT genotype. Ninety-one agreed to participate in the study. Participants were ordered by systolic BP (when the heart contracts and the higher blood pressure number) and randomized to receive a placebo (harmless pill) or riboflavin (1.6 mg/d) for 16 weeks. Before treatment, despite being prescribed multiple classes of antihypertensive drugs, the majority of participants with this genotype had failed to reach the goal BP. A significant improvement in the level of bodily riboflavin was observed in response to intervention or treatment. A significant treatment effect in systolic BP was observed. However, no significant treatment was found in diastolic (when the heart relaxes and the lower blood pressure number) BP. The study concluded riboflavin supplementation within hypertensive individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype decreases BP more efficiently than current antihypertensive drugs only. Furthermore, this study indicates the potential for a personalized, or individualized, approach to the way high blood pressure is managed in this genetically at-risk group.",
25,34547765,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated clinical benefit in cases of mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection, substantially reducing the risk for hospitalization and severe disease 1-4. Treatment generally requires the administration of high doses of these mAbs with limited efficacy in preventing disease complications or mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients 5. Here we report the development and evaluation of Fc-optimized anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs with superior potency to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease. In several animal models of COVID-19 disease we demonstrate that selective engagement of activating FcγRs results in improved efficacy in both preventing and treating disease-induced weight loss and mortality, significantly reducing the dose required to confer full protection upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge and treatment of pre-infected animals. Our results highlight the importance of FcγR pathways in driving antibody-mediated antiviral immunity, while excluding any pathogenic or disease-enhancing effects of FcγR engagement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies upon infection. These findings have important implications for the development of Fc-engineered mAbs with optimal Fc effector function and improved clinical efficacy against COVID-19 disease.","Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that can make the coronavirus ineffective and have shown to be beneficial in cases of mild to moderate coronavirus infection, substantially reducing the risk for staying in the hospital and having severe symptoms of the disease. The coronavirus can cause COVID-19, the viral breathing-related infection. Treatment usually requires high doses of these monoclonal antibodies with limited ability in preventing complications or death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. This study reports on the development and evaluation of monoclonal antibodies enhanced with the Fc (the part of the antibody that helps interactions with other cells) to prevent or treat COVID-19. In several animal studies of COVID-19, researchers show that activating certain parts of the Fc proteins results in improvements in both preventing and treating weight loss and death from the disease. This helps reduce the dose required to gain full protection in animals who are not infected with the coronavirus. Results highlight the importance of the Fc proteins in increasing immunity to the virus. These findings may influence the development of Fc monoclonal antibodies with improved functions to help strengthen immunity against COVID-19.",
45,34408570,"Introduction: Treatment of decubitus ulcers is a grave medical problem. In many cases, it is difficult to cure a pressure ulcer, especially when it is deep and extensive, and prognosis is usually unfavourable. Treatment of decubitus ulcers requires new specialist dressings, which play an important role in the healing process. Aim: To evaluate therapeutic efficacy of active specialist medical dressings in the treatment of decubitus. Material and methods: Research involved 40 patients - 18 (45%) women and 22 (55%) men, suffering from decubitus ulcers of different size and depth, localized in the sacral region, lasting from 1.5 to 30 months. Patients were randomly assigned to two research groups (20 people each), were treated for 4 weeks with 2 different specialist dressings. ATRAUMAN Ag, which contains silver ions, was used in the first group, while paraffin gauze of BACTIGRAS type was used in the second group. An assessment of pressure ulcers' healing progress was done with a planimetric method, which evaluates the wound surface area. Results: The analysis results showed a significant statistical decrease in an average decubitus ulcer surface area in both research groups: in the first group by 60.2% (p = 0.001), and in the second group by 32.95% (p < 0.001), which speaks in favour of dressings with silver ions as having better therapeutic effectiveness. Conclusions: Using specialist dressings results in a significant decrease in the decubitus ulcer surface area, depending on the type of dressing and active substances contained within, while silver ions support curative effectiveness of the dressing used.","Treatment of bedsores is a serious medical problem. Often, a bedsore is hard to cure, especially when it is deep and covers a large area, and usually has a poor prognosis (plan for recovery). Treating bedsores requires specialized dressings, which play an important role in the healing process. We aim to rate how well active specialized dressings, which promote healing by keeping the wound moist, work to treat bedsores. We looked at 40 patients, 18 (45%) women and 22 (55%) men, with bedsores differing in size and depth, located near the bottom of the spine, lasting from 1.5 to 3.0 months. We randomly assigned patients to two groups of 20 people each and treated them with two different specialist dressings for 4 weeks. We used ATRAUMAN ag, which contains silver ions, in the first group and paraffin (waxy) gauze of BACTIGRAS type in the second group. We measured the progress of bedsore healing by measuring the wound's boundaries, which calculates the surface area. Results showed average bedsore surface area significantly decreased in the first group by 60.2% and in the second group by 32.95%, suggesting dressings with silver ions worked better. We conclude that specialist dressings significantly decrease bedsore surface area, and dressings with silver ions work better than those without.","Treating decubitus ulcers (bedsores) is a serious medical problem.

14,32780893,"COVID-19 may cause pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular alterations, and multiple organ failure, which have been ascribed to a cytokine storm, a systemic inflammatory response, and an attack by the immune system. Moreover, an oxidative stress imbalance has been demonstrated to occur in COVID-19 patients. N- Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a precursor of reduced glutathione (GSH). Due to its tolerability, this pleiotropic drug has been proposed not only as a mucolytic agent, but also as a preventive/therapeutic agent in a variety of disorders involving GSH depletion and oxidative stress. At very high doses, NAC is also used as an antidote against paracetamol intoxication. Thiols block the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 thereby hampering penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into cells. Based on a broad range of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, which are herein reviewed, the oral administration of NAC is likely to attenuate the risk of developing COVID-19, as it was previously demonstrated for influenza and influenza-like illnesses. Moreover, high-dose intravenous NAC may be expected to play an adjuvant role in the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases and in the control of its lethal complications, also including pulmonary and cardiovascular adverse events.","COVID-19 (a viral breathing-related disorder) may cause diseases such as pneumonia (lung infection), heart-related changes, and multiple organ failure, which has been related to cytokine storm (an immune reaction where the body releases too many cytokines, which play a role in the body's normal immune response, into the blood too quickly), a systematic inflammatory response (the body's natural reaction against injury and infection in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues), and an attack by the immune system. Also, an oxidative stress imbalance, which can lead to cell and tissue damage, has been shown to occur in COVID-19 patients. N- Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is used to build antioxidants (vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells), and its presence may be followed by reduced, or charged, glutathione (GSH), a key antioxidant that protects tissues and cells. NAC may be a potential preventive drug for a variety of disorders that involve GSH depletion and oxidative stress. At very high doses, N- Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is also used as a medicine against paracetamol intoxication (too much of a common oral medication called Acetaminophen used for pain and reducing fevers). NAC may help prevent SARS-CoV-2, the virus leading to COVID-19, from entering cells. NAC taken orally (by mouth) is likely to weaken the risk of developing COVID-19. Also, high-does N- Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) taken intravenously (medication delivered through the vein) may play a role in expanding the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases and help control lung and heart complications.",
15,31082167,"Potassium is mainly an intracellular ion. The sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase pump has the primary responsibility for regulating the homeostasis between sodium and potassium, which pumps out sodium in exchange for potassium, which moves into the cells. In the kidneys, the filtration of potassium takes place at the glomerulus. The reabsorption of potassium takes place at the proximal convoluted tubule and thick ascending loop of Henle. Potassium secretion occurs at the distal convoluted tubule. Aldosterone increases potassium secretion. Potassium channels and potassium-chloride cotransporters at the apical membrane also secrete potassium. Potassium disorders are related to cardiac arrhythmias. Hypokalemia occurs when serum potassium levels under 3.6 mmol/L—weakness, fatigue, and muscle twitching present in hypokalemia.","Potassium is mainly an ion (an atom or molecule that carries an electrical charge) within a body of water within cells. A protein pump in cells called the sodium-potassium pump regulates and moves sodium and potassium in and out of cells. In the kidneys, the filtering and moving of potassium takes place at the glomerulus, a cluster of tiny blood cells. Potassium is reabsorbed at the proximal convoluted tubule (in a filtering unit called the nephron that is part of the kidneys) and the thick ascending loop of Henle (a part of the nephron in the kidneys). Potassium is released at the distal convoluted tubule (a portion of the kidney nephron that functions in both absorption and secretion or release). A hormone called aldosterone increases the release of potassium. Potassium is also released through protein channels that allow potassium molecules to pass through the cells and cell boundaries. Potassium disorders are related to cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart beats). Hypokalemia occurs when there are low potassium levels in the blood and results in weakness, fatigue, and muscle twitching.",
39,34600555,"Background: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years for their potential application as disease biomarkers due to their high abundance and stability. In this study, we attempted to screen circRNAs that can be used to predict postoperative recurrence and survival in patients with gastric cancer (GC). Methods: High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in GC patients with different prognoses. The expression level of circRNAs in the training set (n = 136) and validation set (n = 167) was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Kaplan-Meier estimator, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and cox regression analysis were used to evaluate the prognostic value of circRNAs on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in GC patients. CeRNA network prediction, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed for the circRNAs with prognostic significance. Results: A total of 259 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in GC patients with different RFS. We found two circRNAs (hsa_circ_0005092 and hsa_circ_0002647) that highly expressed in GC patients with good prognoses, and subsequently established a predictive model for postoperative recurrence and prognosis evaluation, named circPanel. Patients with circPanellow might have shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). We also performed circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network prediction and functional analysis for hsa_circ_0005092 and hsa_circ_0002647. Conclusions: CircPanel has the potential to be a prognostic biomarker in GC patients with greater accuracy than a single circRNA and certain traditional tumor markers (e.g., CEA, CA19-9 and CA724).","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a special class of RNAs that do not transcribe into (result into) proteins. CircRNAs have attracted increasing attention in recent years for their potential application as disease biomarkers due to their high abundance and stability. Biomarkers are measurable, biological substances that can indicate disease in a patient. The authors aimed to screen circRNAs that can be used to predict post-operation recurrence and survival in patients with gastric cancer (GC), cancer of the stomach. Tests were used to identify differentially (uniquely) expressed circRNAs in GC patients with different prognoses or forecasts of the disease. The expression level of circRNAs in the training and validation sets were detected by laboratory testing. Training and validation sets are used in scientific modeling to train the artificial intelligence machine and then validate its output, respectively. Several statistical tests were used to predict the amount of circRNAs on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in GC patients. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) refers to the time between the day of diagnosis of a disease and the day the patient relapses into illness. Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the day of disease diagnosis that the patients are still alive. Several bioinformatics tests evaluating disease recurrence and gene expression were performed for the circRNAs with prognostic significance (estimating the future disease course). A total of 259 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in GC patients with different RFS. Two circRNAs were highly expressed in GC patients with good prognoses. These results established a predictive model for postoperative recurrence (disease relapse) and prognosis evaluation (likely course of disease), named circPanel. Patients with circPanellow might have shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Additional tests to predict a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network were completed on the two identified highly expressed circRNA. CircPanel has the potential to be a prognostic biomarker in GC patients.

The US Food and Drug Administration, (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for treatment with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Many people have a history of a significant allergic reaction to a specific food, medicine, or vaccine; hence, people all over the world have great concerns about these two authorized vaccines. This article compares the pharmacology, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Materials and methods: The required documents and information were collected from the relevant databases, including Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), PubMed, EMBASE, World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Drug Authorities (FDA) USA, Local Ministries, Health Institutes, and Google Scholar. The key terms used were: Coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines, Pfizer/BioN Tech vaccine, Moderna vaccine, pharmacology, benefits, allergic responses, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects. The descriptive information was recorded, and we eventually included 12 documents including research articles, clinical trials, and websites to record the required information. Results: Based on the currently available literature, both vaccines are beneficial to provide immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pfizer/BioN Tech Vaccine has been recommended to people 16 years of age and older, with a dose of 30 μg (0.3 m) at a cost of $19.50.

41,34486178,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited renal disorder that results from mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2, encoding polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively. Downregulation or overexpression of PKD1 or PKD2 in mouse models results in renal cyst formation, suggesting that the quantity of PC1 and PC2 needs to be maintained within a tight functional window to prevent cystogenesis. Here we show that enhanced PC2 expression is a common feature of PKD1 mutant tissues, in part due to an increase in Pkd2 mRNA. However, our data also suggest that more effective protein folding contributes to the augmented levels of PC2. We demonstrate that the unfolded protein response is activated in Pkd1 knockout kidneys and in Pkd1 mutant cells and that this is coupled with increased levels of GRP94, an endoplasmic reticulum protein that is a member of the HSP90 family of chaperones. GRP94 was found to physically interact with PC2 and depletion or chemical inhibition of GRP94 led to a decrease in PC2, suggesting that GRP94 serves as its chaperone. Moreover, GRP94 is acetylated and binds to histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a known deacetylase and activator of HSP90 proteins. Inhibition of HDAC6 decreased PC2 suggesting that HDAC6 and GRP94 work together to regulate PC2 levels. Lastly, we showed that inhibition of GRP94 prevents cAMP-induced cyst formation in vitro. Taken together our data uncovered a novel HDAC6-GRP94-related axis that likely participates in maintaining elevated PC2 levels in Pkd1 mutant cells.","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited kidney disorder that causes many cysts (growths) and is caused by changes in either the PKD1 or PKD2 genes. These genes are used to make the proteins polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), which regulate cells growth, cell movement, and interaction with other cells. In experiments with mice, when the PKD1 or PKD2 genes are less sensitive to other cells or make too many proteins, it may lead to cysts forming in the kidneys. This suggests that the number of PC1 and PC2 proteins needs to be stable within a brief time period to prevent the formation of cysts. In this study, researchers show that more cells and proteins from PC2 is a common feature of PKD1 changes, in part because of an increase in PKD2. However, this data also suggests that more effective protein folding, which is when a protein changes from a long chain to a functional shape, contributes to more levels of PC2 proteins. Researchers show that the unfolded protein response is active in the kidneys without Pkd1 and in Pkd1 mutant (changed) cells. This effect is in addition to increases in the number of an endoplasmic reticulum protein, called GRP94. The endoplasmic reticulum helps create and package proteins in cells. GRP94 is found to physically interact with PC2, and reducing or slowing GRP94 can lead to a decrease in PC2, suggesting that GRP94 serves as its chaperone (plays a part in the folding of itself as a protein). Also, GRP94 is acetylated (modified structurally) and attaches to histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), an enzyme that can control several important proteins and activate other proteins. Slowing or stopping HDAC6 decreases PC2 proteins, suggesting that HDAC6 and GRP94 work together to regulate PC2 levels. Lastly, researchers show that the slowing of GRP94 prevents the formation of cysts in laboratory tests. Together, these data uncover a new HDAC6-GRP94-related point that likely participates in maintaining higher PC2 levels in Pkd1 mutant cells.",

50,21561990,"Fever after cardiac surgery in children may be due to bacterial infection or noninfectious origin like systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) secondary to bypass procedure. A marker to distinguish bacterial from nonbacterial fever in these conditions is clinically important. The purpose of our study was to evaluate, in the early postcardiac surgery period, whether serial measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) and its change over time (CRP velocity) can assist in detecting bacterial infection. A series of consecutive children who underwent cardiac surgery with bypass were tested for serum levels of CRP at several points up to 5 days postoperatively and during febrile episodes (>38.0°C). Findings were compared among febrile patients with proven bacterial infection (FWI group; sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, deep wound infection), febrile patients without bacterial infection (FNI group), and patients without fever (NF group). In all, 121 children were enrolled in the study, 31 in the FWI group, 42 in the FNI group, and 48 patients in the NF group. Ages ranged from 4 days to 17.8 years (median 19.0, mean 46 ± 56 months). There was no significant difference among the groups in mean CRP level before surgery, 1 hour, and 18 hours after. A highly significant interaction was found in the change in CRP over time by FWI group compared with FNI group (P < .001). Mean CRP velocity ([fCRP - 18hCRP]/[fever time (days) - 0.75 day]) was significantly higher in the infectious group (4.0 ± 4.2 mg/dL per d) than in the fever-only group (0.60 ± 1.6 mg/dL per d; P < .001). A CRP velocity of 4 mg/dL per d had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 85.7% for bacterial infection with 95.2% specificity. Serial measurements of CRP/CRP velocity after cardiac surgery in children may assist clinicians in differentiating postoperative fever due to bacterial infection from fever due to noninfectious origin.","Fever after heart surgery in children may be due to bacterial infection. The fever may also be caused by a noninfectious origin like systemic (full-body) inflammatory (infection-fighting) response syndrome (SIRS). A marker to distinguish bacterial from nonbacterial fever in these conditions is important. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in the period after heart surgery, whether measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) and its change over time (CRP velocity) can help detect bacterial infection. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). Children who underwent heart surgery with bypass (diverted blood flow) were tested for serum (blood) levels of CRP at several points up to 5 days after surgery and/or when they had a fever. Evidence was compared among three patient groups. The groups include: patients with fever with proven bacterial infection (FWI group), febrile (near-fever) patients without bacterial infection (FNI group), and patients without fever (NF group). In all, 121 children were enrolled in the study, 31 in the FWI group, 42 in the FNI group, and 48 patients in the NF group. Ages ranged from 4 days to 17.8 years. There was no significant difference among the groups in mean CRP level before surgery, 1 hour, and 18 hours after. A highly significant interaction was found in the change in CRP over time by the FWI group compared with the FNI group. Mean CRP velocity was significantly higher in the infectious group than in the fever-only group. Specific CRP velocity could positively predict bacterial infection with 95.2% specificity (accuracy). Serial (consistent) measurements of CRP/CRP velocity after heart surgery in children may assist clinicians in differentiating (identifying) post-operation fever due to bacterial infection from fever due to noninfectious origin.",
24,19635161,"Background: Several medications commonly used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been designated ""potentially inappropriate"" for use in patients aged > or =65 years because their risks may outweigh their potential benefits. The actual extent of use of these agents in clinical practice is unknown, however. Methods: Using a database with information from encounters with general practitioners (GP) in Germany, we identified all patients, aged > or =65 years, with any GP office visits or dispensed prescriptions with a diagnosis of GAD (ICD-10 diagnosis code F41.1) between 10/1/2003 and 9/30/2004 (""GAD patients""). Among GAD-related medications (including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, hydroxyzine, buspirone, pregabalin, and trifluoperazine), long-acting benzodiazepines, selected short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high dosages, selected TCAs, and hydroxyzine were designated ""potentially inappropriate"" for use in patients aged > or = 65 years, based on published criteria. Results: A total of 975 elderly patients with GAD were identified. Mean age was 75 years, and 72% were women; 29% had diagnoses of comorbid depression. Forty percent of study subjects received potentially inappropriate agents - most commonly, bromazepam (10% of all subjects), diazepam (9%), doxepin (7%), amitriptyline (5%), and lorazepam (5%). Twenty-three percent of study subjects received long-acting benzodiazepines, 10% received short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high doses, and 12% received TCAs designated as potentially inappropriate. Conclusion: GPs in Germany often prescribe medications that have been designated as potentially inappropriate to their elderly patients with GAD - especially those with comorbid depressive disorders. Further research is needed to ascertain whether there are specific subgoups of elderly patients with GAD for whom the benefits of these medications outweigh their risks.","Many drugs often used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been labeled ""potentially inappropriate"" for use in patients 65-years-old and above because they may cause more risks than benefits.

8,16034865,"Background: Antipsychotic drugs are usually given orally but compliance with medication given by this route may be difficult to quantify. The development of depot injections in the 1960s gave rise to extensive use of depots as a means of long-term maintenance treatment. Perphenazine decanoate and enanthate are depot antipsychotics that belong to the phenothiazine family and have a piperazine ethanol side chain. Objectives: To assess the effects of depot perphenazine decanoate and enanthate versus placebo, oral antipsychotics and other depot antipsychotic preparations for people with schizophrenia in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes. Authors' conclusions: Depot perphenazine is in clinical use in the Nordic countries, Belgium, Portugal and the Netherlands. At a conservative estimate, a quarter of a million people suffer from schizophrenia in those countries and could be treated with depot perphenazine. The total number of participants in the four trials with useful data is 313. None of the studies observed the effects of oral versus depot antipsychotic drugs. Until well conducted and reported randomised trials are undertaken clinicians will be in doubt as to the effects of perphenazine depots and people with schizophrenia should exercise their own judgement or ask to be randomised.","Drugs used to treat psychotic disorders are usually given by mouth, but it is hard to measure if people take the drugs as instructed. Slow-releasing shots, created in the 1960s, became popular as long-term treatment to keep conditions stable. Perphenazine decanoate and enanthate are slow-release shots used to treat psychotic disorders. We aimed to measure the medical, social, and economic effects of slow-releasing perphenazine decanoate and enanthate shots compared to no treatment, drugs used to treat psychotic disorders by mouth, and other slow-releasing shots used to treat psychotic disorders for people with schizophrenia (a reality-distorting mental illness). We state that slow-releasing perphenazine shots are used in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Portugal, and the Netherlands. At least 250,000 people have schizophrenia in these countries and could be given slow-releasing perphenazine shots. The four trials with useful results had 313 total people. None of the studies compared the effects of antipsychotics taken by mouth to a slow-releasing shot. People with schizophrenia should use their own judgement until more studies are done and doctors know the effects of slow-release perphenazine shots.",
47,34515659,"Summary: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare and under-recognised genetic defect in bone mineralisation. Patients presenting with fragility fractures may be mistakenly diagnosed as having osteoporosis and prescribed antiresorptive therapy, a treatment which may increase fracture risk. Adult-onset HPPhypophosphatasia was identified in a 40-year-old woman who presented with bilateral atypical femoral fractures after 4 years of denosumab therapy. A low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and increased serum vitamin B6 level signalled the diagnosis, which was later confirmed by identification of two recessive mutations of the ALPL gene. The patient was treated with teriparatide given the unavailability of ALP enzyme-replacement therapy (asfotase alfa). Fracture healing occurred, but impaired mobility persisted. HPP predisposes to atypical femoral fracture (AFF) during antiresorptive therapy; hence, bisphosphonates and denosumab are contraindicated in this condition. Screening patients with fracture or 'osteoporosis' to identify a low ALP level is recommended. Learning points: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare and under-recognised cause of bone fragility produced by impaired matrix mineralisation that can be misdiagnosed as a fragility fracture due to age-related bone loss. Antiresorptive therapy is contraindicated in HPP. Low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) provides a clue to the diagnosis. Elevated serum vitamin B6 (an ALP substrate) is indicative of HPP, while identification of a mutation in the ALPL gene is confirmatory. Enzyme therapy with recombinant ALP (asfotase alfa) is currently prohibitively costly. Treatment with anabolic bone agents such as teriparatide has been reported, but whether normally mineralized bone is formed requires further study.","Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare and under-recognized genetic defect in bone mineralization. Bone mineralization is when bone become calcified. Patients presenting with fragility fractures may be mistakenly diagnosed as having osteoporosis (brittle bones). These patients may be prescribed antiresorptive therapy, or drugs that block the breakdown of bone. These drugs may increase fracture risk. Adult-onset HPP was identified in a 40-year-old woman. She had with femur fractures after 4 years of using denosumba, a drug to treat osteoporosis. A low serum (blood) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and increased serum vitamin B6 level signaled the diagnosis. Her diagnosis of HPP was later confirmed by identification of two recessive gene mutations of the ALPL gene. ALP is an enzyme that helps bone strength. ALPL is the gene that encodes ALP. The patient was treated with teriparatide (an osteoporosis drug) due to the unavailability of ALP enzyme-replacement therapy. The fractures healed. However, her mobility was impaired. HPP makes someone more likely to experience femur fractures during antiresorptive therapy. Because of this, bisphosphonates (drugs that limit bone density) and denosumab should not be given to people with this condition. Healthcare workings should screen patients with fracture or 'osteoporosis' to identify a low ALP level. HPP is a rare and under-recognized cause of bone fragility. HPP is caused by impaired mineralization that can be misdiagnosed as a fragility fracture due to age-related bone loss. Antiresorptive therapy is not recommended in HPP treatment. Low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can aid in diagnosis. Elevated serum vitamin B6 (a chemical that works with ALP) is suggestive of HPP. Identifying mutations within the ALPL gene can confirm HPP status. Therapy with a chemical ALP reacts with, known as asfotase alfa, is currently unmanageably expensive. Treatment with anabolic (repairing) bone agents has been reported. However, if this treatment helps normally mineralized bone form needs further study.",
46,30825185,"Background and purpose: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal autosomal recessive genetic disease that originates from the defective function of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a cAMP-dependent anion channel involved in fluid transport across epithelium. Because small synthetic transmembrane anion transporters (anionophores) can replace the biological anion transport mechanisms, independent of genetic mutations in the CFTR, such anionophores are candidates as new potential treatments for CF. Experimental approach: In order to assess their effects on cell physiology, we have analysed the transport properties of five anionophore compounds, three prodigiosines and two tambjamines. Chloride efflux was measured in large uni-lamellar vesicles and in HEK293 cells with chloride-sensitive electrodes. Iodide influx was evaluated in FRT cells transfected with iodide-sensitive YFP. Transport of bicarbonate was assessed by changes of pH after a NH4 + pre-pulse using the BCECF fluorescent probe. Assays were also carried out in FRT cells permanently transfected with wild type and mutant human CFTR. Key results: All studied compounds are capable of transporting halides and bicarbonate across the cell membrane, with a higher transport capacity at acidic pH. Interestingly, the presence of these anionophores did not interfere with the activation of CFTR and did not modify the action of lumacaftor (a CFTR corrector) or ivacaftor (a CFTR potentiator). Conclusion and implications: These anionophores, at low concentrations, transported chloride and bicarbonate across cell membranes, without affecting CFTR function. They therefore provide promising starting points for the development of novel treatments for CF.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a deadly disease inherited from both parents that is caused when the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein does not work correctly, a channel involved with movement of ions (charged atoms) and fluids in epithelial cells (cells that cover the outer surface of the internal organs). Anionophores, which are small human-made substances that move negative ions (anions) across membranes, can replace biological anion movement regardless of gene changes in the CFTR and are possible treatments for CF. We looked at the movement properties of five anionophore substances. We measured the flow of chloride out of the cell. We measured the flow of iodide into the cell. We measured the movement of bicarbonate (compound). We saw that all five compounds are able to move halides and bicarbonate (compounds) across the cell membrane, with more moved in acidic conditions. Anionophores did not change CFTR activation and did not change the effects of a lumacaftor (corrector that helps the changed protein to move to the cell surface) or ivacaftor (potentiator that holds the gate to the channel open so chloride can flow through the cell membrane). We conclude that anionophores, at low concentrations, moved chloride and bicarbonate (compounds) across cell membranes, without changing CFTR function. New CF treatments could be developed starting from anionophores.",
51,7783363,"Islet cell antibodies (ICA; proteins made against insulin-producing cells) are a marker of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). ICA are detected in 60-80% of the patients with IDDM at the onset of the disease. The presence of ICA in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) indicates that the patients are likely to develop IDDM. However, as ICA are measured by the indirect immunofluorescent method, the reliability of the ICA assay is not high in some institutes. Use of the pancreas tissue having high antigenicity is recommended as one solution for a reliable assay. Standardization of the ICA assay is under way with the use of an ICA positive standard sera as 80 JDF units. Anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) antibody assays using a radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have recently been developed. The significance of anti-GAD antibodies is comparable to that of ICA. Since the anti-GAD assay is reproducible and easy to perform, it should be used widely in parallel with the ICA assay.","Islet cell antibodies (ICA) are an indicator of type 1 diabetes. ICA are found in 60-80% of patients with type 1 diabetes when symptoms first appear. Type 2 diabetics with ICA are likely to develop type 1 diabetes. The current way to measure ICA is not always reliable. A reliable standardized test could use pancreas tissue, tissue from an organ that monitors blood sugar levels. A standardized test to measure ICA is under way. Scientists have recently developed a standardized test to measure anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) antibody, a rare protein. Anti-GAD antibodies and ICA have similar meanings. The standardized test to measure anti-GAD can be repeated and is easy to do, so it should be used widely at the same time as the test to measure ICA.",
13,24088747,"Objective: Nighttime onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) is sometimes associated with obstructive sleep apnea accompanied by a characteristic heart rate (HR) pattern known as cyclical variation of HR. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether cyclical variation of HR is prevalent in patients with nocturnal AF. Methods: The subjects consisted of 34 patients (68±12 years) with paroxysmal AF, including 14 patients with daytime AF and 20 patients with nighttime AF. Holter electrocardiogram (ECGs) were examined for the presence of cyclical variation in HR and to quantify the HR variability within the 40-minute period preceding each AF episode using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods. Results: Cyclical variation in HR was observed in 12 of 20 (60%) nighttime episodes and in only two of 14 (14%) daytime episodes. The prevalence of cyclical variation in HR was significantly greater in the nighttime AF episodes than in the daytime AF episodes (Chi=5.34, p<0.05). The mean frequency of cyclical variation in HR was 0.015±0.003 Hz. The mean power of the VLF (very low frequency) component (0.008-0.04 Hz) before the onset of AF was significantly greater in the nighttime AF episodes than in the daytime AF episodes. Among the nighttime AF episodes, the power of the HF (high frequency), LF (low frequency) and very low frequency (VLF) components increased significantly just before the onset of AF compared with that observed 40 minutes before onset. Conclusion: The high prevalence of cyclical variation in HR observed before nocturnal AF episodes suggests that sleep apnea may play a role in the onset of nighttime AF.","Nighttime onset of atrial fibrillation (a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots or stroke) is sometimes associated with obstructive sleep apnea (where muscles in the throat relax, the airway is narrowed or closed, and breathing is momentarily cut off) along with a specific heart rate pattern called cyclical variation. This study determines whether cyclical variation of heart rate is common in patients with nighttime atrial fibrillation (AF). There are 34 patients in the study with paroxysmal AF (when the heart rate returns to normal within 7 days on its own or with treatment), including 14 patients with daytime AF and 20 patients with nighttime AF. The presence of cyclical variation in heart rate is examined, and the heart rate differences are measured and counted 40 minutes before each AF episode. Cyclical variation in heart rate is found in 12 of 20 (60%) nighttime episodes and only in two of 14 (14%) daytime episodes. Cyclical variation in heart rate was much greater in the nighttime AF than in daytime AF episodes.  The high presence of cyclical variation in heart rate found before nighttime atrial fibrillation episodes suggests that sleep apnea may play a role in the onset of nighttime atrial fibrillation.",
24,2874976,"Buspirone hydrochloride (HCl)1 is a new anxiolytic with a unique chemical structure. Its mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Unlike the benzodiazepines, buspirone lacks hypnotic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant properties, and hence has been termed 'anxioselective'. As evidenced by a few double-blind clinical trials, buspirone 15 to 30 mg/day improves symptoms of anxiety assessed by standard rating scales similarly to diazepam, clorazepate, alprazolam and lorazepam. Like diazepam, buspirone is effective in patients with mixed anxiety/depression, although the number of patients studied to date is small. In several studies, a 'lagtime' of 1 to 2 weeks to the onset of anxiolytic effect has been noted; hence motivation of patient compliance may be necessary. Sedation occurs much less often after buspirone than after the benzodiazepines; other side effects are minor and infrequent. In healthy volunteers, buspirone does not impair psychomotor or cognitive function, and appears to have no additive effect with alcohol. Early evidence suggests that buspirone has limited potential for abuse and dependence. Thus, although only wider clinical use for longer periods of time will more clearly define some elements of its pharmacological profile, with its low incidence of sedation buspirone is a useful addition to the treatments available for generalised anxiety. It may well become the preferred therapy in patients in whom daytime alertness is particularly important.","Buspirone hydrochloride (HCL)1 is a new anti-anxiety drug with a unique molecular makeup. How it works is not yet fully understood. Unlike benzodiazepines, another type of drug to treat anxiety, buspirone is “anxioselective”; that is, it relieves anxiety without the side effects of benzodiazepines (sedation and muscle relaxation). As shown by a few clinical trials, buspirone 15 to 30 mg/day improves symptoms of anxiety using a standard questionnaire similarly to diazepam, clorazepate, alprazolam and lorazepam - other drugs that treat anxiety. Like diazepam, buspirone works in patients with anxiety and depression, although the number of patients studied is small. In many studies, it takes 1 to 2 weeks for anxiety relief after starting buspirone, so doctors may need to encourage patients to keep taking buspirone. Sedation happens much less often with buspirone than benzodiazepines, and other side effects are mild and uncommon. In healthy people, buspirone does not decrease mental processes and physical movement, and seems to not change with drinking alcohol. Early studies suggest buspirone is not likely to be abused or cause dependence. Although only more people taking buspirone for longer will show exactly how it works, it is another option to treat generalized anxiety because it rarely causes sedation. It could become the top treatment in patients who must be alert during the day.","Buspirone hydrochloride (HCl)1 is a new anxiety-reducing drug with a unique chemical structure. The mechanism of action for this anxiety-reducing drug is unknown. Unlike other anxiety-reducing drugs like benzodiazepines, buspirone lacks hypnotic, seizure-reducing, and muscle relaxant traits. Thus, the drug treats anxiety specifically. As shown in a few studies, 15 to 30 mg/day of buspirone improves anxiety symptoms similarly to other common anxiety-reducing drugs. Like anxiety-reducing diazepam, buspirone helps patients with mixed anxiety/depression. However, the number of patients studied is small. In many studies, the anxiety-reducing effect manifests after 1 to 2 weeks, so motivating patients to comply may be needed. Sedation is less frequent with buspirone than with other anxiety-reducing drugs. Other side effects are minor and infrequent. In healthy volunteers, buspirone does not affect movement or thought. It also appears to not strengthen the effects of alcohol. Buspirone may have limited potential for abuse and dependence. Thus, while more use will better define its effects, buspirone rarely leads to sedation and is a useful a treatment option for anxiety. Buspirone may become the preferred treatment for patients who demand daytime alertness."

Perforations of the hollow viscera commonly follow abdominal trauma and likely require surgery for hemorrhage and sepsis source control. We report a case where a high velocity impact of the abdominal wall against the stump of a felled tree caused a TAWH with concomitant gastric perforation in a 20-year-old male patient who required exploratory laparotomy with primary repair of the stomach and fascia. The physical examination findings without previous history of abdominal hernia and pneumoperitoneum in the chest X-ray made suspect our diagnosis and it was confirmed intraoperatively.

35,28285070,"Background: Clinical practice guidelines recommend use of fracture risk scores for screening and pharmacologic treatment decisions. The timing of occurrence of treatment-level (according to 2014 National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines) or screening-level (according to 2011 US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines) fracture risk scores has not been estimated in postmenopausal women. Methods: We conducted a retrospective competing risk analysis of new occurrence of treatment-level and screening-level fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women aged 50 years and older, prior to receipt of pharmacologic treatment and prior to first hip or clinical vertebral fracture. Results: In 54,280 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years without a bone mineral density test, the time for 10% to develop a treatment-level FRAX score could not be estimated accurately because of rare incidence of treatment-level scores. In 6096 women who had FRAX scores calculated with bone mineral density, the estimated unadjusted time to treatment-level FRAX ranged from 7.6 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.6-8.7) for those aged 65 to 69, to 5.1 years (95% CI, 3.5-7.5) for those aged 75 to 79 at baseline. Of 17,967 women aged 50 to 64 with a screening-level FRAX at baseline, 100 (0.6%) experienced a hip or clinical vertebral fracture by age 65 years. Conclusions: Postmenopausal women with sub-threshold fracture risk scores at baseline were unlikely to develop a treatment-level FRAX score between ages 50 and 64 years.

In 54,280 women who had gone through menopause aged 50 to 64 years without a bone mineral density test, we could not estimate the time for 10% to need treatment based on a common osteoporosis questionnaire due to too few scores suggesting treatment. In 6096 women who had scores from a common osteoporosis questionnaire, the estimated time to need treatment was 7.6 years and 5.1 years for those aged 65 to 69 and aged 75 to 79, respectively. Of 17,967 women aged 50 to 64 with an initial screening-level FRAX (or fracture-risk score), 100 (0.6%) broke their hip or spine by age 65 years. We conclude that women who have gone through menopause with questionnaire scores that did not suggest treatment were unlikely to have a score suggesting treatment between ages 50 and 64 years. After age 65, questionnaire scores suggesting treatment, osteoporosis, and serious bone breaks due to osteoporosis suggest doing more questionnaires and bone mineral density testing more often."
35,24809808,"We evaluated the prevalence and geographic variation of short-interval (repeated in under 2 years) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry tests (DXAs) among Medicare beneficiaries. Short-interval DXA use varied across regions (coefficient of variation = 0.64), and unlike other DXAs, rates decreased with payment cuts. Introduction: The American College of Rheumatology, through the Choosing Wisely initiative, identified measuring bone density more often than every 2 years as care ""physicians and patients should question."" We measured the prevalence and described the geographic variation of short-interval (repeated in under 2 years) DXAs among Medicare beneficiaries and estimated the cost of this testing and its responsiveness to payment change. Methods: Using 100 % Medicare claims data, 2006-2011, we identified DXAs and short-interval DXAs for female Medicare beneficiaries over age 66. We determined the population rate of DXAs and short-interval DXAs, as well as Medicare spending on short-interval DXAs, nationally and by hospital referral region (HRR). Results: DXA use was stable 2008-2011 (12.4 to 11.5 DXAs per 100 women). DXA use varied across HRRs: in 2011, overall DXA use ranged from 6.3 to 23.0 per 100 women (coefficient of variation = 0.18), and short-interval DXAs ranged from 0.3 to 8.0 per 100 women (coefficient of variation = 0.64). Short-interval DXA use fluctuated substantially with payment changes; other DXAs did not. Short-interval DXAs, which represented 10.1 % of all DXAs, cost Medicare approximately US$16 million in 2011. Conclusions: One out of ten DXAs was administered in a time frame shorter than recommended and at a substantial cost to Medicare. DXA use varied across regions. Short-interval DXA use was responsive to reimbursement changes, suggesting carefully designed policy and payment reform may reduce this care identified by rheumatologists as low value.","We rated the number and variation (or differences) across the country of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry tests (DXAs - useful tests for measuring bone density) repeated in under 2 years (short-interval) in people on Medicare during a specific period. Use of short-interval DXAs varied across the country and unlike other DXAs, use went down with Medicare payment cuts. A campaign to avoid unnecessary medical tests, treatments and procedures found measuring bone density more often than every 2 years as care ""physicians and patients should question."" We rated the number and variation across the country of short-interval DXAs in people on Medicare during a specific period and estimated the testing cost and how much is changed based on payment. We used only information from Medicare claims in 2006-2011 to find DXAs and short-term DXAs for females over age 66 on Medicare. We found out how many DXAs and short-term DXAs were done, and how many Medicare dollars were spent on short-interval DXAs, across the country and by healthcare markets. From 2008-2011, DXA use was steady (12.4 to 11.5 DXAs per 100 women). DXA use varied across healthcare markets. Short-interval DXA use changed a lot based on payment; other DXAs did not. In 2011, Medicare spent about $16 million USD on short-interval DXAs, which made up 10.1% of all DXAs. We conclude that one out of 10 DXAs was done sooner than recommended, costing Medicare considerably. DXA use varied across the country. Short-interval DXA use changed based on payment, suggesting policy and payment changes may decrease this low-value care.",
46,30349480,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and remains the most common life-shortening diseases affecting the exocrine organs. The absence of this channel results in an imbalance of ion concentrations across the cell membrane and results in more abnormal secretion and mucus plugging in the gastrointestinal tract and in the lungs of CF patients. The direct introduction of fully functional CFTR by gene therapy has long been pursued as a therapeutical option to restore CFTR function independent of the specific CFTR mutation, but the different clinical trials failed to propose persuasive evidence of this strategy. The last ten years has led to the development of new pharmacotherapies which can activate CFTR function in a mutation-specific manner. Although approximately 2,000 different disease-associated mutations have been identified, a single codon deletion, F508del, is by far the most common and is present on at least one allele in approximately 70% of the patients in CF populations. This strategy is limited by chemistry, the knowledge on CFTR and the heterogenicity of the patients. New research efforts in CF aim to develop other therapeutical approaches to combine different strategies. Targeting RNA appears as a new and an important opportunity to modulate dysregulated biological processes. Abnormal miRNA activity has been linked to numerous diseases, and over the last decade, the critical role of miRNA in regulating biological processes has fostered interest in how miRNA binds to and interacts explicitly with the target protein. Herein, this review describes the different strategies to identify dysregulated miRNA opens up a new concept and new opportunities to correct CFTR deficiency. This review describes therapeutic applications of antisense techniques currently under investigation in CF.","Changes in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common life-shortening diseases affecting organs that make and release substances into transporting ducts. The absence of this protein from the CFTR gene causes an imbalance of ion (charged atom) concentrations across the cell membrane and causes release and buildup of abnormally high levels of mucus in the digestive tract and lungs of CF patients. Scientists have tried transferring working CFTR into a patient's cells regardless of the specific CFTR gene change, but patient trials were not successful. New drugs that can stimulate CFTR function based on the specific gene change have been made in the last ten years. Of the roughly 2,000 different gene changes linked to CF, the most common change is F508del, a deletion of a sequence of three consecutive gene compounds, and about 70% of people with CF have at least one form of it. Chemistry, CFTR knowledge, and genetic differences of patients limit the ability to stimulate CFTR function based on the specific gene change. New CF research aims to develop other treatments that combine different approaches. Looking at RNA (which changes the genetic information of DNA into proteins) is a new and important chance to fix incorrectly functioning biological processes. Scientists have linked abnormal microRNA (miRNA; short type of non-coding RNA that does not encode a protein) to many diseases, and over the last decade, scientists have developed interest in how miRNA interacts with specific proteins. We describe different ways to find incorrectly functioning miRNA that might help correct lack of CFTR. This review describes RNA treatments currently being studied in CF.",
22,28970150,"Germline mutations in the novel tumor suppressor gene FLCN are responsible for the autosomal dominant inherited disorder Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome that predisposes to fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax, and an increased risk for developing kidney tumors. Although the encoded protein, folliculin (FLCN), has no sequence homology to known functional domains, x-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the C-terminus of FLCN has structural similarity to DENN (differentially expressed in normal cells and neoplasia) domain proteins that act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for small Rab GTPases. FLCN forms a complex with folliculin interacting proteins 1 and 2 (FNIP1, FNIP2) and with 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This review summarizes FLCN functional studies which support a role for FLCN in diverse metabolic pathways and cellular processes that include modulation of the mTOR pathway, regulation of PGC1α and mitochondrial biogenesis, cell-cell adhesion and RhoA signaling, control of TFE3/TFEB transcriptional activity, amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1 on lysosomes through Rag GTPases, and regulation of autophagy. Ongoing research efforts are focused on clarifying the primary FLCN-associated pathway(s) that drives the development of fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and kidney tumors in BHD patients carrying germline FLCN mutations.","Heritable DNA mutations in the new tumor stopping gene FLCN lead to the genetic Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome. The syndrome causes hair follicle tumors, lung cysts or swellings, collapsed lungs, and an increased risk for kidney tumors. While the full protein, folliculin (FLCN), is not similar to other proteins, one end of FLCN is structurally similar to the ends of other proteins that help activate high-energy proteins. This review summarizes FLCN studies regarding its role in cellular, signaling, and cell structure pathways. Current research is on explaining the FLCN-associated pathway driving the creation of hair follicle tumors, lung cysts, and kidney tumors in BHD patients with heritable FLCN mutations.","Changes in the gene called FLCN, which is a gene that suppresses tumor growth, are responsible for the inherited disorder Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. This syndrome makes people likely to get non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck and chest (fibrofolliculomas), cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs, sudden collapse of the lung, and an increased risk for developing tumors in the kidneys. Some parts of the gene protein, called folliculin, is shown to have a similar structure to other proteins called DENN. FLCN binds with folliculin proteins 1 and 2 (FNIP1, FNIP2) and with a protein kinase that is a critical molecule for energy sensing. This review summarizes other studies that have studied FLCN functions, including its role in how the body distributes nutrients and other cell processes. Ongoing research efforts focus on understanding the ways FLCN may lead to the development of fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts, and kidney tumors in Birt-Hogg-Dubé patients who have the FLCN mutation."
6,31071734,"Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most prevalent autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of thyroid cells caused by leukocytes and antibody-mediated immune processes accompanied by hypothyroidism. In recent years, evidence has emerged pointing to various roles for vitamin D, including, proliferation and differentiation of normal and cancer cells, cardiovascular function, and immunomodulation. Vitamin D deficiency has been especially demonstrated in HT patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin D on circulating thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid hormones profile (T4, T3, and TSH) in females with HT. Forty-two women with HT disease were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial study and divided into vitamin D and placebo groups. Patients in the vitamin D and placebo groups received 50 000 IU vitamin D and placebo pearls, weekly for 3 months, respectively. The serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH) D], Ca++ion, anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (anti-TPO Ab), anti-thyroglobulin antibody (anti-Tg Ab), T4, T3, and TSH were measured at the baseline and at the end of the study using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The results of this study showed a significant reduction of anti-Tg Ab and TSH hormone in the Vitamin D group compared to the start of the study; however, there was a no significant reduction of anti-TPO Ab in the Vitamin D group compared to the placebo group (p=0.08). No significant changes were observed in the serum levels of T3 and T4 hormones. Therefore, vitamin D supplementation can be helpful for alleviation of the disease activity in HT patients; however, further well controlled, large, longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether it can be introduced in clinical practice.","Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most common type of disease caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells and results in an underactive thyroid. Recently, science has shown vitamin D can change how normal and cancer cells grow, divide, and change from one cell to another, how the heart works, and how the body's immune system changes. Too little vitamin D is seen in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This study aimed to determine the effect of vitamin D on thyroid autoantibodies (substances that develop when a person's immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid) and thyroid hormone (T4, T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) blood levels in women. We split 42 women with HT disease into two groups and gave one group vitamin D and the other group sham treatment. We gave one group 50,000 international units of vitamin D and the other group sugar pills for 3 months. We measured blood levels of thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid hormones (T4, T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) at the beginning and end of the study using a common antibody-measuring tool. Blood levels of one antibody and thyroid-stimulating hormone were lower at the end of the study in the group taking vitamin D. The group taking vitamin D and the group taking sugar pills had similar blood levels of another antibody. Blood levels of T3 and T4 hormones did not change in either group. Therefore, taking vitamin D can help people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. However, more large studies done over time are needed to see if it can be used in patient care.",
49,33714971,"BACKGROUND In lymphedema, an imbalance in the formation and absorption of lymph causes accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitium of the most gravity-dependent parts of the body. Diagnosis is usually made based on patient medical history and a physical examination showing a typical appearance of the affected body part. Differential diagnosis is confirmed by imaging. CASE REPORT Primary lymphedema is inherited in through an autosomal dominant pattern. Congestive cardiac failure and non-filarial infections predispose patients to the secondary form of lymphedema, elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (ENV). We present the case of a 65-year-old man with lymphedema praecox complicated by congestive cardiac failure. The patient was experiencing worsening left leg swelling and had a prior history of unilateral leg swelling at puberty. The condition was inherited through an autosomal dominant pattern, as his father, elder brother, and nephew were diagnosed with the same disease. The left leg showed non-pitting edema with indurated, woody skin and lichenification. The right leg had mild pitting edema. There were numerous verrucous folds and cobblestone-like nodules, and plaques and a painless ulcer on the left leg. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide. He was treated with compression stockings and inelastic multi-layer bandaging and was administered limb decongestive treatment. After 1 week of therapy, his swelling had somewhat improved. CONCLUSIONS Various conditions can cause ENV and it can superimpose on any form of hereditary lymphedema. The most effective strategy for this condition seems to be a thorough workup of the underlying cause of the ENV and early intervention.","In lymphedema, an imbalance of a fluid called lymph causes a build up of protein-rich fluid, usually in the arms and legs. Diagnosis is usually made based on patient medical history and a physical examination of the affected body part. The diagnosis may be confirmed by imaging, such as x-rays or another scan. Primary lymphedema, also called hereditary lymphedema, is inherited (passed down from parent to child) through genes. Congestive heart failure (inefficient heart pumping) and infections from soil particles make it easier for patients to develop the secondary form of lymphedema, elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (ENV). ENV is a rare chronic condition caused by ongoing infections with bacteria and causes a part of the body, usually the lower part of the body, to be extremely enlarged. Researchers describe the case of a 65-year-old man with lymphedema complicated by congestive heart failure. The patient was experiencing worsening left leg swelling and had a prior history of leg swelling at puberty (when a child's body changes to become an adult) due to disease. The condition was inherited, as his father, elder brother, and nephew were diagnosed with the same disease. The left leg showed non-pitting edema (there was no indentation when the area of swelling is pressed) with woody skin due to scaring that was also thick and leathery. The right leg had mild pitting edema. There were numerous folds and cobblestone-like lumps, raised red patches of the skin, and a painless ulcer (sore) on the left leg. Lab tests showed high levels of a hormone made by the heart called B-type natriuretic peptide. He was treated with compression stockings and bandaging and given decongestive treatment in the limb which includes several techniques such as draining fluid. After 1 week of therapy, his swelling had somewhat improved. In conclusion, various conditions can cause elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (ENV), and it can be an additional condition on any form of hereditary lymphedema. The most effective strategy for this condition seems to be a detailed workup of the underlying cause of the ENV and early treatment and management.",
36,34346246,"Mini-Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (M-PCNL) and Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS) are commonly used methods in treatment of kidney stones. The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy and safety of M-PCNL and RIRS in kidney stone treatment over 50 years old patients. A total of 125 patients, 65 of whom had RIRS, and 60 of whom had M-PCNL, were included in the study. Age, gender, BMI (Body-Mass Index), ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) scores of the patients; stone size, stone location, operation side, ESWL history, HU (Hounsfield Unit) values, hospital stay durations, SFR, complication rates according to Clavien modification system, postoperative hemoglobin loss, postoperative transfusion rates, and patients who needed a secondary operation were recorded. SFR values were calculated in the postoperative third and sixth months. The data between the two groups had similar characteristics in terms of age, gender, BMI, HU, stone size, operation side, stone location, ESWL history, operation time, postoperative transfusion rate, postoperative Clavien complications (p > 0.05). When the ASA categories were evaluated, the mean ASA scores, ASA I, and ASA II data had similar characteristics in both groups (p > 0.05). When the ASA 3 scores were evaluated, the number of ASA III patients in the RIRS group was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.05). When hospital stay duration and postoperative hemoglobin loss were examined, RIRS group was found to be advantageous (p < 0.05). Postoperative third month SFR and Postoperative sixth month values were statistically significantly higher in M-PCNL group (p < 0.05). M-PCNL and RIRS are methods that can be used safely and effectively over 50 years old patients in kidney stone surgery. M-PCNL has been found to be more advantageous in terms of SFR rates and as it requires less secondary intervention. RIRS is advantageous in terms of short hospital stay, postoperative hemoglobin loss, and applicability to patients who are not suitable for the prone position.","Two common ways to treat kidney stones are: the Mini-Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (M-PCNL), which is when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a scope to remove kidney stones, and Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS), a procedure that uses a laser and a viewing tube to remove kidney stones and does not make an external incision. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of M-PCNL and RIRS in kidney stone treatment in patients over 50 years old. A total of 125 patients, 65 who had RIRS, and 60 who had M-PCNL, are included in the study.

43,33336616,"Introduction: Cardiac stimulation evolved from life-saving devices to prevent asystole to the treatment of heart rhythm disorders and heart failure, capable of remote patient and disease-progression monitoring. Cardiac stimulation nowadays aims to correct the electrophysiologic roots of mechanical inefficiency in different structural heart diseases. Areas covered: Clinical experience, as per available literature, has led to awareness of the concealed risks of customary cardiac pacing, that can inadvertently cause atrio-ventricular and inter/intra-ventricular dyssynchrony. New pacing modalities have emerged, leading to a new concept of what truly represents 'physiologic pacing' beyond maintenance of atrio-ventricular coupling. In this article we will analyze the emerging evidence in favor of the available strategies to achieve an individualized physiologic setting in bradycardia pacing, and the hints of future developments. Expert opinion: 'physiologic stimulation' technologies should evolve to enable an effective and widespread adoption. In one way new guiding catheters and the adoption of electrophysiologic guidance and non-fluoroscopic lead implantation are needed to make His-Purkinje pacing successful and effective at long term in a shorter procedure time; in the other way leadless stimulation needs to upgrade to a superior physiologic setting to mimic customary DDD pacing and possibly His-Purkinje pacing.","The process of stimulating the heart grew from life-saving devices that prevent asystole (when the activity in the heart stops or ""flatline"") to the treatment of heart rhythm disorders and heart failure. Cardiac stimulation nowadays aims to correct the physical root cause of heart problems in different heart diseases. Doctors' experiences have led to an awareness of the hidden risks of standard pacing methods to get the heart beat back to normal that can lead to unexpected heart problems. New pacing methods have come about, leading to a new idea of what truly represents 'physiologic pacing' beyond making sure the two parts of the heart beat in a good rhythm. This article analyzes new evidence that supports the available methods to create a setting in bradycardia (slow heart beat) pacing that is tailored for the individual. The article also discusses future developments. The expert opinion is that 'physiologic stimulation' methods should develop to allow effective and far-reaching use. In one way, new guiding catheters (flexible tubes), the use of specific tests to check the heart's electrical system, and implanting devices using imaging tools are needed to make pacing successful and effective in the long term, but leads to a shorter procedure time. In the other way, stimulation without using wires needs to upgrade to a better physical setting to mimic customary DDD (dual-chamber antibradycardia that can stimulate the chambers of the heart) pacing and possibly His-Purkinje pacing, the rapid electric conduction in the ventricles (lower heart chambers).",
8,25290157,"Background: Antipsychotic drugs are the core treatment for schizophrenia. Treatment guidelines state that there is no difference in efficacy between the various first-generation antipsychotics, however, low-potency first-generation antipsychotic drugs are sometimes perceived as less efficacious than high-potency first-generation compounds by clinicians, and they also seem to differ in their side effects. Authors' conclusions: The results do not show a superiority in efficacy of high-potency perphenazine compared with low-potency first-generation antipsychotics. There is some evidence that perphenazine is more likely to cause akathisia and less likely to cause severe toxicity, but most adverse effect results were equivocal. The number of studies as well as the quality of studies is low, with quality of evidence for the main outcomes ranging from moderate to very low, so more randomised evidence would be needed for conclusions to be made.","Drugs used to treat psychotic disorders are the main treatment for schizophrenia (a reality-distorting mental illness). Treatment recommendations say there is no difference in treatment effect among older drugs used to treat psychotic disorders. However, doctors sometimes think older drugs with lower strength used to treat psychotic disorders do not work as well as older drugs with higher strength, and they also seem to have different side effects. We conclude that the results do not show that the antipsychotic perphenazine with its higher strength works better than older antipsychotics with lower strength. Some evidence exists that perphenazine is more likely to cause restlessness and less likely to cause drug toxicity in the bloodstream requiring hospitalization, but most side effects were the same. More evidence is needed to make judgements, as the number and quality of studies is low with medium- to very low-quality results.",
21,28828685,"Purpose: Hiatal hernias are a common finding on radiographic or endoscopic studies. Hiatal hernias may become symptomatic or, less frequently, can incarcerate or become a volvulus leading to organ ischemia. This review examines latest evidence on the diagnostic workup and management of hiatal hernias. Methods: A literature review of contemporary and latest studies with highest quality of evidence was completed. This information was examined and compiled in review format. Results: Asymptomatic hiatal and paraesophageal hernias become symptomatic and necessitate repair at a rate of 1% per year. Watchful waiting is appropriate for asymptomatic hernias. Symptomatic hiatal hernias and those with confirmed reflux disease require operative repair with an anti-reflux procedure. Key operative steps include the following: reduction and excision of hernia sac, 3 cm of intraabdominal esophageal length, crural closure with mesh reinforcement, and an anti-reflux procedure. Repairs not amenable to key steps may undergo gastropexy and gastrostomy placement as an alternative procedure. Conclusions: Hiatal hernias are commonly incidental findings. When hernias become symptomatic or have reflux disease, an operative repair is required. A minimally invasive approach is safe and has improved outcomes.","Hiatal hernias, which occur when the upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm into the chest, are often found by x-ray and using a long, thin tube with a camera to look inside the body. Hiatal hernias may cause symptoms or, less often, can become trapped or twisted, cutting off blood flow to organs. This review looks at the latest studies on the diagnosis and treatment of hiatal hernias. We reviewed the strongest current and most recent studies. We studied this information and put it in an easily reviewable format. We found that hiatal hernias without symptoms develop symptoms and need repair at a rate of 1% per year. Watching without treatment unless symptoms appear or change is suggested for people with hernias with no symptoms. Hiatal hernias with symptoms and those with stomach acid reflux disease need surgery with an anti-reflux procedure. Surgery has key steps. When these key steps can't be done, stitching the stomach to the diaphragm and inserting a feeding tube is another option. We conclude that hiatal hernias are often found when looking for something else. When hernias cause symptoms or have reflux disease, surgery is needed. A minimally invasive treatment is safe and has improved results.","Hiatal hernias, in which the stomach bulges into the chest, are common clinical findings. Hiatal hernias can lead to unwanted symptoms, trapped or twisted intestines, and reduced blood flow to certain body parts. This review examines the latest works on identifying and managing these stomach bulges into the chest.  No-symptom stomach or organ bulges into the chest acquire symptoms and need repair at a rate of 1% per year. Watchful waiting is appropriate for these no-symptom organ bulges into the chest. Hiatal hernias with unwanted symptoms and stomach acid reflux into throat need special, anti-reflux surgery. Key surgery steps include: cutting out the bulging sac, 3 cm of the lower esophagus, closing the site with mesh, and an anti-acid reflux operation. Repairs not possible with common surgery may need stitching and opening of the stomach instead. Hiatal hernias are common. When organ bulges lead to awful symptoms or stomach acid reflux, surgery is needed. A small incision surgery is safe and has improved outcomes."
16,26972611,"Corticosteroids have been used for decades to modulate inflammation therapeutically, yet there is a paucity of data on their effects in humans. We examined the changes in cellular and molecular immune system parameters, or ""immunome"", in healthy humans after systemic corticosteroid administration. We used multiplexed techniques to query the immunome in 20 volunteers at baseline, and after intravenous hydrocortisone (HC) administered at moderate (250 mg) and low (50 mg) doses, to provide insight into how corticosteroids exert their effects. We performed comprehensive phenotyping of 120 lymphocyte subsets by high dimensional flow cytometry, and observed a decline in circulating specific B and T cell subsets, which reached their nadir 4-8 hours after administration of HC. However, B and T cells rebounded above baseline 24 hours after HC infusion, while NK cell numbers remained stable. Whole transcriptome profiling revealed down regulation of NF-κB signaling, apoptosis, and cell death signaling transcripts that preceded lymphocyte population changes, with activation of NK cell and glucocorticoid receptor signaling transcripts. Our study is the first to systematically characterize the effects of corticosteroids on the human immunome, and we demonstrate that HC exerts differential effects on B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in humans. Fauci et al. reported that 400 mg and 100 mg doses of HC cause a transient nadir in circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes at 4–6 hours and recovery to baseline after 24 hours. Our data are consistent with these observations. We also observed differential effects of the two steroid doses on lymphocyte recovery at 24 hours, with total T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells rebounding above baseline after the 250 mg dose and total NK cells showing no increase above baseline at 24 hours. HC induced a rapid decline in circulating monocytes and mRNAs related to innate immune signaling as early as one hour after infusion. These effects preceded neutrophil demargination and lymphocyte depletion.","Steroid hormones have long been used to control inflammation, yet there is a shortage of data on their effects in humans. We examined the changes in cellular and molecular immune system measurements, or ""immunome"" in healthy humans after full-body steroid hormone treatment. We used multi-measurement techniques to find immune system measurements in 20 volunteers at baseline and after hydrocortisone (HC) (steroid hormone) treatment via blood vessel injection at moderate (250 mg) and low (50 mg) doses. We did this to understand how steroid hormones bring about their effects. We examine physical traits of 120 immune cell subsets by a specific molecular technique, and saw a decline in blood-specific, immune-cell subsets, which reached their minimum 4-8 hours after HC treatment. However, B and T immune cells increased above baseline 24 hours after HC treatment, while natural killer immune cell numbers did not change. A specific lab technique showed reduced protein signaling and cell death before immune-cell group sizes changed, with activation of natural killer immune cells and energy-monitoring, steroid hormone receptor molecules. Our study is the first to explore the effects of steroid hormones on human immune system measurements. We show that HC has different effects on human B and T immune cells and natural killer immune cells. Facui et al. showed that 400 mg and 100 mg doses of HC cause a temporary minimum in outer blood immune cells at 4-6 hours and recovery to baseline after 24 hours. Our data agree with these results. We also show different effects of the two steroid doses on immune cell recovery at 24 hours, with total T immune cells, specific sub-type T immune cells, and B immune cells increasing after the 250 mg dose. Also, total natural killer immune cells show no increases at 24 hours. HC leads to a rapid decline in white blood cells and pre-protein molecules related to immune signaling as early as one hour after treatment. These effects preexist migration and reduction of specific immune cell subtypes.","Corticosteroids (an anti-inflammatory drug or supplement to help relieve pain and swelling, also known as steroids) have been used for decades to relieve inflammation, yet there is little data on their effects in humans. Researchers examine the changes in cells and molecules of the immune system, also known as the immunome, in healthy humans after receiving systemic (affecting the entire body, rather than a single organ or body part) corticosteroids. Researchers use multiple ways to examine the immunome in 20 volunteers at baseline (the start of the study), and again after intravenous (medication delivered through the vein) hydrocortisone (steroid medication) given at moderate and low doses. A thorough review of cell characteristics of lymphocytes subsets (parts of a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system) saw a decline in B cell subsets that work with substances found in body fluids and in T-cell subsets that focus on specific foreign substances after receiving hydrocortisone. However, B and T cells rebounded or increased above baseline 24 hours after receiving hydrocortisone, while natural killer cell numbers (white blood cells that kill cells infected with a virus) remained stable. Additional analysis found several results: less responsive signaling from NF-κB (proteins involved in different cell functions including immunity responses), apoptosis (normal cell death), and cell death signaling that comes before changes in lymphocytes amount, with activation of signaling in natural killer cells and glucocorticoid receptors (receptors that regulates genes controlling development, metabolism, and immune response). This study is the first to methodically describe the effects of corticosteroids on the human immunome and showed that hydrocortisone has different effects on B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in humans. A different study reports that at certain doses, hydrocortisone can cause short-term low level in blood lymphocytes several hours after receiving the drug and return to baseline levels (at the start of the study) after 24 hours. Data from the present study have similar results. Different effects are found in the two steroid doses on lymphocytes returning to normal at 24 hours, with total T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells increasing above baseline after the high dose and total natural killer cells showing no increase above baseline at 24 hours. Hydrocortisone brings about a rapid decline in monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria) and mRNA (a strand of genetic code that provides instructions for building a protein) related to natural immune signaling as early as one hour after receiving the hydrocortisone. These effects come before neutrophil demargination, which increases white blood cells, and a reduction in lymphocytes."
8,1000139,"The chemical structure of a neuroleptic does not relaibly predict the exact profile of its therapeutic action. We considered the question whether the biochemical action of a neuroleptic, and specifically the ratio between DA-receptor block and NA-receptor block, might have a higher predictive value in this respect. In this context we carried out a double-blind study of the therapeutic value of clozapine and perphenazine in acute psychoses of varying symptomatology and aetiology. There are strong indications that clozapine has only a slight inhibitory effect on transmission in central DA-ergic neurons, but markedly inhibits transmission in central NA-ergic neurons, and that the reverse applies to perphenazine. In view of these data we expected perphenazine to be a stronger antipsychotic and a weaker sedative than clozapine, and vice versa. The plausibility of this hypothesis was demonstrated. Partly also on the basis of earlier research, we concluded that the biochemical action of a neuroleptic is a more faithful predictor of its therapeutic action profile than the chemical structure.","The chemical structure (arrangement of chemical bonds between atoms in a molecule) of drugs used to treat psychotic disorders does not reliably predict how well the treatment works. We looked into whether the biological and chemical changes made to the body by a drug to treat psychotic disorders might better predict how well the treatment works. We did a study of how well antipsychotics clozapine and perphenazine treat short-term impaired relationships with reality with varying symptoms and causes. Data suggest that clozapine and perphenazine have opposite effects on two types of neurons or brain cells. We thought that perphenazine would be a stronger drug to treat impaired relationships with reality and a weaker sedative than clozapine, and vice versa. This assumption proved reasonable. Partly based on earlier research, we concluded that the biological and chemical changes to the body made by a drug used to treat psychotic disorders better predicts how well the treatment works than the arrangement of chemical bonds between atoms in a molecule.",
23,32668217,"Phenylketonuria (PKU), caused by variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, is the most common autosomal-recessive Mendelian phenotype of amino acid metabolism. We estimated that globally 0.45 million individuals have PKU, with global prevalence 1:23,930 live births (range 1:4,500 [Italy]-1:125,000 [Japan]). Comparing genotypes and metabolic phenotypes from 16,092 affected subjects revealed differences in disease severity in 51 countries from 17 world regions, with the global phenotype distribution of 62% classic PKU, 22% mild PKU, and 16% mild hyperphenylalaninemia. A gradient in genotype and phenotype distribution exists across Europe, from classic PKU in the east to mild PKU in the southwest and mild hyperphenylalaninemia in the south. The c.1241A>G (p.Tyr414 Cys)-associated genotype can be traced from Northern to Western Europe, from Sweden via Norway, to Denmark, to the Netherlands. The frequency of classic PKU increases from Europe (56%) via Middle East (71%) to Australia (80%). Of 758 PAH variants, c.1222C> T (p.Arg408Trp) (22.2%), c.1066-11G>A (IVS10-11G>A) (6.4%), and c.782G> A (p.Arg261Gln) (5.5%) were most common and responsible for two prevalent genotypes: p.[Arg408Trp];[Arg408 Trp] (11.4%) and c.[1066-11G>A];[1066-11G>A] (2.6%). Most genotypes (73%) were compound heterozygous, 27% were homozygous, and 55% of 3,659 different genotypes occurred in only a single individual. PAH variants were scored using an allelic phenotype value and correlated with pre-treatment blood phenylalanine concentrations (n = 6,115) and tetrahydrobiopterin loading test results (n = 4,381), enabling prediction of both a genotype-based phenotype (88%) and tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness (83%). This study shows that large genotype databases enable accurate phenotype prediction, allowing appropriate targeting of therapies to optimize clinical outcome.","Phenylketonuria (PKU), caused by genetic alterations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, is the most common disorder inherited from both parents in which the degree the body can properly turn food (and the protein phenylalanine) into energy can be predicted from genetic makeup. Severe PKU leads to an inability to properly convert food. We estimated that 0.45 million individuals have PKU worldwide at a given point in time, occurring in 1 in 23,930 live births (range: 1 in 4,500 [Italy]-1 in 125,000 [Japan]). Comparing genetic makeups and observable PKU symptoms from 16,092 affected people showed differences in disease seriousness in 51 countries from 17 world regions, with the worldwide observable PKU symptoms being 62% classic PKU, 22% mild PKU, and 16% mild elevated phenylalanine blood levels. Observable PKU symptoms and genetic makeups differ across Europe, from classic PKU in the east to mild PKU in the southwest and mild elevated phenylalanine blood levels in the south. A specific genetic alteration can be followed from Northern to Western Europe, from Sweden through Norway, to Denmark, to the Netherlands. The part of the population with classic PKU at any point in time increases from Europe (56%) through the Middle East (71%) to Australia (80%). Of 758 genetic alterations, three were the most common (22.2%, 6.4%, and 5.5%, respectively) and caused two widespread genetic types at any point in time (11.4% and 2.6%, respectively). Most genetic makeups (73%) were compound heterozygous (both forms of the gene have different mutations), 27% were homozygous (both forms of the gene have the same mutation), and 55% of 3,659 different genetic makeups happened in only one person. Genetic alterations associated with PAH were scored and connected with pre-treatment blood phenylalanine levels (6,115 patients) and results from a test to predict long-term treatment responsiveness (4,381 patients). This allowed prediction of both observable PKU symptoms based on genetic makeup and treatment responsiveness. This study shows that large databases of genetic makeups allow correct prediction of observable PKU symptoms, which allows doctors to choose the right therapies to improve patient results.",
42,34667098,"Histones constitute the chief protein component of DNA. They help to maintain chromatin structure and regulate gene expression. The long double-stranded DNA molecule winds around histone octamers to form nucleosomes which serve the purpose of compacting DNA within the confines of the nuclear membrane. There are five major types of histones, namely H1/H5, H2, H3 and H4. H3.3 is a subtype of H3 histone and can be encoded either by the H3F3A or H3F3B genes independently. Amino acids such as lysine and arginine found in the histone tails are sites of post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as methylation and acetylation. These PTMs in histones are involved in the regulation of gene expression by chromatin remodelling and by controlling DNA methylation patterns. Mutations in histone genes can affect sites of PTMs causing changes in local and global DNA methylation status. These effects are directly linked to neoplastic transformation by altered gene expression. Recurrent H3.3 histone mutations are increasingly identified in several malignancies and developmental disorders. The following review attempts to shed light on the diseases associated with H3.3 histone mutations.","Histones make up the chief protein part of DNA.

16,2199128,"The growth of knowledge in the field of the pharmacokinetics of prednisolone/prednisone has been slow for several reasons. First, convenient and specific methods for measuring these steroids only became available with the development of high performance liquid chromatographic methods. Secondly, prednisolone is nonlinearly bound to transcortin and albumin: since the unbound concentrations of prednisolone are biologically relevant, it was necessary to determine the free fraction in each plasma sample. Thirdly, due to the short half-life of prednisolone no steady-state is achieved, and therefore area under the concentration-time curve needed to be determined in all studies. Fourthly, prednisolone and prednisone are interconvertible and prednisolone is given intravenously as an ester prodrug, features which created controversies about the correct interpretation of pharmacokinetic results. Finally, the total body clearances of total and (to a lesser degree) of unbound prednisolone increase with increasing concentrations of prednisolone. Therefore, in order to compare pharmacokinetic results between different subjects, standardised doses had to be administered. The investigations performed so far have revealed that: (1) the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics partly explain the clinical observation that an alternate-day regimen with prednisone yields fewer biological effects; (2) the interconversion of prednisone into prednisolone is not a limiting factor, even in patients with severely impaired liver function; (3) hypoproteinaemia per se does not cause increased unbound concentrations of prednisolone in vivo; (4) patients with liver failure, renal failure or a renal transplant, subjects older than 65 years, women on estrogen-containing oral contraceptive steroids or subjects taking ketoconazole have increased unbound concentrations of prednisolone-whereas hyperthyroid patients, some patients with Crohn's disease, subjects taking microsomal liver enzyme-inducing agents or patients on intravenous prednisolone phthalate (instead of prednisolone phosphate) or on some brands of enteric coated prednisolone tablets have decreased concentrations of prednisolone. The biological relevance of the altered pharmacokinetics is supported in part by altered clinical effects and altered effects on cellular immunofunctions.","The growth of knowledge in the activity of prednisolone/prednisone (a steroid hormone with immunosuppressant effects) has been slow for many reasons. First, convenient and specific methods to measure these steroids only became available with the creation of advanced lab techniques. Secondly, prednisolone is connected to certain liver proteins. Since the unconnected amounts of prednisolone are important, it was necessary to measure the unconnected amount in each blood sample. Thirdly, due to the short span of prednisolone, no balance is achieved. Thus, specific measurements needed to always be measured. Fourthly, prednisolone and prednisone are interchangeable and prednisolone is given into the blood in an inactive form, attributes which created issues about correct interpretation of the lab results. Finally, the full-body removal of total and unconnected prednisolone increase with increasing amounts of prednisolone. Therefore, to compare lab results between different patients, measured doses had to be given. The tests performed have shown that (1) the dose-dependent drug reactions partly explain observations that an every-other-day schedule with prednisone leads to less biological effects. (2) The change of prednisone into prednisolone is not limiting, even in patients with very damaged liver function. (3) Subnormal protein levels do not cause increased amounts of unbound prednisolone in living beings. (4) Patients with liver failure, kidney failure or a kideny transplant, subjects older than 65 years, women on estrogen-containing, pregnancy-preventing, oral steroids or subjects taking ketoconazole (an antifungal medication) have increased amounts of unbound prednisolone. However, patients with overactive thyroids, some patients with Crohn's disease (an inflammatory bowel disease), subjects taking specific liver medication, or patients on a specific prednisolone given into the blood (instead of another form of prednisolone) or on some brands of intenstinally-related prednisolone tablets have decreased amounts of prednisolone. The importance of these changed drug reactions is supported partly by changed clinical effects and changed effects on cellular immunofunctions.","The growth of knowledge in the field of pharmacokinetics (how the body handles a drug) of prednisolone/prednisone (two types of steroid drugs) has been slow for several reasons. First, the most convenient and specific way to measure these steroid drugs only became possible with the development of high performance liquid chromatographic methods, a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze. Secondly, it is necessary to understand the free fraction, or portion of the drug that has an effect on the body, of prednisolone in each plasma (the liquid portion of blood) sample. Third, due to the short half-life (how long it takes for a drug concentration to be reduced to exactly half its initial amount in the blood) of prednisolone, there is no steady state (when how much the body is given of prednisolone is equal to how much of the drug the body eliminates). Therefore, the area under the concentration-time curve (a measure of total exposure to the drug in the body's systems) is needed. Fourth, prednisolone and prednisone can be exchanged for one another or converted to the other, and prednisolone is given intravenously or via injection. These features create disagreement about the correct way to understand how the body is able to handle these drugs. Finally, the total amount of prednisolone that is cleared from the body and the total amount of prednisolone that has an effect on the body increase with more concentration of prednisolone. Therefore, in order to compare pharmacokinetic results (how the body responds to or handles a drug) between different people, the same dose has to be given to patients. The investigations done so far reveal that: 1) using the amount of dose to understand the body's effect explains why an alternate- or every-other-day treatment with prednisone leads to fewer effects in the body; 2) it is not a limiting factor that prednisone can convert to prednisolone; 3) hypoproteinaemia (lower than normal levels of protein in the body) does not cause an increase of the amount of drug in the body that can have an effect; 4) patients with liver failure, kidney failure, or kidney transplant, as well as people with other conditions, have an increased amount of the prednisolone drugs - while patients with other conditions such as Crohn's disease have decreased amounts of prednisolone. The biological importance of the changes in how the body handles these steroids is supported, in part, by changes at the clinical and immune cell level."

15,27536695,"Background: Potassium (K(+)) is the major intracellular cation, with 98% of the total pool being located in the cells at a concentration of 140-150 mmol/l, and only 2% in the extracellular fluid, where it ranges between 3.5 and 5 mmol/l. A fine regulation of the intracellular-extracellular gradient is crucial for life, as it is the main determinant of membrane voltage; in fact, acute changes of K(+) plasma levels may have fatal consequences. Summary: An integrated system including an 'internal' and 'external' control prevents significant fluctuations of plasma levels in conditions of K(+) loading and depletion. The internal control regulates the intra-extracellular shift, a temporary mechanism able to maintain a constant K(+) plasma concentration without changing the total amount of body K(+). The external control is responsible for the excretion of the ingested K(+), and it has the kidney as the major player. The kidney excretes nearly 90% of the daily intake. Along the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb on Henle's loop, the amount of K(+) reabsorption is quite fixed (about 80-90%); conversely, the distal nephron has the ability to adjust K(+) excretion in accordance with homeostatic needs. The present review analyzes: (1) the main molecular mechanisms mediating K(+) reabsorption and secretion along the nephron; (2) the pathophysiology of the principal K(+) derangements due to renal dysfunction, and (3) the effect of ingested K(+) on blood pressure and renal electrolyte handling. Key messages: Maintaining plasma K(+) levels in a tight range is crucial for life; thus, multiple factors are implicated in K(+) homeostasis, including kidney function. Recent studies have suggested that K(+) plasma levels, in turn, affect renal salt absorption in animal models; this effect may underlie the reduction of blood pressure observed in hypertensive subjects under K(+) supplementation.","There is a large amount of potassium (a mineral the body needs to function properly) in the fluid within cells. Regulating or monitoring how potassium passes in and out of cells is very important, so sudden or major changes of potassium levels in the blood may be life-threatening. The body has a system with 'internal' and 'external' controls that prevents changes of blood levels when potassium is increasing or decreasing. The 'internal' control monitors the change in potassium as it moves in and out of cells to help maintain a stable level of potassium. The 'external' control is responsible for excreting (releasing) the potassium, and the kidney is the main part of this process. The kidney releases nearly 90% of the daily intake of potassium. In some parts within the kidney, potassium is reabsorbed at a fixed or constant amount, but other portions of the kidneys have the ability to adjust the release of potassium based on what is needed to maintain a potassium balance. This review analyzes the following: (1) the cell processes that reabsorb and release potassium along the nephron (a filter located in the kidneys); (2) the pathophysiology (functional changes in the body that come with a particular syndrome or disease) from renal (kidney-related) problems; and (3) the effect of ingested potassium from food on blood pressure and renal electrolytes. Key messages in this review are that maintaining potassium levels in the blood in a tight range is very important for life. Therefore, multiple factors are connected with potassium homeostasis (the correct amount of potassium for the body to function), including kidney function. Recent studies with animals have suggested that potassium levels affect renal (kidney-related) salt absorption and this effect may be the cause of decreased blood pressure in hypertensive (high-blood pressure) patients using potassium supplements.",

Aim: Aim of the study was to determine the trends of hCG levels in EP and to explore the role of hCG in decisions related to management and follow-up of EPs. Materials and methods: A retrospective study of women who had EPs from January 2006 to December 2012 at an advanced tertiary care centre in southern India was carried out. These women had undergone treatment based on the hospital protocol. Results: The study identified 337 women with EP. Thirty one surgically confirmed cases were diagnosed below the discriminatory zone of 1500 mIU/ml. Among women who had Beta hCG estimations 48 hours apart, plateauing was observed in 22.5% while decrease >15% was noted in 26.8%. Almost half (47.9%) of the cases had an increase >15% and a few (2.8%) demonstrated an initial fall followed by a rise in titres. In 23.9% of these women, there was a rise >53% similar to intrauterine pregnancy. The average pre-treatment Beta hCG was 429.8, 3866.2 and 12961.5 mIU/ml for those who received expectant, medical and direct surgical treatment respectively. 43 women with relative contraindications received medical management and 39 were lost to follow-up after medical and expectant management. Excluding them, the success rate of these two modalities was 76.6% and 85.0% respectively. Conclusion: No single level of Beta hCG is diagnostic of EP and serial levels can demonstrate atypical trends in some cases.

For you as a patient, these guidelines outline the best rehabilitation treatment options based on the scientific research. Ultimately, the best care is a combination of the leading science, the clinical expertise of your health care provider, and your input as the patient. These guidelines help inform the first step in that process. Practical Advice: Physical therapists are well trained to assess and evaluate people with carpal tunnel syndrome. Although some patients (anywhere from 28% to 62%) recover without treatment, others (from 32% to 58%) get worse. A key to nonsurgical treatment shown to help those with carpal tunnel syndrome is the use of a night brace; a night brace should hold your wrist in a neutral position and only be worn for short-term symptom relief. If you have mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, stretching exercises and the night brace can help, as can manual therapy of your cervical spine and upper extremity performed by a therapist. Education on the proper setup of your computer, especially the mouse, and how hard you strike the keyboard may also help control your symptoms of pain and loss of feeling. The literature review for these guidelines found that low-level laser therapy, thermal ultrasound, iontophoresis, and magnets provided no consistent benefit in treating carpal tunnel syndrome. If nonsurgical treatment does not help, you may need surgery. Your physical therapist can help guide your recovery, decreasing your symptoms.","Pain and a loss of feeling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and part of the ring finger may be a sign of carpal tunnel syndrome (pinched nerves in the wrist). This syndrome and the pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand is caused by pressure on the main nerve at the front of the forearm as it travels through the carpal tunnel, a narrow passageway at the base of the hand that is made of ligaments and bone. Guidelines from the May 2019 issue of Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy, a scientific journal, make recommendations for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating carpal tunnel syndrome. For patients, these guidelines outline the best rehabilitation treatment options (care that can help people regain, keep, or improve abilities needed for daily life) based on the scientific research. Ultimately, the best care is a combination of three things: 1) the leading science, 2) the knowledge, experience, and skills of a patient's health care provider, and 3) the patient's own input. These guidelines help inform the first step in that process. Physical therapists are people who help injured or ill people improve movement and manage pain. They are well trained to help people with carpal tunnel syndrome. Although some patients (anywhere from 28% to 62%) recover without treatment, others (from 32% to 58%) get worse. A key to nonsurgical treatment shown to help those with carpal tunnel syndrome is the use of a night brace; a night brace should hold the wrist in a neutral position (where the joints are not being bent) and only be worn for short-term symptom relief. For patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, stretching exercises and the night brace can help. Manual therapy (hands-on therapy without using a machine or device) of the neck and arms performed by a therapist can also help. Education on the proper setup of computers, especially the mouse, and how hard patients should strike the keyboard may also help control symptoms of pain and loss of feeling. Research shows that low-level laser therapy (a laser light used at a low level applied to the skin to reduce pain and help the body heal), thermal ultrasound (a device that provides heat to tissues to increase circulation and reduce pain), iontophoresis (a procedure that uses an electrical current to deliver medicine through the skin), and magnets provided no consistent benefit in treating carpal tunnel syndrome. If nonsurgical treatment does not help, surgery may be needed. A physical therapist can help guide a patient's recovery and decrease symptoms.",
7,22432746,"The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases established the Sore Throat Guideline Group to write an updated guideline to diagnose and treat patients with acute sore throat. In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3-4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0-2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3-4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length.","A European society created a group to update guidelines to identify and treat patients with sore throat. Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen, or foreign protein, testing can help target antibiotics (antibacterial medication). The Centor scoring system can help identify those with higher risk of group A streptococcal or strep bacterial infection. In patientis with high risk of streptoccal bacterial infections, physicians may use rapid antigen, or foreign protein, testing (RAT). If rapid antigen testing is used, testing isolated throat cells are not needed for identifying group A strep bacterial infection if no antigens are detected. Either ibuprofen or paracetamol, common pain relievers, can help relieve immediate sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate, a dietary supplement, is not recommeded with a sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence that herbal treatments or acupuncture treats sore throat. Patients with less severe sore throats should not use antibiotics to relieve symptoms. Limited benefits of antibiotics, seen in patients with severe sore throat, have to be weighed against antibiotic side effects, its effects on bacteria, medicalisation and costs. Preventing pus is not a sign for antibacterial medication in sore throat. If using antibiotics, penicillin V, two or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. Currently, there is not enough evidence for shorter treatment length.","A European scientific organization made a Sore Throat Guideline Group to write a new guideline to diagnose and treat people with short-term sore throat. A common sore throat scoring survey or a rapid strep test involving a quick throat swab to find bacterial fragments can be useful in deciding which antibiotic to use. The sore throat scoring survey can help identify people who are more likely to have group A strep, caused by group A strep bacteria. Doctors might use a rapid strep test in people who are highly likely to have strep throat based on the sore throat scoring survey. If the rapid strep test shows no strep infection, a throat swab to find, grow, and test bacteria in the throat that make you sick is not needed. Advil or Tylenol can help short-term sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate should not be used in sore throat. It is unclear whether herbal treatments and acupuncture can help sore throat. People with less serious sore throat (low throat scoring survey score, for example) should not use antibiotics to help sore throat. Moderate benefits of antibiotics, seen in people with higher throat survey scores, have to be compared to side effects, effects on small organisms that live in or on the human body, the ability of bacteria to defeat the antibiotics designed to kill them, people more likely to seek medical care for future illness and costs. Preventing pus formation is not a reason for using antibiotics to help sore throat. If using antibiotics, taking penicillin V two to three times a day for 10 days is suggested. Currently, taking antibiotics for fewer than 10 days is not recommended."
17,30784327,"Introduction: In acute oral poisoning, any first aid intervention that limits or delays the uptake of the ingested substance, and which can be performed by bystanders as first responders, might assist in reducing morbidity if a toxic substance has been ingested. The current recommendation by the International Federation of Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies is to place a victim in the left lateral decubitus position. Conclusions: The identified studies provide evidence of very low certainty. However, based on the evidence that the left lateral decubitus position may be effective in decreasing the absorption of several drugs, the simplicity of the intervention and the generally low perceived risk of this intervention, the recommendation of the first aid guidelines of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies can remain unchanged.","In poisoning caused by swallowing a toxic substance once or many times over a short period of time, any first aid assistance that reduces or delays how much is swallowed, and which ones bystanders can do, might help in reducing illness. The International Federation of Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies recommends a victim be placed on the person's left side. We conclude that the studies provide unreliable results. However, based on studies that show placing a person on the person's left side may decrease absorption of many drugs, and the ease and low risk of doing so, the recommendation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies stands.",

Two hundred thirty-nine foreign bodies (98.8%) were successfully managed endoscopically. The surgery rate was 0.4%. There was no morbidity or mortality. Twenty-five percent of the cases were done under general endotracheal anesthesia. Coins in the esophagus are removed promptly if in the cervical or mid esophagus, and within 12 hours if in the distal esophagus. Once in the stomach, they will usually pass without difficulty. Meat impaction resulting in an obstructed esophagus is an urgent problem and the bolus should be removed within hours. Sharp and pointed foreign bodies can be very difficult to manage. Dry runs with a reproduction of the foreign body are essential to successful removal. Button batteries lodged in the esophagus represent an emergency and should be removed without delay.

42,29179736,"Background: While the genomes of eukaryotes and Archaea both encode the histone-fold domain, only eukaryotes encode the core histone paralogs H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. With DNA, these core histones assemble into the nucleosomal octamer underlying eukaryotic chromatin. Importantly, core histones for H2A and H3 are maintained as neofunctionalized paralogs adapted for general bulk chromatin (canonical H2 and H3) or specialized chromatin (H2A. Z enriched at gene promoters and cenH3s enriched at centromeres). In this context, the identification of core histone-like ""doublets"" in the cytoplasmic replication factories of the Marseilleviridae (MV) is a novel finding with possible relevance to understanding the origin of eukaryotic chromatin. Here, we analyze and compare the core histone doublet genes from all known MV genomes as well as other MV genes relevant to the origin of the eukaryotic replisome. Results: Using different phylogenetic approaches, we show that MV histone domains encode obligate H2B-H2A and H4-H3 dimers of possible proto-eukaryotic origin. MV core histone moieties form sister clades to each of the four eukaryotic clades of canonical and variant core histones. This suggests that MV core histone moieties diverged prior to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations associated with paired linear chromosomes and variant histone octamer assembly. We also show that MV genomes encode a proto-eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II enzyme that forms a sister clade to eukaryotes. This is a relevant finding given that DNA topo II influences histone deposition and chromatin compaction and is the second most abundant nuclear protein after histones. Conclusions: The combined domain architecture and phylogenomic analyses presented here suggest that a primitive origin for MV histone genes is a more parsimonious explanation than horizontal gene transfers + gene fusions + sufficient divergence to eliminate relatedness to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations within the H2A and H3 clades without loss of relatedness to each of the four core histone clades. We thus suggest MV histone doublet genes and their DNA topo II gene possibly were acquired from an organism with a chromatinized replisome that diverged prior to the origin of eukaryotic core histone variants for H2/H2A.Z and H3/cen H3. These results also imply that core histones were utilized ancestrally in viral DNA compaction and/or protection from host endonucleases.","While DNA of multi-celled and some one-celled organisms both encode a specific DNA-binding region, only multi-celled organisms encode the core proteins that DNA wraps around (core histones). With DNA, these core histones assemble into an 8-piece in the nucleus that binds DNA in multi-celled organisms. Importantly, certain core histones are kept as proteins capable of general-purpose or region-specific DNA-binding proteins. In this context, identifying core histone-like ""duplicates"" in the replication factories for the virus Marseilleviridae (MV) is a new finding with usefuleness to understanding the origin of chromosomes in multi-celled organisms (eukaryotes). Here, we analyze the core histone duplicate genes from all known MV genes and other MV genes related to the origin of the DNA replication site for multi-celled organisms. With different evolutionary approaches, we show that specific MV DNA-binding areas encode necessary histones of possible pre-eukaryotic origin. MV core histones form similar groups to each of the four eukaryotic groups of known and variant core histones. MV core histone groups may have divered before eukaryotic duplicate genes gained new functions (neofunctionalization) associated with paired linear chromosomes and variable histone group assembly. We also show that MV genes encode a pre-eukaryotic DNA replication enzyme that forms a sister group to eukaryotes. This is a useful finding since these DNA replication enzymes affect histone settlement and DNA compaction and is the second most common nuclear protein after histones. The combined region architecture and evolutionary analyses shown here suggest a primitive origin for MV histone genes is a tighter explanation than gene transfers + fusions + mutations to eliminate relatedenss to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations within histone groups without loss of relatedness to each of the four core histone sister groups. We thus suggest that MV histone doublet genes and their DNA replication gene were possible obtained from an organism with a specific DNA replication site that diverged before the origin of eukaryotic core histone variation. Core histones may have been used before in viral DNA compaction and protection from host proteins.","Eukaryotes are cells commonly identified by having a nucleus (chamber to hold DNA). Eukaryotes provide genetic instructions to the following histone proteins that are similar but not identical: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. With DNA, these core histones come together into the basic structural unit of DNA packaging called the nucleosomal octamer. Importantly, histones for H2A and H3 are maintained as genes that develop a new function and are applied for chromatin, a substance within a chromosome made up of DNA and protein. In this context, the identification of core histone-like genes in the fluid that fills cells in Marseilleviridae viruses is a new finding with possible importance to understanding the origin of eukaryotic chromatin. This study analyzes and compares core histone-like genes from the genes of all known Marseilleviridae viruses, as well as other Marseilleviridae genes relevant to the beginning of the eukaryotic DNA replication machine. Using different approaches, researchers show that Marseilleviridae histone provide genetic information to H2B-H2A and H4-H3 structures. Marseilleviridae core histones form similar copies to each of the four eukaryotic histone groups. This suggests that parts of the Marseilleviridae core histone changed before eukaryotes changed functions. Researchers also show that Marseilleviridae genes provide information to other enzymes that form organisms similar to eukaryotes. This is a relevant finding given that DNA unwinding enzymes influences histone structure and the folding of DNA and is the second most abundant nuclear protein after histones. In conclusion, an early origin for Marseilleviridae histone genes is a more limited explanation than gene transfers + gene fusions + enough changes to remove relatedness to eukaryotic changes in functions within the H2A and H3. It is suggested that Marseilleviridae histone genes and their DNA genes are possibly taken from an organism that can replicate DNA that diverged before the beginning of eukaryotic core histone types for H2/H2A.Z and H3/cen H3. These results also imply that core histones are used in viral DNA folding and/or protection from viral-degrading, host enzymes called endonucleases."
20,7852252,"Background: Although several studies have examined the long-term efficacy of antidepressants, relatively little attention has been paid to the management of relapses or recurrences during continued antidepressant treatment. This study examined whether depressed patients who had recovered and then relapsed on fluoxetine 20 mg/day would benefit from an increase in fluoxetine dose. Method: Eighteen patients who relapsed on fluoxetine 20 mg/day during long-term treatment with fluoxetine as part of a placebo-controlled study had their fluoxetine dose raised to 40 mg/day and were followed for at least 1 month (mean time = 4.7 months). Results: Twelve (67%) were full responders, 3 (17%) partial responders, and 3 (17%) dropped out because of side effects (e.g., insomnia and agitation). Of those patients who had either full or partial response (N = 15; 83%), 3 complete responders had a recurrence on 40 mg/day after a mean of 5.8 months and 1 partial responder had a recurrence 11 months later. Overall, 11 (61%) of 18 patients maintained their response during their follow-up while taking the higher dose of fluoxetine. Conclusion: An increase in dose of fluoxetine to 40 mg/day appears to be an effective strategy in the treatment of relapse among depressed patients who had initially responded to fluoxetine 20 mg/day.","Antidepressants are medications used to treat depression and other disorders and can improve mood, sleep quality, and concentration. Although several studies have examined how well antidepressants work long-term, there is little attention on how to manage relapses (the worsening of a medical condition that had previously improved) or recurrences (when symptoms return months or years after a person has recovered from the last episode) during continued use of antidepressant drugs. This study examined whether depressed patients who had recovered and then relapsed on fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) at 20 mg/day will benefit from an increase dose of fluoxetine. In this study, 18 patients who relapsed on fluoxetine 20 mg/day during long-term treatment with fluoxetine as part of a larger study had their fluoxetine dose raised to 40 mg/day and were followed for at least 1 month. Twelve (67%) were full responders (patients who reached the expected improvement), 3 (17%) partial responders (patients who reached only part of the expected improvement), and 3 (17%) dropped out of the study because of side effects (e.g. insomnia and agitation).

9,25328387,"Objective: In the present study, an attempt was made to examine the effects of aural stimulation with ointment containing capsaicin on swallowing function in order to develop a novel and safe treatment for non-obstructive dysphagia in elderly patients. Patients and methods: The present study included 26 elderly patients with non-obstructive dysphagia. Ointment containing 0.025% capsaicin (0.5 g) was applied to the external auditory canal with a cotton swab under otoscope only once or once a day for 7 days before swallowing of a bolus of colored water (3 mL), which was recorded by transnasal videoendoscopy and evaluated according to the endoscopic swallowing score. Results: After a single application of 0.025% capsaicin ointment to the right external auditory canal, the endoscopic swallowing score was significantly decreased, and this effect lasted for 60 minutes. After repeated applications of the ointment to each external auditory canal alternatively once a day for 7 days, the endoscopic swallowing score decreased significantly in patients with more severe non-obstructive dysphagia. Of the eight tube-fed patients of this group, three began direct swallowing exercises using jelly, which subsequently restored their oral food intake. Conclusion: These findings suggest that stimulation of the external auditory canal with ointment containing capsaicin improves swallowing function in elderly patients with non-obstructive dysphagia. By the same mechanism used by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to induce cough reflex, which has been shown to prevent aspiration pneumonia, aural stimulation with capsaicin may reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in dysphagia patients via Arnold's ear-cough reflex stimulation.","We looked at the effects of rubbing an ointment with capsaicin, found in different types of hot peppers, on the ears to improve swallowing function and create a new and safe treatment for old people who have the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage.

We used a Q-tip to put ointment with 0.025% capsaicin (0.5 g) in the ear only once or once a day for 7 days before drinking 3 mL of colored water, which was recorded using a flexible tube with a camera and rated using a common test that measures how well one swallows. After putting 0.025% capsaicin ointment to the right ear, the common swallowing test showed less difficulty swallowing. This effect lasted for one hour. After putting the ointment on alternating ears once a day for 7 days, the common swallowing test showed less difficulty swallowing in people with more serious sensations of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. Of the eight people fed with tubes in this group, three began direct swallowing exercises using jelly, which then returned their ability to eat food by mouth. We concluded that putting ointment with capsaicin on the ear improves swallowing function in old people who have the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. In the same way as other methods to stimulate the cough reflex, putting capsaicin on the ears may decrease how often people with difficulty swallowing develop pneumonia, caused by something entering the airway or lungs by accident, through a cough reflex stimulated by a nerve.",

28,34517257,"Background: Inflammation-mediated lung injury is a major cause of health problems in many countries and has been the leading cause of morbidity/mortality in intensive care units. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of the patients experienced serious pneumonia resulting from inflammation (Acute respiratory distress syndrome/ARDS). Pathogenic infections cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS) by hyperactivation of immune cells, which in turn release excessive cytokines causing ARDS. Currently, there are no standard therapies for viral, bacterial or pathogen-mediated CRS. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate and validate the protective effects of Dehydrozingerone (DHZ) against LPS induced lung cell injury by in-vitro and in-vivo models and to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that mediate these therapeutic effects. Methods: The therapeutic activity of DHZ was determined in in-vitro models by pre-treating the cells with DHZ and exposed to LPS to stimulate the inflammatory cascade of events. We analysed the effect of DHZ on LPS induced inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cell damage markers expression/levels using various cell lines. We performed gene expression, ELISA, and western blot analysis to elucidate the effect of DHZ on inflammation and its modulation of MAPK and NF-κB pathways. Further, the prophylactic and therapeutic effect of DHZ was evaluated against the LPS induced ARDS model in rats. Results: DHZ significantly (p < 0.01) attenuated the LPS induced ROS, inflammatory cytokine, chemokine gene expression and protein release in macrophages. Similarly, DHZ treatment protected the lung epithelial and endothelial cells by mitigating the LPS induced inflammatory events in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo analysis showed that DHZ treatment significantly (p < 0.001) mitigated the LPS induced ARDS pathophysiology of increase in the inflammatory cells in BALF, inflammatory cytokine and chemokines in lung tissues. LPS stimulated neutrophil-mediated events, apoptosis, alveolar wall thickening and alveolar inflammation were profoundly reduced by DHZ treatment in a rat model. Conclusion: This study demonstrates for the first time that DHZ has the potential to ameliorate LPS induced ARDS by inhibiting cytokine storm and oxidative through modulating the MAPK and NF-κB pathways. This data provides pre-clinical support to develop DHZ as a potential therapeutic agent against ARDS.","Lung injuries caused by inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) in the body is a major cause of health problems in several countries. Additionally, inflammation is a leading cause for disease and death within intensive care units (ICU) in hospitals. The majority of patients of COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related or respiratory disease) have suffered from a condition known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that results from inflammation. It is similar to pneumonia (lung infection). Infections within the body can trigger the excess release of cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that can tell your immune system what to do. Sometimes, when we are sick, cytokines stimulate too many immune cells, causing hyperactivation, which in turn causes more cytokines to release more signals. This causes a biological loop known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that results in ARDS. Currently, there are no medical treatments to prevent CRS that is causes by viruses, bacteria, or germs. The goal of this paper was to better understand how a chemical, known as Dehydrozingerone (DHZ), can protect lung cells from damage caused by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). LPS are molecules that exist within the cell walls of bacteria and are extremely toxic. This study used two types of studies, in vitro (in cells) and in vivo (in animals), to fully comprehend how DHZ can prevent LPS-induced lung cell injury. For the in vitro study, cells were treated with DHZ before being exposed to LPS. This caused a series of inflammatory events to occur within the treated cells. The authors reviewed how DHZ protected against LPS damage within several different types of cells. They performed several lab tests looking at cells' internal health to better determine the effect DHZ had on inflammation and how it was protective. Additionally, the authors determined how DHZ could prevent disease and protect against LPS within rats already sick with ARDS. Within one type of cell, DHZ significantly decreased the negative effects caused by LPS exposure. Similarly, DHZ protected lung cells by reducing LPS-induced inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. Meaning as the amount of DHZ given was increased, the symptoms from LPS treatment decreased. In the rats treated with DHZ, the chemical significantly reduced LPS-caused ARDS. DHZ significantly reduced several harmful effects of LPS within the rat model, including cell injury and cell death. This study is the first to show that DHZ has the ability to protect against ARDS by decreasing harmful immune responses triggered by LPS. This data provides support to develop DHZ as a potential human pharmaceutical prescription or drug to protect against ARDS.",
24,8095725,"The respiratory and behavioral effects of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) inverse agonist ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) were determined alone and in combination with buspirone, lorazepam, flumazenil, and SR 95195 in rhesus monkeys. For the respiratory studies, one group of monkeys inhaled either air or 5% CO2 mixed in air according to a fixed alternating schedule; respiratory frequency and minute volume were monitored. For the behavioral studies, another group of monkeys responded under a fixed-ratio (FR 30) schedule of food presentation. The respiratory stimulant effects of beta-CCE in both air and 5% CO2 were enhanced by prior treatment with the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) partial agonist buspirone (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) and a weak BZR inverse agonist, SR 95195 (10.0 mg/kg). Coadministration of buspirone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) also potentiated the rate-decreasing effects of beta-CCE under the FR schedule. The BZR agonist lorazepam (3.0 mg/kg) and BZR antagonist flumazenil (1.0 mg/kg) attenuated the effects of beta-CCE on respiratory frequency and minute volume particularly under the 5% CO2 condition, and lorazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) attenuated the effects of beta-CCE on FR responding. These latter results show that the respiratory and behavioral effects of beta-CCE in rhesus monkeys are at least in part due to effects at BZRs. Moreover, the findings suggest either that coactivation of benzodiazepine and 5-HT1A sites lead to a greater than additive effect or that beta-CCE and buspirone share a common mechanism of action that is unrelated to the receptor at which BZR inverse agonists act.","We studied effects on breathing and behavior of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR; a molecule that receives signals for a cell) inverse agonist (a drug that binds to the same receptor as an agonist or stimulating molecule but causes an opposite response) ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) alone and with the anxiety-reducing drugs of buspirone, lorazepam, flumazenil, and SR 95195 in monkeys. For the breathing-related studies, one group of monkeys breathed air or 5% CO2 mixed in air; breaths per minute and amount of gas breathed were measured. For the behavior studies, another group of monkeys responded to food given every thirty seconds. The increased breathing effects of beta-CCE in both air and 5% CO2 were increased by previously taking the drugs of 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A), partial agonist buspirone (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) and a weak BZR inverse agonist, SR 95195 (10.0 mg/kg). Taking buspirone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) at the same time also increased effects of beta-CCE under the food schedule. The BZR agonist lorazepam (3.0 mg/kg) and BZR antagonist flumazenil (1.0 mg/kg) reduced the effects of beta-CCE on breaths per minute and amount of gas breathed especially under the 5% CO2 condition. Lorazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) reduced the effects of beta-CCE on behavior responding on the food schedule. These latter results shows that effects on breathing and behavior of beta-CCE in monkeys are at least due to effects at BZRs. The results also suggest that benzodiazepine and 5-HT1A sites activated at the same time cause an effect greater than their individual effects or that beta-CCE and buspirone work similarly independent of the receptor where BZR inverse antagonists work.",

40,29981730,"Objectives: This study was conducted to determine hemodynamic and clinical tolerance under short-stretch compression therapy in elderly patients suffering from mixed-etiology leg ulcers. Design: Transversal observational study conducted in 25 hospitalized patients with a moderate peripheral arterial occlusive disease defined as an ankle-brachial pressure index>0.5, an ankle pressure of> 70mm Hg and a toe cuff pressure (TP)> 50mm Hg. Material and methods: Short-stretch bandages were applied daily with pressures from 20 to 30mm Hg. Ankle-brachial pressure, great toe laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) on dorsum of the foot were measured at baseline and after its removal at 24hours. Great toe LDF was also measured at 10minutes after bandage application. Compression pressure (CP) was measured with a sub-bandage device at baseline, at 10minutes and before bandage removal at 24hours. Clinical tolerance was evaluated taking into account the patient's pain and skin tolerance. Results: Mean age of patients was 80±15 years. Median duration of ulcers was 18 months. Hypertension was highly prevalent. One third of patients had diabetes. Toe pressure index and TcPO2 values did not significantly change under compression therapy (P=0.51 and P=0.09, respectively) whereas CP decreased significantly during 24hours. The loss of CP was significant 10minutes after bandage application (P<0.001). Nearly all ulcers were painful prior to placement of compression therapy and required level 1 analgesics. One patient required level 2 analgesic for pain relief. No increase in pain and no ischemic skin damage occurred under compression therapy. Conclusions: In elderly patients with mixed leg ulcers and with an absolute TP>50mm Hg, short-stretch compression of up to 30mm Hg does not adversely affect arterial flow and appears clinically well tolerated. Such bandages with appropriate levels of compression may aid ulcer healing by treating the venous part of the disease.","This study aimed to find blood flow and tolerance under less-stretchable compression treatment in elderly patients with mixed-cause leg sores or open wounds (leg ulcers). We studied 25 hospitalized patients with blocked blood vessels in the limbs. Less-stretchable compression bandages were applied daily. Ankle pressure, toe blood flow, and oxygen pressure at the skin on the top of the foot was measured at the start and after bandage removal at 24 hours. Big toe blood flow was measured 10 minutes after applying the bandage. Compression pressure was measured with a special device at the start, at 10 minutes, and before bandage removal at 24 hours. Patient tolerance was measured while considering the patient's pain and skin tolerance. Average age of patients was 80 years. Average duration of sores or open wounds was 18 months. High blood pressure was common. One third of patients had diabetes. Neither pressure nor oxygen to the toes changed with compression therapy, but compression pressure decreased over 24 hours. The compression pressure loss was noticeable 10 minutes after applying the bandage. Nearly all ulcers were painful before compression therapy and needed painkillers. One patient needed a more powerful pain killer. No increase in pain or blood-flow-related skin damage occured with compression. In elderly patients with mixed leg ulcers and sufficient toe pressure, less-stretchable compression does not negatively affect blood flow and appears tolerated. Bandages with appropriate compression may aid ulcer healing by treating the blood flow part of the disease.","The aim of this study was to determine how short-stretch compression therapy affected blood flow and clinical tolerance (how much a patient could take). The study was conducted in elderly patients suffering from leg ulcers (sores) caused by various reasons. This observational study was conducted in 25 hospitalized patients with moderate peripheral aterial occlusive disease, or limited blood flow to lower limbs. Short-stretch bandages were applied daily with pressures ranging from 20 to 30mm Hg. Several health measures were taken before the bandages were applied and after 24 hours. These measures include: ankle-brachial pressure, great toe laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) on top of the foot. LDF measures blood flow. TcPO2 measures oxygen in the skin. Great toe LDF was also measured at 10 minutes after bandage application. Compression pressure (CP) was measured before bandages were placed on, at 10 minutes, and before bandage removal at 24 hours. Clinical tolerance was evaluated taking into account the patient's pain and skin tolerance. The average age of patients was 80 ± 15 years. Median (average) duration of ulcers was 18 months. Hypertension (high blood pressure) was highly common. One third of patients had diabetes. Toe pressure index and TcPO2 values did not significantly change under compression therapy. CP decreased significantly during 24 hours. The loss of CP was significant 10 minutes after bandages were put on. Nearly all ulcers were painful prior to placement of compression therapy and required level 1 (minor) pain medication. One patient required level 2 (more intense) pain medication for pain relief. No increase in pain and no skin damage due to low blood flow occurred under compression therapy. The authors conclude that elderly patients with mixed leg ulcers using short-stretch compression did not have adversely (negatively) affected blood flow to the heart. The treatment was clinically well tolerated. Bandages with appropriate levels of compression may aid ulcer healing by treating the diseased veins."

More recently changes in circulating EFA metabolites (EFAM) together with EFAM hypo-responsiveness of immune cells and EFAM production from cells have been found associated with disease. We hypothesize that changes in ratio of EFAMs are the normal physiological responses to stressors, but when stressors are excessive or prolonged, EFAM systems may become unpredictably hypo-responsive owing to factors such as receptor down regulation and substrate depletion. In time, many homeostatic system become deranged and held in that state by minor stressors.

18,23251152,"Group 1 (All Types of CHO) The intervention followed the American Dietetic Association nutrition practice guidelines for gestational diabetes. Women received an individual food plan based on CHO restriction (40–45% of TEI), using a CHO counting strategy (basic level). Moderate energy restriction was recommended only for overweight and obese women (24 kcal/kg). Breakfast CHO intake was limited to 15–30 g, and adequate fiber intake was promoted (20–35 g/day). Women in this group were advised to choose any type of CHO, except added refined sugars. Energy and CHO prescriptions were revised at every visit and changes were done according to weight gain and whether or not ketonuria was present. If ketones were present and weight gain was subnormal, energy prescription was increased (200 to 300 kcal/day). If weight gain was adequate, energy was not modified and carbohydrates were increased (no more than 45% of TEI). Fat intake recommendation was maintained (<40% of TEI), and protein recommendation adjustment was made accordingly (20–25% of TEI). Group 2 (Low GI CHO) Women in this group received the same intervention as women in Group 1, but were counseled to eliminate all moderate and high GI foods (GI > 55). Tropical fruits, refined breads, breakfast cereals, flour tortilla, white rice, refined cookies and pastries, potatoes, carrots, beets, and refined sugars were eliminated from their plan. Papaya was the only moderate GI fruit permitted because it is one of the most frequently consumed high-fiber foods in this population. Corn tortillas were included only when combined with beans, as well as corn flakes combined with milk, according to some evidence that the combination of these foods decreases their GI. Conclusions. Inclusion of low GI CHO as part of a comprehensive nutrition intervention is equally effective in improving glycemic control as compared to all types of CHO. This strategy had a positive effect in preventing excessive maternal weight gain but increased the risk of prematurity.","Group 1 of a study included all types of carbohydrates and followed the guidelines described by the American Dietetic Association, an organization of food and nutrition professionals, for gestational diabetes, a type of high blood sugar (diabetes) that develops during pregnancy in women who do not already have diabetes. Women each receive a food plan based on limiting carbohydrates, using a method that counts carbohydrates. Limiting the amount of calories and foods that generate energy consumed is recommend only for overweight or obese women. Breakfast carbohydrates eaten is limited, and adequate fiber consumed is increased. Women in this group are advised to choose any type of carbohydrate, except those with added refined sugars (processed sugars added to food). Energy and carbohydrate prescriptions are revised at every visit, and changes are done according to weight gain and whether or not ketonuria (high ketones, which is a chemical made in the liver that helps break down fat, in urine) is present. If ketones are present and weight gain is under the normal level, energy prescription is increased. If weight gain is enough, energy is not modified, and carbohydrates are increased. The recommendation for the amount of fat eaten stays the same, and the protein recommendation is adjusted accordingly. Group 2 focused on carbohydrates with a low glycemic index (a rating system used to measure how much specific foods increase blood sugar levels). Women in this group have the same program as women in Group 1, but are guided to remove all moderate and high glycemic index foods. Tropical fruits, refined (highly processed) breads, breakfast cereals, flour tortilla, white rice, refined cookies and pastries, potatoes, carrots, beets, and refined sugars are eliminated from their plan. Papaya was the only moderate glycemic index fruit permitted because it is one of the most frequently consumed high-fiber foods in this population. Corn tortillas are included only when combined with beans, as well as corn flakes combined with milk, based on some evidence that the combination of these foods decreases their glycemic index. In conclusion, including low glycemic index carbohydrates as part of a well-rounded nutrition program is just as effective in improving glycemic control as compared to all types of carbohydrates. This strategy has a positive effect in preventing too much maternal weight gain but increases the risk of prematurity (a baby born before 37 weeks).",
47,28401263,"A majority of adults with persistently low serum alkaline phosphatase values carry a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in the ALPL gene and also have elevated alkaline phosphatase substrate values in serum and urine. These adults may fall within the spectrum of the adult form of hypophosphatasia. Introduction: The primary objective of this study was to determine what proportion of adults with persistently low serum alkaline phosphatase values (hypophosphatasemia) harbor mutations in the ALPL gene or have elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) substrates. Some adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia share clinical and radiographic features with the adult form of hypophosphatasia (HPP). In HPP, ALPL mutations result in persistent hypophosphatasemia and ALP substrate accumulation in plasma (pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)) and urine (phosphoethanolamine (PEA)). Methods: Biochemical analyses, including serum ALP activity, bone-specific ALP, plasma PLP, and urine PEA, were performed in adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia. Mutational analyses were performed using PCR and Sanger sequencing methods. Gene variants were classified as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign (LB), and benign (B). P and LP variants were further grouped as ""Positive ALPL variants"" and LB and B grouped as ""Negative ALPL variants."" Results: Fifty subjects completed all mutational and biochemical analyses. Sixteen percent carried only Negative ALPL variants. Of the remaining 42 subjects, 67% were heterozygous for a P variant, 19% for an LP variant, and 14% for a VUS. Biochemical results were highly inter-correlated and consistent with the expected inverse relationship between ALP and its substrates. Subjects harboring Positive ALPL variants showed lower ALP and BSAP and higher PLP and PEA values compared with subjects harboring only Negative ALPL variants. Approximately half of all subjects harboring Positive ALPL variants or ALPL VUS showed elevations in plasma PLP, and three quarters showed elevations in urine PEA. Conclusion: Adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia frequently harbor ALPL mutations and have elevated ALP substrates. These adults may fall within the spectrum of the adult form of hypophosphatasia. Clinicians should take note of persistent hypophosphatasemia in their patients and be cautious in prescribing bisphosphonates when present.

These adults also most likely have elevated alkaline phosphatase substrate values in serum and urine. Alkaline phosphatase can indicate bone health. These adults may suffer from the adult form of hypophosphatasia, an inherited disorder that affects bone and tooth development. The aim of this study was to determine what proportion of adults with hypophosphatasemia (low serum alkaline phosphatase) also have ALPL gene mutations or elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) substrates. Some adults with hypophosphatasemia share observable or radiographic (seen through x-ray) features with the adult form of hypophosphatasia (HPP). In HPP, ALPL mutations cause persistent hypophosphatasemia and ALP substrate (protein) accumulation in plasma (pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)) and urine (phosphoethanolamine (PEA)). Analyses of compounds from biological samples, including serum ALP activity, bone-specific ALP, plasma PLP, and urine PEA, were performed in adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia. Analysis to determine ALPL mutations were performed. Variations of the gene ALPL were classified as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign (LB), and benign (B). Pathogenic mutations often make a person more susceptible to disease. Benign mutations do not affect human health. P and LP variants were further grouped as ""Positive ALPL variants"" and LB and B grouped as ""Negative ALPL variants."" A total of 50 subjects completed all mutational and biochemical analyses. Sixteen percent carried only Negative ALPL variants. Of the remaining 42 subjects, 67% were heterozygous for a P variant, 19% for an LP variant, and 14% for a VUS. Biochemical results were associated with the inverse (opposite) relationship between ALP and its substrates. Subjects harboring Positive ALPL variants had lower ALP and BSAP and higher PLP and PEA values. Approximately half of all subjects harboring Positive ALPL variants or ALPL VUS showed elevations in plasma PLP. Most also showed elevations in urine PEA. Adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia often have ALPL mutations and have elevated ALP substrates. These adults may fall within the spectrum of the adult form of hypophosphatasia. Clinicians should note long-lasting hypophosphatasia in patients and be cautious in giving them anit-bone-breakdown drugs.","Many adults with persistently low blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, a protein that influences levels of the high-energy molecule phosphate, possibly have a mutation in the ALPL gene that encodes alkaline phosphatase. Many adults also have increased phosphate-carrying compounds in blood and urine. These adults may have low blood phosphate levels (hypophosphatasia). The study determines what proportion of adults with persistently low blood alkaline phosphatase levels (hypophosphatasemia) have mutations in the ALPL gene or accumulated phosphate-carrying compounds. Some adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia share symptoms with the adult form of low blood phosphate levels or hypophosphatasia (HPP). In HPP, ALPL mutations lead to persistent hypophosphatasemia and phosphate-carrying compounds in blood (pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) or active vitamin B6) and urine (phosphoethanolamine (PEA) or a key molecule to build cell boundaries). Blood ALP activity, bone-specific ALP, blood PLP, and urine PEA were measured in adults with persistently low levels of ALP. Variations of the ALPL gene were classified as disease-causing or pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely harmless or benign (LB), and benign (B). P and LP variants were also grouped as ""Positive ALPL variants"". LB and B were grouped as ""Negative ALPL variants."" Fifty subjects completed all the tests. Sixteen percent had only Negative ALPL variatns. Of the remaining 42, 67% had at least one copy of the P variant, 19% for an LP variant, and 14% for a VUS. Tests results agreed with each other and showed that the amount of ALP trended oppositely with the quantity of the molecules that it acts upon. Those with Positive ALPL variants had lower ALP and bone-specific ALP and had higher PLP and PEA than those with Negative ALPL variants. Around half of those with Positive ALPL variants or ALPL VUS had increases in blood PLP. Three quarters had increases in urine PEA.

36,34540217,"Introduction: We determine the effect of patient characteristics (age, sex, and body mass index BMI) and stone characteristics (density, location, and size) by non-contrast computed tomography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (CT-KUB) in predicting the success of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in the treatment of kidney and ureteric stones. We present this study to further enrich the knowledge of physicians towards the effect of different patient characteristics upon predicting extra-corporal shock wave lithotripsy success rates. Methods: We evaluated 155 patients who received ESWL for renal and ureteric stone measuring 3-20 mm (mm), over a 3-month period. The stone size in millimeters, density in Hounsfield units (HU) and its location was determined on pre-treatment CT-KUB. ESWL was successful if post-treatment residual renal stone fragments were ≤3 mm and for ureteric stones should be totally cleared. Results: The overall success of ESWL treatment was observed in 65.8% of the 155 patients. There was no significant difference seen when the effect of patients age, sex and BMI were studied with ESWL outcome with P values were 0.155, 0.101 and 0.415 respectively. Also, stone location either in the kidney or ureter has no statistically significant effect on ESWL response rate. while stone density and size determined on CT KUB have statistically significant effect on the success rate of ESWL with a P-value of 0.002 and 0.000 respectively. Conclusions: This study shows that determination of stone density and stone size on CT KUB pre ESWL can help to predict the outcome of ESWL. We propose that stone density <500 HU and stone size < 5 mm are highly likely to result in successful ESWL.","Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a procedure to break up stones in the body by using shock waves and an X-ray to target the stones. Researchers search for the effects of patient characteristics (age, sex, and body mass index or BMI) and stone characteristics (density, location, and size) on how successful ESWL procedure is on stones in the kidneys, ureters (tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder), and bladder. This study is intended to increase the knowledge of doctors on the effect of different patient characteristics on predicting how successful using extra-corporal shock wave lithotripsy is. Researchers evaluate 155 patients who receive ESWL for stones in the kidney and ureter (tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) over a 3-month period. The stone size in millimeters (mm), density, and its location is determined using an x-ray scan before patients received treatment. ESWL is considered to be successful if the size of remaining kidney stone fragments after the procedure are ≤3 mm and if ureteric stones are totally cleared. The overall success of ESWL treatment was observed in 65.8% of the 155 patients. There is no major difference seen when the effect of age, sex, and BMI of patients are studied with ESWL outcomes. Also, stone location either in the kidney or ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) has no statistically significant effect (not likely to happen randomly or by chance) on the success of ESWL. Stone density and size based on the scanned images have a statistically significant effect on the success rate of ESWL. In conclusion, this study shows that finding out the density and size of stones using a scanned x-ray image before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) can help predict the outcome of ESWL. Researchers of this study suggest that low stone density and size are highly likely to result in successful ESWL.",
41,33549515,"DNA damage and alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) signaling could be one of the molecular mechanisms mediating focal kidney cyst formation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that markers of DNA damage and DDR signaling are increased in human and experimental ADPKD. In the human ADPKD transcriptome, the number of up-regulated DDR-related genes was increased by 16.6-fold compared with that in normal kidney, and by 2.5-fold in cystic compared with that in minimally cystic tissue (P < 0.0001). In end-stage human ADPKD tissue, γ-H2A histone family member X (H2AX), phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia and radiation-sensitive mutant 3 (Rad3)-related (pATR), and phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM) localized to cystic kidney epithelial cells. In vitro, pATR and pATM were also constitutively increased in human ADPKD tubular cells (WT 9-7 and 9-12) compared with control (HK-2). In addition, extrinsic oxidative DNA damage by hydrogen peroxide augmented γ-H2AX and cell survival in human ADPKD cells, and exacerbated cyst growth in the three-dimensional Madin-Darby canine kidney cyst model. In contrast, DDR-related gene expression was only transiently increased on postnatal day 0 in Pkd1RC/RC mice, and not altered at later time points up to 12 months of age. In conclusion, DDR signaling is dysregulated in human ADPKD and during the early phases of murine ADPKD. The constitutive expression of the DDR pathway in ADPKD may promote survival of PKD1-mutated cells and contribute to kidney cyst growth.","Damage to DNA and changes to the body's response to DNA damage, called DNA damage response or DDR, could be one of the processes involved in the development of kidney cysts (growths) in the inherited disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This study aims to test the idea that certain types of DNA damage and DDR signaling are increased in ADPKD experiments. In the part of the human ADPKD genes that transfer information to molecules, the DNA damage response (DDR) genes increased 16 times compared with that in a normal kidney. DDR also more than doubled in tissues with cysts compared to DDR in tissues with few cysts. In tissues from end-stage human ADPKD, certain genes and protein enzymes involved in the DDR to detect and repair damaged DNA focus on cystic kidney epithelial cells, which are important cells for kidney function. In lab tests, protein enzymes are also increased in human ADPKD cells located in the tubal duct system of the kidneys when compared with normal tubal cells. Additionally, some DNA damage increases genes and cell survival in human ADPKD cells, and worsens cyst growth in one animal experiment. In contrast, DNA damage response (DDR) gene processing is only temporarily increased on the day of birth in mice, and not altered at later times up to 12 months of age. In conclusion, DDR signals to other cells are not controlled well in human ADPKD and during the early phases of animal ADPKD. The use of the DNA damage response in ADPKD may promote survival of gene cells that have mutated (changed) and contribute to cyst growth in the kidneys.",

However, beta-blockers are also known as drugs with an antiarrhythmic effect due to the suppression of sympathetic activity. We evaluated the antiarrhythmic effects of a highly selective beta(1)-blocker, bisoprolol, in patients with diurnal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P-AF). A total of 136 patients with symptomatic diurnal P-AF were enrolled. Patients were divided into a diurnal-specific P-AF group and a diurnal & nocturnal P-AF group, as well as into a bisoprolol single use group and a combined use group with an antiarrhythmic drug. The effects of bisoprolol were evaluated in 3 categories: subjective symptom improvement, quality of life (QOL) improvement, and elimination of P-AF episode in Holter electrocardiograms (ECGs). For patients with effective treatment, a long-term effect up to 24 months was evaluated. Five patients (3.7%) discontinued bisoprolol due to side effects. Following administration of bisoprolol, 109 patients (80%) experienced subjective symptom improvement, 103 patients (76%) experienced QOL improvement, and elimination of P-AF episodes in ECGs was observed in 84 patients (62%). The elimination rate of P-AF episodes in ECGs was higher in the diurnal P-AF group than in the diurnal & nocturnal P-AF group (P=0.042). There was no significant difference between the bisoprolol single use group and the combined use group. A long-term suppressive effect by bisoprolol was observed in 70 of 83 patients (84%). The results demonstrate that bisoprolol has an antiarrhythmic effect against sympathetic diurnal P-AF, improving subjective symptoms and QOL and eliminating P-AF episodes in ECGs.","In the treatment of arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat), beta-blockers (medications that reduce blood pressure) are mainly used to regulate the heart rate. However, beta-blockers are also known as drugs with an antiarrhythmic effect (drugs that slow down the electrical impulses of the heart) due to the suppression of sympathetic activity (the part of the nervous system that increases heart rate, blood pressure, and other heart functions). Researchers evaluated how electrical impulses of the heart are slowed down when using a beta-blocker called bisoprolol in patients with diurnal (during the day) paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rate that returns to normal within 7 days on its own or with treatment). A total of 136 patients with symptomatic daytime paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P-AF) were included in the study. Patients were divided into a daytime P-AF or a daytime and nighttime P-AF group, as well as into a group that only uses bisoproplol and a group that uses a combination of heart treatment drugs. The effects of bisoprolol are evaluated in 3 categories: symptom improvement, quality of life improvement, and elimination of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P-AF) events, which are measured using a portable device called Holter electrocardiograms (ECGs) to record heart rhythms. For patients with effective treatment, a long-term effect up to 24 months was evaluated. Five patients stopped using bisoprolol due to side effects. Following use of bisoprolol, 80% experienced symptom improvement, 76% experienced quality of life improvement, and elimination of P-AF episodes in ECGs was observed in 62%. The elimination rate of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation episodes in ECGs was higher in the daytime group than in the daytime and nighttime group. There was no significant difference between the group that only used bisoprolol and the combined use group. A long-term effect of reducing P-AF using bisoprolol was found in 84% of patients. This study shows that bisoprolol can slow down the electrical impulses of the heart in daytime paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, improve symptoms and quality of life, and eliminate paroxysmal atrial fibrillation episodes in ECGs.","To treat irregular heart beats, beta-blockers (drugs that reduce blood pressure) are used to regulate heart rate. However, beta-blockers also prevent irregular heart beats due to the reduction of nerve-related, stimulating activity. We measured the irregular-heart-beat-preventing effects of a highly specific drug that reduces blood pressure, bisoprolol, in patients with daily paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P-AF), which involves sudden occurences of an irregular or rapid heart beat. 136 patients with typical daily P-AF were employed. Patients were divided into a group with daily-specific P-AF and a daily and nightly P-AF group. Patients were also divided into a group with single use of bisoprlol and a combined use group with an drug that prevents an irregular heart beat. For patients with treatment, a long-term effect up to 24 months was measured. Five patients (3.7%) stopped bisoprolol due to side effects. After using a drug that reduces blood pressure, 109 patients (80%) had personal improvement, and 103 pateints (76%) had quality-of-life improvement. Elimination of sudden occurences of an irregular heart beat was measured in 84 patients (62%). The elimination rate of episodes of P-AF was higher in the daily P-AF group than in the daily and nightly P-AF group. There was no difference between the group with single use of bisoprolol and the combined use group. The long-term effect of bisoprolol was seen in 70 of 83 patients (84%). Bisoprolol helps prevent an irregular heart beat against nerve-related, sudden episodes of an irregular heart beat, improving personal symptoms and eliminating episodes."
48,34618348,"Introduction: Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) selectively restores disturbances of regulatory T cells (Treg) and conventional T cells, resulting in the induction of remission in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. However, to date no research has been carried out on the efficacy of low-dose IL-2 in the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis (LN). The aim of the study reported here was to investigate the renal response to low-dose IL-2 in patients with refractory LN. Methods: The study population comprised ten patients with refractory LN who failed to achieve complete response or who had relapsed while being treated with at least two conventional immunosuppressive agents. One treatment cycle consisted of IL-2 at a dose of 1 million IU administered subcutaneously every other day for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week break. All patients received three cycles of IL-2 and were then followed up for another 12 weeks without any increase in the dose of previous immunosuppressive agents and steroids. Results: Of the ten patients enrolled in the study, seven (70%) achieved ≥ 50% improvement in proteinuria at 12 weeks after initiating treatment with IL-2. Median proteinuria was significantly reduced by 50.3% at week 12, from 1.83 (interquartile range [IQR] 1.23-3.21) g/24 h at baseline to 0.91 (IQR 0.52-1.60) g/24 h at 12 weeks (P = 0.005). This was accompanied by a 71% reduction in urine erythrocytes, from 64/µl (IQR 24-102/µl) at baseline to 18/µl (IQR 2-20/µl) at 12 weeks (P = 0.018). Anti-ds DNA was decreased from 27.9 (IQR 7.6-40.28) IU/ml at baseline to 14.1 (IQR 7.3-20.12) IU/ml (P = 0.021) at week 12, while complements C3 and C4 were slightly increased (P = 0.445, P = 0.241, respectively). A significant expansion of Treg cells, from 9.3% at baseline to 16.6% at 12 weeks, was also found (P < 0.05). No serious adverse events occurred during the treatment period. Conclusions: Low-dose IL-2 therapy may have a promising role in the treatment of refractory LN as an alternative and safe therapeutic approach. It may be used as multi-target combination therapy in clinical practice.","Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a type of protein that promotes and develops immune cells at the start of an immune response and keeps them alive. A low-dose of interleukin-2 can restore changes of immune cells called T cells and Treg cells, resulting in the start of remission (recovery) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells). However, to date, no research has been carried out on the effectiveness of low-dose IL-2 in the treatment of lupus nephritis, a type of kidney disease caused by lupus. The aim of this study is to investigate the kidney response to low-dose IL-2 in patients with lupus nephritis that is not responding to standard treatment. The study includes 10 patients with lupus nephritis who failed to achieve a complete response to standard treatment or who improved and then worsened while being treated with at least two standard treatments. One treatment cycle consists of IL-2 given by an injection every other day for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week break. All patients receive three cycles of IL-2 and are then followed up for another 12 weeks without any increase in the dose of the previous treatments or steroids. Of the 10 patients enrolled in the study, 7 (70%) achieved 50% or more improvement in proteinuria (elevated levels of protein in the urine) at 12 weeks after starting IL-2 treatment. Average proteinuria is significantly reduced by 50.3% at week 12. There is also a 71% decrease in red blood cells in urine at 12 weeks. An antibody (infection-fighting molecule) associated with lupus called anti-ds DNA decreased from the start of the study to week 12, while protein complements C3 and C4 used to monitor the immune systems are slightly increased. A significant expansion of the immune Treg cells, from 9.3% at the start of the study to 16.6% at 12 weeks, is also found. No serious negative events occurred while patients receive the treatment. In conclusion, low-dose IL-2 therapy may have a promising role in the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis as an alternative and safe treatment approach. Low-dose IL-2 may be used in combination with other medicines in clinical practice.",
35,29946735,"Importance: By 2020, approximately 12.3 million individuals in the United States older than 50 years are expected to have osteoporosis. Osteoporotic fractures, particularly hip fractures, are associated with limitations in ambulation, chronic pain and disability, loss of independence, and decreased quality of life, and 21% to 30% of patients who experience a hip fracture die within 1 year. The prevalence of primary osteoporosis (ie, osteoporosis without underlying disease) increases with age and differs by race/ethnicity. With the aging of the US population, the potential preventable burden is likely to increase in future years. Objective: To update the 2011 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for osteoporosis. Evidence review: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for and treatment of osteoporotic fractures in men and women, as well as risk assessment tools, screening intervals, and efficacy of screening and treatment in subgroups. The screening population was postmenopausal women and older men with no known previous osteoporotic fractures and no known comorbid conditions or medication use associated with secondary osteoporosis. Findings: The USPSTF found convincing evidence that bone measurement tests are accurate for detecting osteoporosis and predicting osteoporotic fractures in women and men. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that clinical risk assessment tools are moderately accurate in identifying risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that drug therapies reduce subsequent fracture rates in postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found that the evidence is inadequate to assess the effectiveness of drug therapies in reducing subsequent fracture rates in men without previous fractures. Conclusions and recommendation: The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years and older. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years at increased risk of osteoporosis, as determined by a formal clinical risk assessment tool. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men. (I statement).","By 2020, about 12.3 million people in the United States older than 50 years are expected to have osteoporosis, a condition in which bones become weak and brittle. Broken bones from osteoporosis, especially hip breaks, are related to a limited ability to walk, long-term pain and disability, loss of independence, and reduced quality of life. 21% to 30% of people who break a hip die within 1 year. The number of people during a specific period with primary osteoporosis (i.e., osteoporosis not resulting from other disease), goes up with age and changes depending on race/ethnicity. With the U.S. population getting older, the possible cost of preventable disease is expected to go up in the future. We aim to update a 2011 expert panel suggestion on checking for osteoporosis. The expert panel looked at scientific studies on checking for and treatment of bone breaks due to osteoporosis in men and women, and tools to measure risk, periods between checks, and how well checks and treatment work in smaller groups. The group that was checked for osteoporosis was women who had gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) and older men who had never had a known bone break due to osteoporosis and no known conditions or drug use known to cause osteoporosis. The expert panel found strong proof that bone measurement tests are correct for finding osteoporosis and predicting bone breaks due to osteoporosis in women and men. The expert panel found some proof that tools to measure risk are somewhat correct in finding risk of osteoporosis and bone breaks due to osteoporosis. The expert panel found strong proof that drugs decrease later bone break rates in women who have gone through menopause. The expert panel found there is not enough proof to measure how well drugs work to decrease later bone break rates in men without previous bone breaks. The expert panel suggests checking for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent bone breaks from osteoporosis in women 65 years and older. The expert panel suggests checking for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent bone breaks from osteoporosis in women younger than 65 years who have gone through menopause who have a greater risk of osteoporosis, as decided by a tool used by doctors to measure risk. The expert panel concludes there is not enough data to measure the pros versus cons of checking for osteoporosis to prevent bone breaks from osteoporosis in men. ",
6,25251231,"Thyroiditis is a general term that encompasses several clinical disorders characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most common is Hashimoto thyroiditis; patients typically present with a nontender goiter, hypothyroidism, and an elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody level. Treatment with levothyroxine ameliorates the hypothyroidism and may reduce goiter size. Postpartum thyroiditis (occurring within one year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion) can be short-lived or long-lasting. Release of preformed thyroid hormone into the bloodstream may result in hyperthyroidism. This may be followed by transient or permanent hypothyroidism as a result of depletion of thyroid hormone stores and destruction of thyroid hormone-producing cells. Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function. Beta blockers can treat symptoms in the initial hyperthyroid phase; in the subsequent hypothyroid phase, levothyroxine should be considered in women with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 mIU per L, or in women with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 4 to 10 mIU per L who are symptomatic or desire fertility. Subacute thyroiditis is a transient thyrotoxic state characterized by anterior neck pain, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, and low radioactive iodine uptake on thyroid scanning. Many cases of subacute thyroiditis follow an upper respiratory viral illness, which is thought to trigger an inflammatory destruction of thyroid follicles. In most cases, the thyroid gland spontaneously resumes normal thyroid hormone production after several months. Treatment with high-dose acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is directed toward relief of thyroid pain.","Thyroiditis refers to medical conditions that include thyroid inflammation. The most common type of thyroiditis is Hashimoto thyroiditis. Patients usually have a painless enlarged thyroid, underactive thyroid, and high levels of proteins made by the immune system to fight foreign substances. Taking levothyroxine, a thyroid drug, improves underactive thyroid and may decrease thyroid size. Short-lived or long-lasting thyroiditis can occur postpartum, within one year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion. Overactive thyroid can be caused by stored thyroid hormone released to the blood. Overactive thyroid may be followed by short-term or permanent underactive thyroid. Patients should be checked for changes in thyroid function. Beta blockers can improve overactive thyroid symptoms. Levothyroxine, a thyroid drug, can improve underactive thyroid symptoms in women with high blood levels of hormones that act as a messenger to the thyroid. Subacute thyroiditis is short-lived and characterized by neck pain, low blood levels of hormones that acts as a messenger to the thyroid, and low thyroid function based on a common test. Many subacute thyroiditis cases follow colds. The thyroid usually returns to normal on its own after many months. High-dose aspirin or similar over-the-counter pain relievers can be taken to relieve thyroid pain.","Thyroiditis covers multiple disorders represented by inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most common disorder is Hashimoto thyroiditis. Patients have enlarged thyroids, reduced thyroid function, and increased proteins targeting thyroid products. Levothyroxine (a thyroid hormone treatment) improves thyroid function and size. Post-birth thyroiditis is temporary or lasting thyroid dysfunction occuring within a year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion. Supplemental thyroid hormone release into the blood may cause excess thyroid function. Temporary or permanent reduced thryoid function may follow excess thyroid function due to thyroid hormone depletion and destruction of hormone-producing cells. Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function. Beta blockers (common high blood pressure medication) can treat symptoms of the initial phase of excess thyroid function. Levothyroxine should be considered for later phases in women with high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Subacute or fairly rapid thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation) is a temporary, thyroid-hormone-excess state with frontal neck pain, reduced thyroid-stimulating hormone, and low iodine sensitivity. Fairly rapid thyroiditis often follows an upper airway viral illness, thought to trigger inflammatory destruction of thyroid cells. In most cases, the thyroid gland suddenly returns to normal after several months. High-dose aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help give thyroid pain relief."

Although the peak incidence for the disease occurs before 17 years of age, normal values for insulin secretion were not available in this age group. We performed a simplified intravenous glucose tolerance test in 167 normal children, and in 98 islet cell antibody (ICA)-negative and 12 ICA-positive siblings of diabetic patients. Their age range was 1-16 yr. The first phase of insulin secretion, evaluated as the sum of plasma insulin concentrations at 1 and 3 min, increased with age and was significantly lower in ICA-negative siblings (86 +/- 6 microU/ml, P < 0.002) than in normal controls (115 +/- 6 microU/ml). This difference was not apparent before 8 yr of age. None of the ICA-negative siblings developed diabetes after an average of 4.5 yr. ICA-positive siblings at first study had a first phase insulin response similar to that of ICA negative siblings, but significantly lower than that of the normal controls (74 +/- 13 microU/ml, P < 0.02).

Herein, we report clinical experience regarding efficacy and safety from all patients receiving BTZ as therapy for SLE in Sweden during the years 2014-2020. 8 females and 4 males were included with a mean disease duration at BTZ initiation of 8.8 years (range 0.7-20 years). Renal involvement was the main target for BTZ. Reduction of global disease activity was recorded by decreasing SLEDAI-2K scores over time and remained significantly reduced at the 6-month (p=0.007) and the 12-month (p=0.008) follow-up visits. From BTZ initiation, complement protein 3 (C3) levels increased significantly after the 2nd treatment cycle (p=0.05), the 6-month (p=0.03) and the 12-month (p=0.04) follow-up visits. The urine albumin/creatinine ratio declined over time and reached significance at the 6-month (p=0.008) and the 12-month follow-up visits (p=0.004).

Safety parameters (C-reactive protein, blood cell counts) mainly remained stable over time. To conclude, we report favorable therapeutic effects of BTZ used in combination with corticosteroids in a majority of patients with severe SLE manifestations irresponsive to conventional immunosuppressive agents. Reduction of proteinuria was observed over time as well as seroconversion of some autoantibody specificities. In most patients, tolerance was acceptable but mild adverse events was not uncommon.

We review multiple environmental, biologic and sociologic factors that may be important in the development of asthma. Meta-analyses of studies have demonstrated that multifaceted interventions are required in order to develop asthma prevention. Multifaceted allergen reduction studies have shown clinical benefits. Asthma represents a dysfunctional interaction with our genes and the environment to which they are exposed, especially in fetal and early infant life. The increasing prevalence of asthma also may be an indication of increased population risk for the development of other chronic non-communicable autoimmune diseases. This review will focus on the factors which may be important in the primary prevention of asthma. Better understanding of the complex gene-environment interactions involved in the development of asthma will provide insight into personalized interventions for asthma prevention.","Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and, in the latter part of the 20th century, asthma became very widespread. Asthma is generally believed to result from gene-environment interactions, which is when two different genes respond to something in the environment in different ways. There is agreement that there are certain times during pregnancy and early in a child's life when environmental factors (such as food, pollutants, temperature) may shape asthma's development. Researchers reviewed multiple environmental, biologic (such as brain chemistry, genes, nutrition, gender, and hormone levels) and sociologic (such as education and socioeconomic) factors that may be important in the development of asthma. Other studies show that multiple steps and actions are required to prevent asthma. Studies that focus on reducing or avoiding allergens (any substance that causes an allergic reaction) are beneficial. Asthma represents an error in how our genes and the environment interact, especially during pregnancy and early infant life. The increase in the number of asthma cases may also signal an increased risk in the general population for the development of other chronic autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks healthy cells.

33,10219274,"Purpose: This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of age, age-related changes in renal function, and gender on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of orally administered gabapentin (GBP). Methods: The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg oral dose of GBP were studied in 36 healthy subjects (18 men and 18 women) aged 20-78 years. Serial blood samples and total urine output were collected for 48 h after the dose. GBP concentrations in plasma and urine were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental methods. Results: All subjects tolerated the drug well, with only mild symptoms reported. No change in maximal GBP plasma concentration (Cmax), time at which Cmax occurred (tmax), or apparent volume of distribution (V/F) with age was noted. A significant linear decline in apparent oral clearance (CL/F), elimination-rate constant (lambda z), and renal clearance (CLR) with increasing age was observed (p < 0.005). Because total urinary recovery of unchanged drug (an estimate of F for GBP) did not change with age, the decline in CL/F and lambda z can be explained by the decline in CLR. The only pharmacokinetic parameter that was significantly different between genders was Cmax, which was approximately 25% higher for women than for men (p = 0.016), consistent with gender differences in body size. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that changes in renal function are responsible for age-related changes in GBP pharmacokinetics. Reduction of GBP dosage may be required in elderly patients with reduced renal function. The pharmacokinetics of GBP are similar in men and women.","This study is conducted to evaluate the effect of age, age-related changes in renal or kidney function, and gender on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (or drug activity) of orally (by mouth) administered gabapentin (GBP). The body's process of absorbing, distributing, using, and removing a single oral dose (by mouth) of gabapentin is studied in 36 healthy patients (18 men and 18 women) aged 20-78 years. Blood and urine samples are continuously collected for 48 hours after the dose of gabapentin. The amount of Gabapentin in plasma (or blood) and urine samples are measured, and other tests are done to understand how the body processes gabapentin. All patients are able to handle the drug well, with only mild symptoms reported. No change in the highest (peak) gabapentin amount, the time at which the highest gabapentin amount occurred, or apparent volume of distribution (the ability of various drugs to distribute through the body fluids) with age was noted. A major decline in clearance of gabapentin that is taken orally, the rate of removal from the body, and clearing it through the kidneys with increasing age is observed. The decline of oral clearance and rate of removal of gabapentin from the body can be explained by the decline in clearance by the kidneys. The only measure that is very different between genders is the highest (peak) gabapentin amount, which is approximately 25% higher for women than for men, consistent with gender differences in body size. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that changes in kidney function are responsible for age-related changes in how the body processes gabapentin. Giving a lesser dose of gabapentin may be required in elderly patients who have weaker kidney functions. How the body processes gabapentin is similar in men and women.",

29,32911778,"The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus has caused shock waves in many countries, producing a global health crisis worldwide. Lack of knowledge of the biological mechanisms of viruses, plus the absence of effective treatments against the disease (COVID-19) and/or vaccines have pulled factors that can compromise the proper functioning of the immune system to fight against infectious diseases into the spotlight. The optimal status of specific nutrients is considered crucial to keeping immune components within their normal activity, helping to avoid and overcome infections. Specifically, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated and deems six vitamins (D, A, C, Folate, B6, B12) and four minerals (zinc, iron, copper and selenium) to be essential for the normal functioning of the immune system, due to the scientific evidence collected so far. In this report, an update on the evidence of the contribution of nutritional factors as immune-enhancing aspects, factors that could reduce their bioavailability, and the role of the optimal status of these nutrients within the COVID-19 pandemic context was carried out. First, a non-systematic review of the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of an optimal nutritional status of these nutrients on the proper functioning of the immune system as well as their potential role in COVID-19 prevention/treatment was carried out by searching for available scientific evidence in PubMed and LitCovid databases. Second, a compilation from published sources and an analysis of nutritional data from 10 European countries was performed, and the relationship between country nutritional status and epidemiological COVID-19 data (available in the Worldometers database) was evaluated following an ecological study design. Furthermore, the potential effect of genetics was considered through the selection of genetic variants previously identified in Genome-Wide Association studies (GWAs) as influencing the nutritional status of these 10 considered nutrients. Therefore, access to genetic information in accessible databases (1000genomes, by Ensembl) of individuals from European populations enabled an approximation that countries might present a greater risk of suboptimal status of the nutrients studied. Results from the review approach show the importance of maintaining a correct nutritional status of these 10 nutrients analyzed for the health of the immune system, highlighting the importance of Vitamin D and iron in the context of COVID-19. Besides, the ecological study demonstrates that intake levels of relevant micronutrients-especially Vitamins D, C, B12, and iron-are inversely associated with higher COVID-19 incidence and/or mortality, particularly in populations genetically predisposed to show lower micronutrient status. In conclusion, nutrigenetic data provided by joint assessment of 10 essential nutrients for the functioning of the immune system and of the genetic factors that can limit their bioavailability can be a fundamental tool to help strengthen the immune system of individuals and prepare populations to fight against infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (which causes COVID-19 - a viral, breathing-related illness) has caused shock waves in many countries, producing a global health crisis. Lack of knowledge of how the virus works, plus the absence of effective treatments against Covid-19 and/or vaccines have put the immune system and its ability to fight disease in the spotlight. Having a healthy balance of specific nutrients is key to keeping parts of the immune system working in order to avoid and fight infections. There are 6 vitamins (D, A, C, Folate, B6, B12) and 4 minerals (zinc, iron, copper and selenium) that the European Food Safety Authority sees as important for the immune system to function well. In this report is an update on the evidence of 1) how nutrition impacts the immune system, 2) what things might reduce how long nutrients stay in the body, and 3) the role of the healthy balance of these nutrients during the Covid-19 pandemic. First, researchers review available scientific data on the impact of a healthy balance of these nutrients on the immune system, as well as their role in Covid-19 prevention and treatment. Second, nutrition data from 10 European countries are compiled and analyzed, and the relationship between country nutrition and Covid-19 data is evaluated. Additionally, the possible effect of genes on nutrient balance is considered for these 10 nutrients. Using genetic information from available databases, researchers estimated that countries may be at a greater risk of low nutritional balance. Results from the review show the importance of keeping a correct nutritional balance of these 10 nutrients for the health of the immune system and highlights the importance of Vitamin D and iron in the context of Covid-19. The study of these nutrients and their environment shows that the amount consumed of certain vitamins and minerals-especially Vitamins D, C, B12, and iron-are inversely or oppositely associated with higher Covid-19 numbers and/or death (i.e., the higher the nutrition, the lower the risk of Covid-19 illness and vice versa). This finding is very important for groups with genes shown to lower micronutrient status. In conclusion, using nutritional and genetic data and how they influence the immune system and how long nutrients stay in the body can be key tools to help strengthen the immune system of individuals and prepare people to fight viruses such as Covid-19.",

18,17296512,"Aim: To measure ketonemia in a control population of pregnant women and in a population of women with gestational diabetes (GDM). To define a normal ketonemia threshold for the controls and to determine whether or not this value could play a role in the clinical management of women with GDM. Method: Fifty-six women with a normal OGTT and 49 women with GDM were included and monitored from the 25th to the 37th week of pregnancy. Control subjects agreed to perform glycaemia and ketonemia self-monitoring 3 times a day. In addition, women with GDM were asked to measure their postprandial glycaemia. Glycaemia and ketonemia measurements were performed using Optium meters. Subjects kept a 24-hour food record twice a week. Results: The mean ketonemia was lower in the control group than in the GDM group (0.01+/-0.10 vs. 0.04+/-0.009 mmol/l; P<0.001). Ketonemia values measured before the midday meal and prior to the evening meal were lower for control subjects than for GDM patients (P=0.002 and P=0.005). Fasting ketonemia was unrelated to ketonuria in the GDM group, whereas there was a correlation in the control group (P=0.006). At least one chronic increase in ketonemia levels was observed in 47% of the women with GDM, compared with only 12% of controls. The lowest levels of evening glycaemia correlated with the highest levels of ketonemia; women with GDM reported lower food and carbohydrate intakes than controls (P<0.001). Conclusion: This work has enabled the establishment of ketonemia reference standards in non-diabetic pregnant women. If ketonemia does indeed indicate overly restrictive dietary behavior, this parameter could be employed for monitoring adherence to the nutritional recommendations for GDM.","The aim of this study is to measure ketonemia (amount of ketones, a substance that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar, in the body) in a control (comparison) population of pregnant women and in a population of women with gestational diabetes (women diagnosed with diabetes for the first time during pregnancy). This study also aims to define normal ketonemia levels for the comparison group and to determine whether or not this level could play a role in the care of women with gestational diabetes. This study included 56 women with normal oral glucose tolerance test results (a test that measures how the body moves sugar from blood to the tissues). Women in the comparison group agreed to monitor glycaemia (blood sugar levels) and ketonemia themselves 3 times a day. In addition, women with gestational diabetes were asked to measure their blood glucose after a meal. Glycaemia and ketonemia measurements are performed using a small finger stick device. Study participants keep a 24-hour food diary twice a week. The average ketonemia is lower in the comparison group than in the gestational diabetes group. Ketonemia values measured before the midday meal and before the evening meal are lower for the comparison group than for patients with gestational diabetes. Fasting (no food) ketonemia is unrelated to ketonuria (high amounts of ketones in the urine) in the gestational diabetes group, whereas there is a connection in the comparison group. At least one chronic (recurring) increase in ketonemia levels is observed in 47% of the women with gestational diabetes, compared with only 12% in the comparison group. The lowest levels of evening glycaemia correlated with the highest levels of ketonemia; women with gestational diabetes reported lower food and carbohydrate intakes than the comparison group. In conclusion, this work has established ketonemia standards in pregnant women who do not have diabetes. If ketonemia does indicate overly restrictive dietary behavior, this measure could be used for monitoring how well people stick to the nutritional recommendations for gestational diabetes.","The aim is to measure blood ketone bodies (particles made from fat breakdown) in a baseline group of pregnant women and group with gestational diabetes (high blood sugar affecting pregnant women). To define a normal baseline level of blood ketone bodies, made from fat breakdown, and determine if this value could aid management of pregnant women with gestational diabetes or high blood sugar. Fifty-six standard women and 49 with gestational diabetes were measured from the 25th to 37th week of pregnancy. Standard women performed measurements of blood sugar and blood ketone bodies 3 times a day. Also, pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar were asked to measure after-meal blood sugar. Blood and ketone measurements were recorded. Patients kept a 24-hour food record twice a week. Average blood ketone bodies were lower in the standard group than the group with gestational diabetes. Blood ketone bodies measured before the midday and evening meals were lower for standard patients than gestational diabetics. Fasting blood ketone bodies were unrelated to urinary ketone bodies in the pregnant gestational diabetics, unlike the standard group. At least one long-lasting increase in blood ketone bodies occured in 47% of pregnant women with gestational diabetes compared to only 12% of standard patients. The lowest levels of evening blood sugar paralleled the highest levels of blood ketone bodies. Pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar reported lower food and carb intakes than standard women. This work created baselines of blood ketone bodies in non-diabetic pregnant women. If blood ketone bodies do indicate restricting diets, this value may monitor faithfulness to diet recommendations for pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar."
55,28441964,"Background: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is characterized by unexplained persistent fatigue, commonly accompanied by cognitive dysfunction, sleeping disturbances, orthostatic intolerance, fever, lymphadenopathy, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The extent to which the gastrointestinal microbiome and peripheral inflammation are associated with ME/CFS remains unclear. We pursued rigorous clinical characterization, fecal bacterial metagenomics, and plasma immune molecule analyses in 50 ME/CFS patients and 50 healthy controls frequency-matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic site, and season of sampling. Results: Topological analysis revealed associations between IBS co-morbidity, body mass index, fecal bacterial composition, and bacterial metabolic pathways but not plasma immune molecules. IBS co-morbidity was the strongest driving factor in the separation of topological networks based on bacterial profiles and metabolic pathways. Predictive selection models based on bacterial profiles supported findings from topological analyses indicating that ME/CFS subgroups, defined by IBS status, could be distinguished from control subjects with high predictive accuracy. Bacterial taxa predictive of ME/CFS patients with IBS were distinct from taxa associated with ME/CFS patients without IBS. Increased abundance of unclassified Alistipes and decreased Faecalibacterium emerged as the top biomarkers of ME/CFS with IBS; while increased unclassified Bacteroides abundance and decreased Bacteroides vulgatus were the top biomarkers of ME/CFS without IBS. Despite findings of differences in bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways defining ME/CFS subgroups, decreased metabolic pathways associated with unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and increased atrazine degradation pathways were independent of IBS co-morbidity. Increased vitamin B6 biosynthesis/salvage and pyrimidine ribonucleoside degradation were the top metabolic pathways in ME/CFS without IBS as well as in the total ME/CFS cohort. In ME/CFS subgroups, symptom severity measures including pain, fatigue, and reduced motivation were correlated with the abundance of distinct bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways. Conclusions: Independent of IBS, ME/CFS is associated with dysbiosis and distinct bacterial metabolic disturbances that may influence disease severity. However, our findings indicate that dysbiotic features that are uniquely ME/CFS-associated may be masked by disturbances arising from the high prevalence of IBS co-morbidity in ME/CFS. These insights may enable more accurate diagnosis and lead to insights that inform the development of specific therapeutic strategies in ME/CFS subgroups.","Background: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is characterized by unexplained persistent fatigue (long-lasting tiredness). ME/CFS is commonly accompanied by cognitive dysfunction, sleeping disturbances, orthostatic intolerance (inability to stand up quickly), fever, lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS - colon disorder that leads to belly pain, gas, diarrhea, and constipation). The extent to which the stomach microbiome (gut bacteria) and inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting) are associated (linked) with ME/CFS is unknown. This study evaluated 50 ME/CFS patients and 50 healthy controls. Analysis revealed associations between IBS co-morbidity, body mass index, fecal (poop) bacterial composition, and bacterial metabolic pathways. No associated was found between ME/CFS status and plasma (blood) immune molecules. IBS co-morbidity (co-diagnosis) was the most strongly associated endpoint with ME/CFS status. ME/CFS subgroups, defined by IBS status, could be distinguished from control subjects with high predictive accuracy. Bacterial taxa (bacterial groups) predictive of ME/CFS patients with IBS were distinct from taxa associated with ME/CFS patients without IBS. Two bacteria, Alistipes and Faecalibacterium, emerged as the top biomarkers of ME/CFS with IBS. Two bacteria, Bacteroides and Bacteroides vulgatus, were the top biomarkers of ME/CFS without IBS. Decreased metabolic pathways associated with unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and increased atrazine (herbicide) degradation pathways were independent of IBS co-morbidity. Increased vitamin B6 biosynthesis/salvage and pyrimidine ribonucleoside (DNA building blocks) degradation were the top metabolic pathways in ME/CFS without IBS. These pathways were also top in the total ME/CFS cohort. In ME/CFS subgroups, symptom severity measures were correlated with the abundance of distinct bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways. Independent of IBS, ME/CFS is associated with gut microbiome imbalance and distinct bacterial metabolic disturbances. These factors may influence disease severity. These findings indicate that gut microbial imbalance features associated with ME/CFS may be hidden by IBS. These findings may enable more accurate diagnosis and improve therapeutic (treatment) strategies in ME/CFS subgroups.",
42,33827674,"Background: The oncogenic role of histone mutations is one of the most relevant discovery in cancer epigenetics. Recurrent mutations targeting histone genes have been described in pediatric brain tumors, chondroblastoma, giant cell tumor of bone and other tumor types. The demonstration that mutant histones can be oncogenic and drive the tumorigenesis in pediatric tumors, led to the coining of the term ""oncohistones."" The first identified histone mutations were localized at or near residues normally targeted by post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the histone N-terminal tails and suggested a possible interference with histone PTMs regulation and reading. Main body: In this review, we describe the peculiar organization of the multiple genes that encode histone proteins, and the latter advances in both the identification and the biological role of histone mutations in cancer. Recent works show that recurrent somatic mutations target both N-terminal tails and globular histone fold domain in diverse tumor types. Oncohistones are often dominant-negative and occur at higher frequencies in tumors affecting children and adolescents. Notably, in many cases the mutations target selectively only some of the genes coding the same histone protein and are frequently associated with specific tumor types or, as documented for histone variant H3.3 in pediatric glioma, with peculiar tumors arising from specific anatomic locations. Conclusion: The overview of the most recent advances suggests that the oncogenic potential of histone mutations can be exerted, together with the alteration of histone PTMs, through the destabilization of nucleosome and DNA-nucleosome interactions, as well as through the disruption of higher-order chromatin structure. However, further studies are necessary to fully elucidate the mechanism of action of oncohistones, as well as to evaluate their possible application to cancer classification, prognosis and to the identification of new therapies.","The cancer or tumor causing role of changes to histone proteins is one of the most important discoveries in cancer research. Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Recurring mutations (changes) that target histone genes are described in brain tumors in children, in a rare type of noncancerous bone tumor that begins in cartilage chondroblastoma (noncancerous bone tumors in cartilage), and in giant tumors of bones and other types of tumors. The finding that mutant histones can cause cancer and tumors, also called oncogenic, and drive development of tumors in children lead to the new term ""onchohistones"". In this review, researchers describe the organization of the multiple genes that build histone proteins and the role of histone mutations in cancer. Recent works show that recurring mutations during pregnancy target both N-terminal (nitrogen-containing) tails that are on histones and interact with DNA and the central part of the histone that folds in different types of tumors. Oncohistones (the mutant histones that can cause tumors) often occur more in tumors affecting children and adolescents. Notably, in many cases, the mutations target only some of the genes that interact with histone proteins and are frequently associated with specific tumor types or with tumors that come from specific locations. In conclusion, the overview of recent advances suggests that it's possible histones mutation can form cancer or tumors. However, further studies are necessary to fully describe the process of histone proteins that may cause cancer (oncohistones), as well as to evaluate how they might influence cancer classification, the course of the disease, and the identification of new treatments.",
54,24724425,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is generally quantified in serum, but spot urine samples are also used to assess hCG levels in Japan. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate whether urinary hCG can be used clinically as a substitute for serum hCG. A total of 189 samples of serum and spot urine were collected from patients, including cases of normal pregnancy (NP) -13, abortion (AB) -21, extrauterine pregnancy (EP) 25, and hydatidiform mole (MOL) -7, during medical treatment and comparisons were made concerning serum and urinary hCG levels. The histogram of relative urinary/serum hCG(U-hCG.act/S-hCG) of the samples showed a wide distribution of values, but tended to converge to a narrow distribution by creatinine correction (U-hCG.cor/S-hCG). U-hCG.cor/S-hCG of the AB, EP, and MOL groups decreased 1 day to 14 days or was no earlier than 15 days postoperatively compared to preoperatively. The alteration of serum Intact/Total tended to be similar to that of U-hCG.cor/S-hCG in clinical course. The presented case indicated that U-hCG.act/S-hCG did not correspond to serum hCG levels. Because urinary hCG levels are inconsistent depending on whether spot urine is concentrated or diluted, the levels of hCG in spot urine do not always correlate with serum levels of hCG. Therefore, the data of urinary hCG should be interpreted after creatinine correction. Overall, it is recommended to determine serum hCG levels rather than creatinine corrected urinary hCG levels, considering that the relative urinary/serum hCG was not constant postoperatively.","Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG - a pregnancy hormone) is generally measured in serum (blood). However, spot urine samples are also used to assess hCG levels in Japan. The purpose of this study was to understand if urinary hCG can be used clinically as a substitute for serum hCG. A total of 189 samples of serum and spot urine were collected from patients. Samples were collected from patients of normal pregnancy (NP) -13, abortion (AB) -21, extrauterine (outer-womb) pregnancy (EP) 25, and hydatidiform mole (MOL) -7. Sample comparisons were made concerning serum and urinary hCG levels. Hydatidiform mole leads to a cluster of fluid filled sacs from a noncancerous tumor developing in the uterus from a nonviable pregnancy. Initial analysis of sample urinary/serum hCG showed a wide distribution of values. However, the difference in distribution decreased after sample normalization. Urinary/serum hCG of the AB, EP, and MOL groups showed no difference before or after surgery. Serum measurements tended to be similar to that of urinary/serum hCG levels. The presented case indicated that urinary/serum hCG did not correspond (were not linked) to serum hCG levels. Urinary hCG levels are inconsistent depending on whether spot urine is concentrated or diluted. Because of this, hCG levels in spot urine do not always correlate with serum levels of hCG. Data of urinary hCG should be interpreted only after normalization. The authors recommended to determine serum hCG levels rather than normalized urinary hCG levels. This is because the relative urinary/serum hCG was not constant following surgery.",
24,16733942,"A drug interaction refers to an event in which the usual pharmacological effect of a drug is modified by other factors, most frequently additional drugs. When two drugs are administered simultaneously, or within a short time of each other, an interaction can occur that may increase or decrease the intended magnitude or duration of the effect of one or both drugs. Drugs may interact on a pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic basis. Pharmacodynamic interactions arise when the alteration of the effects occurs at the site of action. This is a wide field where not only interactions between different drugs are considered but also drug and metabolites (midazolam/alpha-hydroxy-midazolam), enantiomers (ketamine), as well as phenomena such as tolerance (nordiazepam) and sensitization (diazepam). Pharmacodynamic interactions can result in antagonism or synergism and can originate at a receptor level (antagonism, partial agonism, down-regulation, up-regulation), at an intraneuronal level (transduction, uptake), or at an interneuronal level (physiological pathways). Alternatively, psychotropic drug interactions assessed through quantitative pharmaco-EEG can be viewed according to the broad underlying objective of the study: safety-oriented (ketoprofen/theophylline, lorazepam/diphenhydramine, granisetron/haloperidol), strictly pharmacologically-oriented (benzodiazepine receptors), or broadly neuro-physiologically-oriented (diazepam/buspirone). Methodological issues are stressed, particularly drug plasma concentrations, dose-response relationships and time-course of effects (fluoxetine/buspirone), and unsolved questions are addressed (yohimbine/caffeine, hydroxizyne/alcohol).","A drug interaction is when other things change the usual effects of a drug, most often other drugs. When two drugs are taken at the same time, or within a short time of each other, an interaction can happen that may change the size or length of the effect of one or both drugs. Drugs may interact based on what the drugs do to each other (pharmaceutical), what the body does to the drugs (pharmacokinetic), and what the drugs do to the body (pharmacodynamic). Pharmacodynamic interactions occur when the change in effect happens at the site the drug works at in the body. Phamacodynamics is a wide field. Pharmacodynamic interactions can cause drugs to work together or against each other and can happen at different levels of the body. Drugs that affect the mind, emotions, and behavior measured through a well known tool for finding and characterizing drug effects on the central nervous system (quantitative pharmaco-EEG) can be used based on the aim of the study: safety (ketoprofen/theophylline, lorazepam/diphenhydramine, granisetron/haloperidol), drug properties (benzodiazepine receptors), or brain function (diazepam/buspirone).

Previously, we showed that there is elevated Notch signaling compared to normal renal epithelial cells and that Notch signaling contributes to the proliferation of cystic cells. Quinomycin A, a bis-intercalator peptide, has previously been shown to target the Notch signaling pathway and inhibit tumor growth in cancer. Here, we show that Quinomycin A decreased cell proliferation and cyst growth of human ADPKD cyst epithelial cells cultured within a 3D collagen gel. Treatment with Quinomycin A reduced kidney weight to body weight ratio and decreased renal cystic area and fibrosis in Pkd1RC/RC ; Pkd2+/- mice, an orthologous PKD mouse model. This was accompanied by reduced expression of Notch pathway proteins, RBPjk and HeyL and cell proliferation in kidneys of PKD mice. Quinomycin A treatments also normalized cilia length of cyst epithelial cells derived from the collecting ducts. This is the first study to demonstrate that Quinomycin A effectively inhibits PKD progression and suggests that Quinomycin A has potential therapeutic value for PKD patients.","Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is an inherited disorder of abnormal kidney cell growth and development of many fluid-filled cysts or swellings in the kidneys. Before, we showed there is increased signaling of a specific cell pathway (Notch) compared to normal kidney cells. This Notch signaling contributes to cystic cell growth. Quinomycin A, a specific protein segment, has been shown to target the Notch cell signaling pathway and block tumor growth in cancer. Here, we show that Quinomycin A decreased cell and cyst growth of human, diseased cyst cells created in an isolated environment. Treatment with Quinomycin A reduced kidney weight to body weight ratio and reduced kidney cystic area and scarred tissue in mice with PKD. Reduced amounts of proteins of the Notch cell signaling patway, RBPjk and HeyL, and reduced cell growth in kidneys of PKD mice also occured with the other effects. Quinomycin A also controlled hairlike structions on cyst cells from kidney tubes. This is the first study to show that Quinomycin A blocks PDK progression and suggests that Quinomycin A has beneficial value for PKD patients.","Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal growth and formation of kidney epithelial cells, which are important cells for kidney function, and growth of many cysts (swellings) filled with fluid within the kidneys. Previous studies show that, when compared to epithelial cells, there is an increase in cell signaling called Notch signaling that allows direct cell to cell communication. This Notch signaling contributes to the growth and division of cystic cells (cells that cluster together and form a cyst). Quinomycin A is a type of antibiotic (bacteria-fighting medication), has previously shown to target the Notch signaling process, and slow or stop tumor growth in cancer. In this study, researchers show that quinomycin A decreases cell development and cyst growth of cyst epithelial cells taken from humans with inherited PKD and analyzed in a lab. Treatment with quinomycin A reduces kidney weight to body weight ratio and decreases the size of the kidney cysts and the development of fibrous tissues that can impact the lungs. Also, there is a reduced number of proteins that develop from the Notch pathway. Quinomycin A treatments also normalized the length of cilia, hairlike vibrating structures found in large numbers on the surface of cyst epithelial cells. This is the first study to demonstrate that Quinomycin A effectively slows or stops polycystic kidney disease (PKD) progression and suggests that Quinomycin A is a possible therapy for PKD patients."
44,28346013,"Development of a human model of hemorrhage has provided a unique opportunity to investigate the underlying physiology that defines the individual capacity to avoid the life-threatening clinical condition of inadequate tissue oxygenation known as “shock.” The experimental approach of progressively reducing central blood volume to the point of hemodynamic decompensation with the use of lower body negative pressure has revealed stark distinctions in the physiological compensatory responses between individuals with high compared with low tolerances to blood loss. High tolerance to hemorrhage is defined by a capacity to maintain systemic perfusion pressure and reduce the rate of cerebral hypoperfusion by: (1) protecting cardiac output with greater elevations in heart rate associated with greater cardiac vagal withdrawal and sympathetically mediated adrenergic stimulation; (2) greater increases in systemic peripheral vascular resistance associated with higher sympathetic nerve activation and levels of circulating vasopressor endocrine responses; (3) alternating blood flow between the brain and peripheral tissue with greater sympathetically mediated oscillatory patterns of systemic pressure and flow; and (4) enhancing cardiac filling and cerebral perfusion pressure gradient by optimizing the respiratory pump. When the capacity for these compensatory responses is exhausted, an active vasodilation drops resistance to blood flow allowing for increased perfusion of peripheral tissue. When cardiac filling is no longer adequate to maintain systemic pressure and flow, a reflex-mediated pronounced bradycardia leads to the initiation of decompensatory shock.","A human model of hemorrhage (excessive bleeding) provides the opportunity to investigate the underlying mechanisms that can help someone avoid the life-threatening condition of inadequate tissue oxygenation known as ""shock."" This is completed by experimentally reducing central blood volume. Blood volume is progressively decreased to the point of critically low blood pressure. This test approach has shown differences in the bodily responses between individuals with high tolerances versus low tolerances to blood loss. High tolerance to hemorrhage is defined by maintaining body wide blood flow pressure and prevent decreased brain blood pressure. This is done by one of four ways. First, by protecting cardiac output with greater elevations in heart rate associated with greater cardiac vagal withdrawal and sympathetically mediated adrenergic stimulation. Second, a greater increases in systemic peripheral vascular resistance (blood vessel resistance) associated with higher sympathetic nerve activation (fight-or-flight reaction) and levels of circulating vasopressor endocrine responses (responses from chemical messengers). Third, an alternating blood flow between the brain and peripheral tissue with greater sympathetically mediated oscillatory patterns of systemic pressure and flow. Lastly, by enhancing cardiac filling and cerebral perfusion pressure gradient (pressure driving oxygen to brain tissue) by optimizing the respiratory pump (muscles that help the lung extract and contract). When these compensatory responses are exhausted, an active vasodilation (enlargement of blood vessels) drops resistance to blood flow allowing for increased perfusion of peripheral tissue. When the body no is longer able to maintain systemic pressure and flow, a decreased heart rate leads to the initiation of decompensatory shock.",
7,25296661,"Background: Diagnosing group A streptococcus (Strep A) throat infection by clinical examination is difficult, and misdiagnosis may lead to inappropriate antibiotic use. Most patients with sore throat seek symptom relief rather than antibiotics, therefore, therapies that relieve symptoms should be recommended to patients. We report two clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenge in patients with and without streptococcal sore throat. Methods: The studies enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe throat symptoms (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing and swollen throat) and a diagnosis of pharyngitis. The practitioner assessed the likelihood of Strep A infection based on historical and clinical findings. Patients were randomised to flurbiprofen 8.75 mg or placebo lozenges under double-blind conditions and reported the three throat symptoms at baseline and at regular intervals over 24 h. Results: A total of 402 patients received study medication (n = 203 flurbiprofen, n = 199 placebo). Throat culture identified Strep A in 10.0% of patients and group C streptococcus (Strep C) in a further 14.0%. The practitioners' assessments correctly diagnosed Strep A in 11/40 cases (sensitivity 27.5%, and specificity 79.7%). A single flurbiprofen lozenge provided significantly greater relief than placebo for all three throat symptoms, lasting 3-4 h for patients with and without Strep A/C. Multiple doses of flurbiprofen lozenges over 24 h also led to symptom relief, although not statistically significant in the Strep A/C group. There were no serious adverse events. Conclusions: The results highlight the challenge of identifying Strep A based on clinical features. With the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, non-antibiotic treatments should be considered. As demonstrated here, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges are an effective therapeutic option, providing immediate and long-lasting symptom relief in patients with and without Strep A/C infection.","Diagnosing group A strep throat (Strep A) by a physical exam is difficult, and diagnosing it incorrectly may lead to use of the wrong antibiotic. Doctors should suggest treatments that improve symptoms to people with sore throat because most do not want antibiotics. We looked at two studies on how well flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenge works and how safe it is in people with and without strep throat. We studied adults with moderate-to-severe throat symptoms (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing and swollen throat) and a diagnosis of strep throat. The doctor determined how likely it was that people have Strep A infection based on the history of the patient and a physical exam. We gave people either flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges or sugar lozenges and they reported three throat symptoms (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing and swollen throat) at the beginning of the study and regularly over 24 h. We gave 203 people flurbiprofen 8.75 mg and 199 people sugar lozenges, for a total of 402 people. A throat swab to find, grow, and test bacteria in the throat found Strep A in 10% of people and group C strep (Strep C) in 14% of people. The doctors correctly diagnosed Strep A in 11 of 40 cases. People had greater symptom relief with one flurbiprofen lozenge than one sugar lozenge for three throat symptoms (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing and swollen throat), lasting 3-4 h for people with and without Strep A or C. People with Strep A or C may have some symptom relief with more than one flurbiprofen lozenge over 24 h. There were no serious side effects. We conclude that the studies emphasize the difficulty of identifying Strep A based on signs and symptoms. With the growing problem of bacteria able to defeat the antibiotics designed to kill them, treatments that are not antibiotics should be considered. As shown here, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges work, giving immediate and long-lasting symptom relief in people with and without Strep A or C infection.","Identifying bacterial group A strep (Strep A) throat infection by examination is difficult. Misidentifying may lead to innappropriate antibacterial antibiotic use. Most with sore throat seek symptom relief rather than antibacterial antibiotics, so therapies that relieve symptoms should be promoted. We show two trials on the success and safety of anti-inflammatory fluriboprofen lozenges in those with and without strep throat. The studies enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe throat symptoms (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing and swollen throat) and with inflammation of the pharynx (specific throat area). The practitioner measured risk of Strep A bacterial infection by historical and medical findings. Patients were randomised to anti-inflammatory flurbiprofen or inactive treatment. They also reported three throat symptoms at start and regular intervals over 24 hours. 402 patients received treatment (203 with antinflammatory flurbiprofen and 199 with inactive treatment). Testing isolated throat cells identified bacterial Strep A in 10% of patients and group C streptococcus (Strep C) in another 14%. The practitioners correctly identified Strep A in 11/40 cases. A single anti-inflammatory flurbiprofen lozenge gave more relief than the inactive treatment for all three throat symptoms and for 3-4 hours. Multiple doses of flurbiprofen over 24 hours led to mild, negligible symptom relief. There were no serious side effects. It is difficult identifying bacterial Strep A by clinical features. With growing antibiotic resistance, non-antibiotic treatments should be considered. As seen here, anti-inflammatory flurbiprofen lozenges are effective treatment, giving immediate and long-lasting symptom relief."

40,20483864,"Background: A too high resting pressure of compression devices is poorly tolerated and may cause skin defects, especially in patients with concomitant arterial occlusive disease. Aim: To investigate whether low compression pressure will improve venous pumping function in patients with venous incompetence. Material and methods: Venous pumping function was assessed in 20 patients with severe reflux in the great saphenous vein by measuring ejection fraction (EF) using strain-gauge plethysmography. Measurements were repeated after application of knee-high medical compression stockings and of inelastic bandages applied with a pressure of 20, 40 and 60 mmHg in the supine position. Results: EF was significantly reduced compared with healthy controls. Compression stockings exerting a median pressure of 27 mmHg (interquartile range [IQR] 25-29) in the supine and 30.5 mmHg (IQR 28.25-34.25) in the standing position produced a moderate, non-significant improvement of EF of 17%. Inelastic bandages with a resting pressure of 20.5 mmHg (IQR 20-22) in the supine position resulting in a standing pressure of 36 mmHg (IQR 33-40.75) led to a significant increase of EF of 61.5% (P < 0.01). A further increase of the resting pressure to 40 and 60 mmHg achieved an increase of the EF of 91% and 98%, respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusions: In patients with venous pumping failure, inelastic bandages produce a significant pressure-dependent increase of EF. A significant improvement in venous pumping function was achieved with inelastic bandages even at a resting pressure of 20 mmHg.","A too high pressure from compression devices is poorly tolerated and may causes skin damage, espeically in those with blocked blood vessels in limbs. We aim to check if low compression pressure may improve blood vessel pumping in patients with impaired blood vessels. Blood vessel pumping function was measured in 20 patients with severely impaired blood flow in the body's largest vein. Measurements were repeated after using knee-high compression socks and inelastic bandages applied with low, medium, and high pressure while lying down. The amount of blood pumped was compared to healthy patients. Compression socks exerted an average pressure of 27 mmHg while lying down and slightly higher pressure of 30.5 mmHg while standing. This led to a minor improvement in the amount of blood pumped, or ejection fraction (EF), by 17%. Inelastic bandages with a pressure of 20.5 mmHg while lying down led to a standing pressure of 36 mmHg, which led to a major increase in EF by 61.5%. A larger increase of pressure to 40 and 60 mmHg led to an increase in the amount of blood pumped of 91% and 98%, respectively. In those with impaired blood vessel pumping, inelastic bandages lead to a pressure-dependent increase of EF. Inelastic bandages even with a pressure of 20 mmHg improved blood vessel pumping.","A too high resting pressure of compression devices, or when the device is just lying on the skin, is poorly tolerated and may cause skin defects. This is especially common in patients with concomitant arterial occlusive disease, blockage of an artery. The goal of this study was to investigate if low compression pressure improves vein pumping function in patients with defective veins. Vein pumping function was assessed (measured) in 20 patients with severe reflux, or the backup of blood, in the great saphenous vein in the leg. This was done by measuring ejection fraction (EF; percentage of blood leaving the heart when it contracts). Measurements were taken after application of knee-high medical compression stockings and of inelastic bandages applied while lying down. Results showed EF was significantly reduced compared with healthy controls. Compression stockings produced a moderate, non-significant improvement of EF. Inelastic bandages led to a significant increase of EF. Increased pressure of the inelastic bandages achieved an increase of the EF. The study concluded that, in patients with venous (vein) pumping failure, inelastic bandages produce a significant pressure-dependent increase of EF. This means that as pressure increases, EF increases. Significant improvement in venous pumping function was achieved with inelastic bandages, even at resting pressures."

26,33176093,"Background: The efficacy of public health measures to control the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been well studied in young adults. Methods: We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infections among U.S. Marine Corps recruits who underwent a 2-week quarantine at home followed by a second supervised 2-week quarantine at a closed college campus that involved mask wearing, social distancing, and daily temperature and symptom monitoring. Study volunteers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by means of quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay of nares swab specimens obtained between the time of arrival and the second day of supervised quarantine and on days 7 and 14. Recruits who did not volunteer for the study underwent qPCR testing only on day 14, at the end of the quarantine period. We performed phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes obtained from infected study volunteers to identify clusters and to assess the epidemiologic features of infections. Results: A total of 1848 recruits volunteered to participate in the study; within 2 days after arrival on campus, 16 (0.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 15 of whom were asymptomatic. An additional 35 participants (1.9%) tested positive on day 7 or on day 14. Five of the 51 participants (9.8%) who tested positive at any time had symptoms in the week before a positive qPCR test. Of the recruits who declined to participate in the study, 26 (1.7%) of the 1554 recruits with available qPCR results tested positive on day 14. No SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified through clinical qPCR testing performed as a result of daily symptom monitoring. Analysis of 36 SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from 32 participants revealed six transmission clusters among 18 participants. Epidemiologic analysis supported multiple local transmission events, including transmission between roommates and among recruits within the same platoon. Conclusions: Among Marine Corps recruits, approximately 2% who had previously had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of supervised quarantine, and less than 2% of recruits with unknown previous status, tested positive by day 14. Most recruits who tested positive were asymptomatic, and no infections were detected through daily symptom monitoring. Transmission clusters occurred within platoons.","The strength of current public health measures to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or COVID-19 (a viral respiratory disease), has not been well studied in young adults. The authors investigated COVID-19 infections amongst U.S. Marine Corps recruits. These recruits underwent a two-week quarantine )or isolation) within their personal homes before participating in a second two-week quarantine. The second quarantine was supervised at a closed college campus where recruits wore masks, practiced social distancing, and received daily temperature and symptoms monitoring. Participants in the study were tested for COVID-19 by using nose swabs taken between the time of arrival and the second day of supervised quarantine. A second COVID-19 test run with nose swab samples was conducted on days 7 and 14. Marine recruits who did not want to participate in the study only received one COVID-19 test on day 14 (the final day of supervised quarantine). To identify clusters of unique COVID-19 cases and to better understand how the virus affects public health, the researchers studied the genetic makeup of COVID-19 within samples from the nose swabs. In total, 1848 recruits volunteered to participate in the study. Within the first two days of supervised quarantine, 16 recruits tested positive for (or had) COVID-19. Fifteen of the 16 positive cases did not show symptoms of illness. An additional 35 participants tested positive on day 7 or on day 14. Fifty-one participants tested positive at any time. Five of these patients had symptoms before their COVID-19 test returned positive. Of the recruits who declined to participate in the study, 26 of the 1554 recruits with available COVID-19 test results were positive on day 14. No COVID-19 infections were identified through clinical testing performed as a result of daily symptom monitoring. The evaluation of the genetic makeup of the virus identified six spreading clusters among 18 participants. Tracing of the virus transmission identified several spreading events, including between roommates and among recruits within the same platoon. The authors concluded that among the recruits, around 2% of those who had tested negative for (or did not have) COVID-19 on day 1 of supervised quarantine, along with 2% of those with unknown previous status, tested positive by day 14.

20,12097783,"Objective: Although continuing antidepressant treatment after patients have responded to medication has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of relapse, this risk is not eliminated. A number of theories have been proposed to account for this apparent loss of efficacy. A common initial approach to managing relapse is to increase the dose of antidepressant. We prospectively evaluated the likelihood of response to increasing the fluoxetine doses in patients relapsing during a long-term efficacy study of two fluoxetine dosing regimens. Method: Patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder with modified HAMD17 scores > or =18 and CGI-severity scores > or =4 were treated for 13 weeks with open-label 20 mg/day fluoxetine in a multicenter US study. Responders (n = 501) were randomized to 20 mg fluoxetine daily, placebo, or 90 mg enteric-coated fluoxetine weekly for 25 weeks of double-blind continuation treatment. If the patients relapsed during the continuation phase, they were offered a 25-week optional rescue treatment phase during which the study medication dose was increased as follows: (1) patients on placebo had treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg/day reinitiated, (2) patients on fluoxetine 20 mg/day had their dose increased to 40 mg/day, and (3) patients on a 90-mg weekly dose had their dose increased to 90 mg twice a week. The results of the rescue phase for the latter two groups who relapsed while on continuation treatment with fluoxetine are reported. Response was defined as a 50% reduction in the modified HAMD17 score since time of relapse and a CGI-severity score < or =2. Additional efficacy analyses included HAMD and CGI-severity changes from baseline to endpoint. Safety measures included assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Results: Overall, patients relapsing during the continuation treatment responded to an increased dose (57% of the 40-mg-daily group and 72% of the enteric-coated 90-mg-twice-weekly group). Mean modified HAMD17 scores decreased from a mean of approximately 20 to below 8 and were maintained for up to 6 months in the responders. Thirty-five percent of patients either did not respond or initially responded but again relapsed after augmentation of medication. Conclusions: The patients relapsing after initially responding to fluoxetine can benefit from an increase in fluoxetine dose. These results also generally support increasing dose as a first-line treatment strategy for a patient who has relapsed while taking a previously effective dose of an antidepressant. Increasing enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg once weekly to twice weekly appeared to be as well-tolerated and effective in restoring response as increasing a daily fluoxetine dose from 20 to 40 mg.","Continuing treatment with antidepressants after patients have responded to medication has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of relapse, which is when a medical condition that had previously improved starts to worsen. However, the risk of a relapse is not completely eliminated. A number of theories have been suggested to account for this possible decline in how well antidepressant medicines work. A common first approach to help a patient who is relapsing is to increase the dose of the antidepressant medicine. Researchers evaluated the chance patients will respond to an increase in the dose of fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) in patients relapsing during a long-term study of two different dosing plans of fluoxetine. Patients who have major depressive disorder are treated for 13 weeks with 20 mg/day of fluoxetine in a large US study. The 501 patients who responded to the medicine are randomly put into either the group receiving 20 mg/day of fluoxetine, the group receiving sham treatment that has the appearance of the drug but is not the real medicine, or 90 mg of fluoxetine weekly. They will be in these groups for 25 weeks during a part of the study called the continuation phase. If the patients relapse during the continuation phase, they are offered a different 25-week treatment plan called a rescue phase where the study medication dose is increased as 1) patients on placebo will restart fluoxetine at 20 mg/day, 2) patients on fluoxetine 20 mg/day will have their dose increased to 40 mg/day, and 3) patients on the 90-mg weekly dose will have their dose increased to 90-mg twice a week. The results of the rescue phase the patients in group 2 (who received 20 mg/day) and group 3 (who received the 90-mg weekly). Researchers used scoring tools that measure depression severity and seeing how much the depression scores are reduced since the time of the last relapse. Additional analyses to evaluate how well the medicine worked include changes in these scoring tools from the start of the study to the end. Safety checks include assessment of unexpected side effects, vital signs (e.g. blood pressure, temperature), and tests done in a lab. Overall, patients relapsing during the continuation treatment phase responded to an increased dose (57% of the 40-mg-daily group and 72% of the 90-mg-twice-weekly group). The average score of the tool that measure depression severity decreased and was maintained for up to 6 months in the people who responded. There are 35 patients who either did not respond or responded at first but then relapsed after increasing medication. In conclusion, patients who relapsed after first responding to fluoxetine can benefit from an increase in the dose amount of fluoxetine. These results also generally support increasing the dose as a first-line treatment plan for a patient who has relapsed while taking a previously effective dose of an antidepressant. Increasing fluoxetine 90 mg once weekly to twice weekly appears to have side effects that patients can handle and is just as effective in restoring response as when daily fluoxetine dose is increased from 20 mg to 40 mg.",
34,33388899,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent worldwide public burden that increasingly compromises overall health as the disease progresses. Two of the most negatively affected tissues are bone and skeletal muscle, with CKD negatively impacting their structure, function and activity, impairing the quality of life of these patients and contributing to morbidity and mortality. Whereas skeletal health in this population has conventionally been associated with bone and mineral disorders, sarcopenia has been observed to impact skeletal muscle health in CKD. Indeed, bone and muscle tissues are linked anatomically and physiologically, and together regulate functional and metabolic mechanisms. With the initial crosstalk between the skeleton and muscle proposed to explain bone formation through muscle contraction, it is now understood that this communication occurs through the interaction of myokines and osteokines, with the skeletal muscle secretome playing a pivotal role in the regulation of bone activity. Regular exercise has been reported to be beneficial to overall health. Also, the positive regulatory effect that exercise has been proposed to have on bone and muscle anatomical, functional, and metabolic activity has led to the proposal of regular physical exercise as a therapeutic strategy for muscle and bone-related disorders. The detection of bone- and muscle-derived cytokine secretion following physical exercise has strengthened the idea of a cross communication between these organs. Hence, this review presents an overview of the impact of CKD in bone and skeletal muscle, and narrates how these tissues intrinsically communicate with each other, with focus on the potential effect of exercise in the modulation of this intercommunication.","Chronic kidney disease is a common health condition around the world and impacts the overall health of a person as the disease gets worse. Bones and muscles attached to bones are tissues highly affected by chronic kidney disease, which damages their functions and activities and contributes to poor quality of life. Sarcopenia is a disorder that results in loss of muscle mass and function and is found to impact overall skeletal muscle health in chronic kidney disease. Bone and muscle tissues are linked in the body, and together, they regulate systems in the body that help the body function and process and distribute nutrients. The skeletal muscle cells release small proteins that regulate different parts of the body, including bone activity. Regular exercise is found to be beneficial to overall health. Also, the positive effect exercise is thought to have on bones and muscles, as well as on function and activity, leads to the suggestion of regular physical exercise as a way to help muscle and bone-related disorders. The detection of bone and muscle proteins after exercise strengthens the idea of a cross communication between these organs. This review presents an overview of the impact of chronic kidney disease in bones and muscles attached to bones and describes how these tissues communicate with each other, with a focus on the possible effect of exercise.",
37,30335626,"Background: Pregabalin has shown opioid sparing and analgesic effects in the early postoperative period; however, perioperative effects on cognition have not been studied. A randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled investigation in 80 donor nephrectomy patients was previously performed that evaluated the analgesic, opioid-sparing, and antihyperalgesic effects of pregabalin. This article describes a secondary exploratory analysis that tested the hypothesis that pregabalin would impair cognitive function compared to placebo. Methods: Eighty patients scheduled for donor nephrectomy participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled study. Pregabalin (150 mg twice daily, n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) was administered on the day of surgery and the first postoperative day, in addition to a pain regimen consisting of opioids, steroids, local anesthetics, and acetaminophen. Specific cognitive tests measuring inhibition, sustained attention, psychomotor speed, visual memory, and strategy were performed at baseline, 24 h, and 3 to 5 days after surgery, using tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Results: In the spatial working memory within errors test, the number of errors increased with pregabalin compared to placebo 24 h after surgery; median (25th, 75th percentile) values were 1 (0, 6) versus 0 (0, 1; rate ratio [95% CI], 3.20 [1.55 to 6.62]; P = 0.002). Furthermore, pregabalin significantly increased the number of errors in the stop-signal task stop-go test compared with placebo; median (25th, 75th percentile) values were 3 (1, 6) versus 1 (0, 2; rate ratio, 2.14 [1.13 to 4.07]; P = 0.020). There were no significant differences between groups in the paired associated learning, reaction time, rapid visual processing, or spatial working memory strategy tests. Conclusions: Perioperative pregabalin significantly negatively affected subdomains of executive functioning, including inhibition, and working memory compared to placebo, whereas psychomotor speed was not changed.","Pregabalin is a nerve pain medication. The drug has been shown to help reduce opioid use (opioid-sparing) and have pain relieving (analgesic) effects in the early period following a surgery. However, effects before, during, and after surgery on cognition (thinking ability) have not been studied. A study in 80 patients that had one or both of their kidneys removed was previously conducted to evaluate the opioid-sparing, analgesic, and antihyperalgesic (reduction of pain sensitivity) effects of pregabalin. This paper describes a secondary investigation that tested if pregabalin would impair cognitive function when compared to a control (no treatment) group. Eighty patients scheduled for donor nephrectomy (removal of one or both kidneys) participated in this study. Pregabalin (150 mg twice daily) or placebo (a harmless pill) was administered (given) on the day of surgery and the first post-operation day. This was given in addition to a pain regimen consisting of opioids, steroids, local anesthetics, and acetaminophen (pain medication). Cognitive tests measuring inhibition (restraint), sustained attention, psychomotor (movement) speed, visual memory, and strategy were performed before, 24 h, and 3 to 5 days after surgery. The spatial working memory test is used to determine if a participant can recall the configuration of a series of images. During the test, the number of errors increased with pregabalin treatment compared to placebo 24 h after surgery. Furthermore, pregabalin significantly increased the number of errors in the stop-signal task stop-go test compared with placebo. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the paired associated learning, reaction time, rapid visual processing, or spatial working memory strategy tests. Perioperative (around surgery time) pregabalin significantly negatively affected several aspects of cognitive function when compared to placebo. However, psychomotor speed or movement was not changed.",
31,29795977,"Aim: The aim of this study was to summarize the characteristics, efficacy, and safety of vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) inhibitors for treating tardive dyskinesia (TD). Materials and methods: We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Database, and ClinicalTrials.gov, screening for systematic reviews, meta-analyses or double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (DBRPCTs) reporting efficacy or safety data of VMAT-2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine) in patients with TD. A random effects meta-analysis of efficacy and safety data from DBRPCTs was performed. Results: Two acute, 12-week DBRPCTs with deutetrabenazine 12-48 mg/day (n=413) and 4 acute, 4-6-week double-blind trials with valbenazine 12.5-100 mg/day (n=488) were meta-analyzable, without meta-analyzable, high-quality data for tetrabenazine. Regarding reduction in total Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores (primary outcome), both deutetrabenazine (k=2, n=413, standardized mean difference [SMD] =-0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] =-0.19, -0.62, p<0.001; weighted mean difference (WMD) =-1.44, 95% CI =-0.67, -2.19, p<0.001) and valbenazine (k=4, n=421, SMD =-0.58, 95% CI =-0.26, -0.91, p<0.001; WMD =-2.07, 95% CI =-1.08, -3.05, p<0.001) significantly outperformed placebo. Results were confirmed regarding responder rates (≥50% AIMS total score reduction; deutetrabenazine: risk ratio [RR] =2.13, 95% CI =1.10, 4.12, p=0.024, number-needed-to-treat [NNT] =7, 95% CI =3, 333, p=0.046; valbenazine: RR =3.05, 95% CI =1.81, 5.11, p<0.001, NNT =4, 95% CI =3, 6, p<0.001). Less consistent results emerged from patient-rated global impression-based response (p=0.15) and clinical global impression for deutetrabenazine (p=0.088), and for clinical global impression change for valbenazine (p=0.67). In an open-label extension (OLE) study of deutetrabenazine (≤54 weeks) and a dose-blinded valbenazine study (≤48 weeks), responder rates increased over time. With valbenazine, discontinuation effects were studied, showing TD symptom recurrence towards baseline severity levels within 4 weeks after valbenazine withdrawal. No increased cumulative or specific adverse (AEs) events versus placebo (acute trials) in extension versus acute trial data were observed. Conclusion: The 2 VMAT-2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, are effective in treating TD, both acutely and long-term, without concerns about increased risk of depression or suicide in the TD population. No head-to-head comparison among VMAT-2 inhibitors and no high-quality, meta-analyzable data are available for tetrabenazine in patients with TD.","We aimed to summarize the characteristics, how well it works, and safety of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT-2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), for treating tardive dyskinesia (TD) - a movement disorder. We searched for published scientific studies, including studies that summarized other studies, used statistics to combine results from other studies, or randomly assigned participants to groups receiving TD treatment or sugar pills that looked at how well treatments worked and safety of VMAT-2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine) in patients with TD. We used statistical methods to determine how well treatments work and safety results across multiple studies. We used statistical methods to combine results from two 12-week studies with deutetrabenazine 12-48 mg/day (413 patients) and four 4-6 week studies with valbenazine 12.5-100 mg/day (488 patients). No high-quality data were available for tetrabenazine for a similar analysis. Results favored deutetrabenazine and valbenazine over sugar pills in scores on a rating scale that measures involuntary movements (AIMS). The percentage of patients who had 50% reduction in scores on the same rating scale (AIMS) favored deutetrabenazine and valbenazine over sugar pills. Results were less consistent using another rating scale done by patients and doctors for deutetrabenazine and by doctors for valbenazine. In one study of deutetrabenazine and one study of valbenazine, the percentage of patients who had a 50% reduction in scores on the AIMS rating scale went up over time. Effects of stopping valbenazine were studied, showing TD symptoms returning to levels before stopping valbenazine within 4 weeks of stopping the drug. No increased unfavorable and unintended effects were observed in studies where participants continued to take the studied drug compared to sugar pills. We conclude that the 2 VMAT-2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, work to treat TD, both in the short- and long-term, without causing increased risk of depression or suicide in people with TD. No studies comparing VMAT-2 inhibitors or high-quality tetrabenazine data that could be compared across studies were available.","This study's aim was to summarize the characteristics, effect, and safety of vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) inhibitors, drugs that treat movement disorders, for treating tardive dyskinesia (TD), a movement disorder of irregular, jerking movements. We searched online for studies reporting the effect and safety of VMAT-2 inhibitors like tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine in patients with TD. Two short, 12-week studies with deutetrabenazine12-48 mg/day (with 413 patients) and 4 short, 4-6-week studies with valbenazine 12.5-100 mg/day (with 488 patients) were analyzed. There was no high-quality data for tetrabenazine. Regarding reducing irregular, involuntary movements (the primary symptom), both deutetrabenazine and valbenazine outperformed placebo or a dummy treatment. Results were confirmed regarding responder rates, or the proportion of patients with a reduction in symptoms in a define period of time. Patient-rated global impressions for deutetrabenazine and clinical global impressions for deutetrabenazine and valbenazine were less strong. In a long-term study of deutetrabenazine (≤54 weeks) and a valbenazine study (≤48 weeks), responder rates increased. With valbenazine, drug use stoppage effects were studied, showing TD symptom reappearance of initial severity 4 weeks after valbenazine stoppage. No increased or specific, serious or adverse events (AEs) versus dummy treatment (acute trials) in long-term versus short-term trials were seen. The 2 VMAT-2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, can treat TD, both short- and long-term, without concerns about increased risk of depression or suicide in the TD population. No direct comparison between the VMAT-2 inhibitors and no high-quality data are available for tetrabenazine in patients with TD."
13,18760136,"Background: Dronedarone is a new multichannel blocker for atrial fibrillation (AF) previously demonstrated to have both rhythm and rate control properties in paroxysmal and persistent AF. The Efficacy and safety of dRonedArone for The cOntrol of ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation (ERATO) trial assessed the efficacy of dronedarone in the control of ventricular rate in patients with permanent AF, when added to standard therapy. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, multinational trial, dronedarone, 400 mg twice a day (n = 85), or matching placebo (n = 89) was administered for 6 months to adult patients with permanent AF, in addition to standard therapy. The primary end point was the change in mean ventricular rate between baseline and day 14, as assessed by 24-hour Holter. Ventricular rate was also assessed during submaximal and maximal exercise. Results: Dronedarone significantly decreased mean 24-hour ventricular rate. Compared with placebo, the mean treatment effect at day 14 was a reduction of 11.7 beats per minute (beat/min; P < .0001). Comparable reductions were sustained throughout the 6-month trial. During maximal exercise and compared to placebo, there was a mean reduction of 24.5 beat/min (P < .0001), without any reduction in exercise tolerance as measured by maximal exercise duration. The effects of dronedarone were additive to those of other rate-control agents, including beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and digoxin. Dronedarone was well tolerated, with no organ toxicities or proarrhythmia. Conclusion: In addition to its reported rhythm-targeting and rate-targeting therapeutic actions in paroxysmal and persistent AF, dronedarone improves ventricular rate control in patients with permanent AF. Dronedarone was well tolerated with no evidence of organ toxicities or proarrhythmias in this short-term study.","Dronedarone is a new drug that can treat atrial fibrillation (a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots or stroke) or AF and is found to help control the heart rhythm and heart rate in patients with paroxysmal (when the heart rate returns to normal within 7 days on its own or with treatment) or with persistent (greater than 7 days) atrial fibrillation. A clinical trial called the Efficacy and safety of dRonedArone for The cOntrol of ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation (ERATO) reviewed how well dronedarone worked to control the ventricular rate (heart rate) in patients with permanent AF, when added to other treatments. In this clinical trial of patients with permanent AF, 85 patients receive the dronedarone drug, and 85 receive a placebo (an inactive substance that looks like the treatment drug) for 6 months. A key measure is the average change in ventricular rate between the start of the trial and day 14 of the trial. Ventricular rate is also evaluated during submaximal exercise (any physical activity with increased intensity in which heart rate does not go above 85) and maximal exercise (physical activity increased to come close to fatigue). Dronedarone significantly decreased the average 24-hour ventricular rate. When compared to the placebo group, the average effect of dronedarone on day 14 was a reduction of 11.7 beats per minute. Similar reductions continued throughout the 6-month trial. There was a reduction in heart beats per minute during maximal exercise when compared to the placebo group. The effects of dronedarone were an addition to the effects of other drugs that control heart rate. Dronedarone was well tolerated with few side effects. In addition to its previously demonstrated effects on heart rhythm and rate in short-term and long-term AF, dronedarone improves ventricular rate control in patients with permanent AF. Dronedarone was well tolerated with no evidence of damage to organs or worsening of heart condition in this short-term study.",
12,26277597,"Lower respiratory tract infections by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the foremost cause of infant hospitalization and are implicated in lasting pulmonary impairment and the development of asthma. Neutrophils infiltrate the airways of pediatric patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis in vast numbers: approximately 80% of infiltrated cells are neutrophils. However, why neutrophils are recruited to the site of viral respiratory tract infection is not clear. In this review we discuss the beneficial and pathologic contributions of neutrophils to the immune response against RSV infection. Neutrophils can limit viral replication and spread, as well as stimulate an effective antiviral adaptive immune response. However, low specificity of neutrophil antimicrobial armaments allows for collateral tissue damage. Neutrophil-induced injury to the airways during the delicate period of infant lung development has lasting adverse consequences for pulmonary architecture and might promote the onset of asthma in susceptible subjects. We suggest that pharmacologic modulation of neutrophils should be explored as a viable future therapy for severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis and thereby prevent the inception of subsequent asthma. The antiviral functions of neutrophils suggest that targeting of neutrophils in patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis is best performed under the umbrella of antiviral treatment.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a contagious virus that infects the lungs and airway tubes and can lead to lower respiratory tract infections (infection in the airways). These infections are a common reason for infant hospital stays, long-term lung problems, and the development of asthma, a long-term condition that affects the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs and makes it hard to breathe. Many neutrophils (white blood cells that fight infection) enter the airways of children with bronchiolitis (a common lung infection in children and infants) caused by RSV. However, why neutrophils are sent to the site of lung infection is not clear. This review discusses how neutrophils help the immune system respond to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Neutrophils can limit how the virus spreads and can activate the immune system to fight the virus. Sometimes neutrophils that are fighting infection can lead to tissue damage. Neutrophils that cause injury to airways when an infant's lungs are being developed have a long-term impact on lung function and may lead to asthma. Medications that can change neutrophils may be explored as a possible therapy for bronchiolitis caused by RSV and prevent the development of asthma. For patients with bronchiolitis caused by RSV, it is best to use a general antiviral medication when also using neutrophils to help fight infection.",
30,34206895,"The number of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 has skyrocketed in the past year. Concerns have been raised regarding their performance characteristics, depending on the disease severity and the time of the analysis post-symptom onset (PSO). Thus, independent validations using an unbiased sample selection are required for meaningful serology data interpretation. We aimed to assess the clinical performance of six commercially available assays, the seroconversion, and the dynamics of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study included 528 serum samples from 156 patients with follow-up visits up to six months PSO and 161 serum samples from healthy people. The IgG/total antibodies positive percentage increased and remained above 95% after six months when chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) IgG antiS1/S2 and electro-chemiluminescent assay (ECLIA) total antiNP were used. At early time points PSO, chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) IgM antiS achieved the best sensitivity. IgM and IgG appear simultaneously in most circumstances, and when performed in parallel the sensitivity increases. The severe and the moderate clinical forms were significantly associated with higher seropositivity percentage and antibody levels. High specificity was found in all evaluated assays, but the sensitivity was variable depending on the time PSO, severity of disease, detection method and targeted antigen.","The number of blood tests that check for antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) for the coronavirus (which causes COVID-19, the lung infection) has skyrocketed in the past year. Concerns have been raised on the performance of the tests, depending on the disease severity and the time of the test after symptoms start. Therefore, confirming the performance of the test using an unbiased sample is required in order to understand and describe the antibody data. Researchers aim to assess the performance of six available blood tests, the seroconversion (when the body starts producing antibodies), and how the body creates antibodies in response to coronavirus infection. The study included 528 blood samples from 156 patients with follow-up visits up to 6 months after the start of symptoms and 161 blood samples from healthy people. The total amount of antibodies increased and remained above 95% after six months when using certain tests to identify antibodies. At early times after the start of symptoms, a blood test that looks for certain antibodies that suggest recent infection has the best ability to correctly diagnose a positive (or virus-containing) case. Two types of antibodies, IgM and IgG, appear at the same time in most circumstances, and when performed together, the ability to correctly diagnose a positive diagnosis increases. The severe and the moderate clinical forms have major associations with a higher number of positive tests and antibody levels. The ability to correctly have a negative (or no virus) test among negative people is found in all evaluated blood tests, but the ability to correctly diagnose a true positive varies depending on the time after the start of symptoms and the type of test.",
22,32631372,"Background and objective: The purpose of this study was to create a practical CT-based algorithm to differentiate Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome from other diffuse cystic lung diseases (DCLD). Methods: The study was a retrospective review of the CT images of 33 patients with BHD syndrome, 33 patients with LAM, and 23 patients with NBNL (non-BHD and non-LAM) among DCLD patients. On the basis of the data collected, the CT images were reviewed again to evaluate the characteristics (size, number, distribution, and morphology) of pulmonary cysts. Results: Lower lung-predominant cysts were more likely to be found in patients with BHD syndrome than in patients with LAM or in the NBNL DCLD group. In the axial distribution, 18 of 33 patients in BHD group had cysts that were predominantly near the mediastinum, and all the patients in the LAM and NBNL DCLD groups had diffuse cysts. The appearance of fusiform cysts was more easily observed in patients in the BHD group. In total, 58% patients in the BHD group had less than 50 lung cysts, while all patients in the non-BHD group had more than 50 lung cysts. The biggest cyst was located in the lower lobe in 28 of 33 patients in the BHD group, while 11 of 33 patients in LAM group and 10 patients in the NBNL DCLD group had the biggest cyst in the lower lobe. Conclusion: The pulmonary cysts in patients with BHD tended to be fusiform, less numerous and located predominantly in the lower lobe and near the mediastinum. These radiologic pulmonary features could assist physicians in differentiating BHD from other DCLDs.","The purpose of this study is to create a flow-chart based on x-rays called CT scans to tell the difference between Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome and other lung diseases that have cysts, which are sacs of air or fluid. The study uses CT scans that were taken prior to the study from 33 patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, 33 patients with a rare disease called LAM where a muscle cell grows in the lungs, and 23 patients with other lung diseases that cause cysts (but are not Birt-Hogg-Dubé or LAM). The CT images are reviewed again to determine the size, number, location, and form of pulmonary cysts (cysts filled with air located on the lung). Cysts mainly located in the lower lung are more likely to be found in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome than in patients with LAM or in the group with other lung diseases. In the Birt-Hogg-Dubé group, 18 out of 33 patients have cysts that are mostly near the area between the lungs. All the patients in the LAM group and the group with other lung diseases have cysts in different locations. Cysts that are fusiform (wide in the middle and taper at the ends) are more easily observed in patients in the Birt-Hogg-Dubé group. In total, 58% patients in the Birt-Hogg-Dubé group have less than 50 lung cysts, while all patients in the non-Birt-Hogg-Dubé group had more than 50 lung cysts. The biggest cyst is located in the bottom of the lung in 28 of 33 patients in the Birt-Hogg-Dubé group, while 11 of 33 patients in the LAM group and 10 patients in the other lung diseases group have the biggest cyst in the lower lobe. In conclusion, pulmonary cysts in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé are usually fusiform, are fewer in numbers, and mainly located in the bottom of the lung near the space in between the lungs. The lung images may assist doctors in identifying the difference between Birt-Hogg-Dubé from other lung diseases that have cysts.",
52,24850140,"Turner syndrome is a sex chromosome aneuploidy with characteristic malformations. Amniotic fluid, a complex biological material, could contribute to the understanding of Turner syndrome pathogenesis. In this pilot study, global gene expression analysis of cell-free RNA in amniotic fluid supernatant was utilized to identify specific genes/organ systems that may play a role in Turner syndrome pathophysiology. Cell-free RNA from amniotic fluid of five mid-trimester Turner syndrome fetuses and five euploid female fetuses matched for gestational age was extracted, amplified, and hybridized onto Affymetrix(®) U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Significantly differentially regulated genes were identified using paired t tests. Biological interpretation was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and BioGPS gene expression atlas. There were 470 statistically significantly differentially expressed genes identified. They were widely distributed across the genome. XIST was significantly down-regulated (p < 0.0001); SHOX was not differentially expressed. One of the most highly represented organ systems was the hematologic/immune system, distinguishing the Turner syndrome transcriptome from other aneuploidies we previously studied. Manual curation of the differentially expressed gene list identified genes of possible pathologic significance, including NFATC3, IGFBP5, and LDLR. Transcriptomic differences in the amniotic fluid of Turner syndrome fetuses are due to genome-wide dysregulation. The hematologic/immune system differences may play a role in early-onset autoimmune dysfunction.

Methods: The study comprised of 350 children with recurrent streptococcal tonsillitis, 284 of whom completed the study and 162 children received conventional surgical treatment. The rest of the children, 122, were divided randomly into two equal main groups. Group A children received a single intramuscular BP (600,000 IU for children≤27kg and 1,200,000IU for ≥27kg) every two weeks for six months. Group B children received single oral AZT (250mg for children≤25kg and 500mg for ≥25kg) once weekly for six months. Results: Both groups showed marked significant reduction in recurrent tonsillitis that is comparable to results of tonsillectomy. There were no statistical differences between group A and B regarding the recurrence of infections and drug safety after six-month follow-up. Group B showed better compliance. Conclusion: AZT proved to be good alternative to BP in the management of recurrent tonsillitis with results similar to those obtained after tonsillectomy.","Our objective is to compare two antibiotics, azithromycin (AZT) and benzathine penicillin (BP), in treating reoccurring inflamed tonsils in children. 284 of 350 children with reoccurring inflamed tonsils caused by strep bacteria participated in the study. 162 children had surgery to treat reoccurring inflamed tonsils.

11,7853374,"Treatment of PDH deficiency rarely influences the course of the disease. It is usually possible to reverse or minimize systemic lactic acid accumulation by giving a high fat/low carbohydrate ""ketogenic"" diet, but this does not alleviate the neurological symptoms as structural damage in the brain is present from before birth and many patients do not have significant metabolic problems. There is some evidence that dichloroacetate (which inhibits the specific PDH kinase and thereby activates any residual functioning complex) will also reduce the metabolic disturbance in some patients, but, again, this is rarely accompanied by any objective improvement in neurological performance. A more favorable outcome can be expected in the extremely rare patients with a thiamine responsive form of the disease and, for this reason, a short therapeutic trial of thiamine is worth trying in all cases.","Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency or shortage is a rare disorder caused by genetic changes, and its progression can rarely be stopped by treatment.

13,30793493,"Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are associated. This study investigated the impact of AF intervention on 6-month home sleep testing data. Methods: Sixty-seven patients (aged 66 to 86, 53% male) with persistent AF were randomized (1:1:1) to direct current cardioversion (DCCV) (22 patients), permanent pacemaker (PPM) + atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) + DCCV (22 patients) or AF ablation (23 patients). Baseline and 6-month multichannel home sleep tests with the Watch-PAT200 (Itamar Medical Lts., Caesarea, Israel) were recorded. Implantable cardiac monitors (ICMs) (Medtronic Reveal XT, Minneapolis, Minnesota) in the DCCV and AF ablation groups, and PPM Holters in the 'pace and ablate' group were utilized to assess cardiac rhythm beat-to-beat throughout the study period. Results: The prevalence of moderate-to-severe SDB [apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) ≥ 15/h] was 60%. At 6 months there was no change in AHI, Epworth sleepiness scale, sleep time, % REM sleep, respiratory desaturation index or central apnoeic events. Twenty-five patients (15 AF ablation, 9 DCCV and 1 following DCCV post-AVNA) maintained SR at 6 months confirmed on ICMs in these patients. AHI fell from 29.8 ± 26.6/h to 22.2 ± 20.4/h; P = 0.049. Conclusions: SDB is highly prevalent in patients with persistent AF. Restoration of sinus rhythm, and the associated long-term recovery of haemodynamics, is associated with a significant reduction in AHI. This implicates reversal of fluid shift from the lower limbs to the neck region, a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of SDB.","Sleep-disordered breathing and irregular heart beats are linked. This study examines irregular heart beat treatment on 6-month home sleep testing data. Sixty-seven patients (aged 66 to 86, 53% male) with long-lasting atrial fibrillation (irregular or rapid heart beat) were randomly grouped (1:1:1) to three standard treatments for atrial fibrillation.  The presence of moderate-to-severe sleep-disordered breathing [number of breathing interruptions during sleep ≥ 15/h] was 60%. At 6 months, there was no change in sleep-disordered breathing measurements. Twenty-five patients (with standard treatments for irregular heart beat) maintained sinus rhythm for 6 months confirmed on implanted heart beat monitors in these patients. Number of breathing interruptions during sleep fell from 29.8 ± 26.6/h to 22.2 ± 20.4/h. Sleep-disordered breathing is very present in patients with lasting irregular heart beats. Recovery of sinus rhythm, and the linked long-term recovery of blood flow, is linked with a noticeable reduction in the number of breathing interruptions during sleep. These fewer breathing interruptions during sleep imply reversal of fluid shift from the lower limbs to the neck region, which is key for causing sleep-disordered breathing.","There are associations between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts, and atrial fibrillation (AF), an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm that can lead to blood clots in the heart. This study investigates the impact of AF interventions and treatments on 6-month home sleep testing data. Sixty-seven patients with persistent (lasting longer than 7 days) atrial fibrillation were randomly put in 3 different treatment groups: 1) cardioversion (a procedure used to return an irregular or very fast heartbeat to a normal rhythm), 2) permanent pacemaker (a small device that is inserted under the skin of the chest to help the heart beat normally) with atrioventricular node ablation (heat energy to destroy a small amount of tissue between the upper and lower chambers of your heart) with cardioversion, or 3) AF ablation (using small burns or freezes to cause some scarring on the inside of the heart to help break up the electrical signals that cause irregular heartbeats). Home sleep tests were recorded at the start of the study and at 6 months. Other devices were used to monitor heart rhythm throughout the study period. The occurrence of moderate-to-severe SBD, that measured over 15 for apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), the number of breathing pauses or disruptions per hour while asleep, was found in more than half (60%) of patients. At six months there was no change in AHI, sleepiness during the day, sleep time, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and other tests that measure sleep and breathing patterns. At 6 months, 25 patients (15 from the AF ablation group) had a steady sinus rhythm, the pattern of your heartbeat based on the sinus node of your heart which sends out electrical pulses. AHI fell from 29.8 ± 26.6/h to 22.2 ± 20.4/h. In conclusion, sleep-disordered breathing is very common in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. Restoration of sinus rhythm, and the associated long-term recovery of normal heart function, is associated with a large reduction in AHI. This finding suggests that reversing fluid from the lower limbs to the neck area is a key process in the development of sleep-disordered breathing."
30,33368332,"Diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) cases is based on the count of real-time reverse transcription-plymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive people. Viral load by real-time RT-PCR has been suggested as a biomarker of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the association of viral load and severity of the disease is not yet resolved. Nasopharyngeal samples from 458 patients were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Relative quantitation was made by the comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCt ) formula between ORF1ab viral and RNase P housekeeping genes. Absolute viral load was calculate using a reference positive control. Most prevalent clinical signs were cough (75.8%), myalgia (66.7%), and fever (48.5%). Hypertension (18.2%), neurological diseases (15.1%), and asthma and hypothyroidism (12.1%) were most frequent comorbidities. Fever, either as an exclusive symptom or combined with others, was associated with high viral loads ( 2−ΔΔCt range, 35.65-155.16; 4.25-4.89 log10 RNA copies/test]). During the first week after onset of symptoms in mild patients up to 60 years-old was detected the peak of viral load. Children under 10 years old have a high viral load (313.84; 2.50) in the first 2 days postinfection with a sharp decline thereafter. Cases between 10 and 49 years old mostly showed low and moderate viral load during the first 2 days postinfection (range, 0.03 to 17.24; -1.50 to 1.24). Patients over 60 years old have high viral load up to the second week after the onset of symptoms (range, 25.32-155.42; 1.40-2.19), indicating the longer presence of the virus in them. These findings suggest the viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs would help to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 infection in mild coronavirus disease 2019 cases.","Diagnosis of cases of coronavirus (a virus causing the lung infection known as Covid-19) is based on the count of positive RT-PCR tests, a type of test that looks for traces of DNA from the virus and signals positive if there is virus present. The amount of virus in the body, called the viral load, measured by the RT-PCR test is seen as an indication of coronavirus infection. However, the association of the amount of virus and the severity of the disease is not yet understood. Samples from the back of the nose from 458 patients are tested by RT-PCR for coronavirus. Additional tests are done to measure the viral load. The most common signs are cough, muscle aches and pains, and fever. High blood pressure, diseases affecting the brain and nerves, asthma, and hypothyroidism (not enough thyroid hormone in the body) were the most frequent conditions of other illnesses. Fever, either as the only symptom or combined with others, is associated with high viral loads. During the first week after symptoms start in mild patients up to 60 years-old is the peak of viral load. Children under 10 years old have a high viral load in the first 2 days post-infection followed by a sharp decline. Cases between 10 and 49 years old mostly showed low and moderate viral load during the first 2 days after infection. Patients over 60 years old have high viral load up to the second week after the start of symptoms, indicating the virus stays present in them longer. These findings suggest the viral load in swabs from the nose would help to monitor the coronavirus infection in mild coronavirus disease 2019 cases.","Detecting cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), which causes a breathing-related viral disease, is based on the count of people which a certain molecular test (real-time RT-PCR) detects. Viral amount by real-time RT-PCR may be a signal of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the link between viral amount and severity of the disease is unknown. Nasal samples from 458 patients were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.  Most common symptoms were cough (75.8%), muscle pain (66.7%), and fever (48.5%). High blood pressure (18.2%), brain-related diseases (15.1%), and asthma and reduced thyroid function, which affects metabolism, (12.1%) were the most frequent associated conditions. Fever, either alone or with other symptoms, was linked with a high virus amount. The peak of the virus amount was detected in the first week after symptoms started in mild patients up to 60 years-old. Children under 10 years have a high virus amount in the first 2 days after infection with a sharp decline after. Cases between 10 and 49 years mostly showed low to medium virus amount during the first 2 days after infection. Patients over 60 years have a high virus amount up to the second week after symptoms start, indicating the longer presence of the virus in them. The virus amount in nasal swabs may help monitor the SARS-CoV-2 infection in cases of mild coronavirus disease 2019, a breathing-related viral disease."
24,10901839,"This multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and consequences of progressive or abrupt withdrawal of clobazam in the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder in a double blind study in comparison to lorazepam and buspirone. 128 outpatients suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder according to DMS III criteria were included in the study and treated for three weeks. They were randomly divided into 4 groups: group 1: 32 patients receiving clobazam, abruptly withdrawn and replaced by a placebo; group 2: 29 patients receiving clobazam with progressive withdrawal over 3 weeks, clobazam being replaced by a placebo; group 3: 33 patients receiving lorazepam with progressive withdrawal over 3 weeks, lorazepam being replaced by a placebo; group 4: 34 patients receiving buspirone, abruptly withdrawn and replaced by a placebo. The dosages were increased progressively during the first week of treatment. At the end of this time, the patients received either 30 mg clobazam or 30 mg buspirone or 3 mg lorazepam daily. After the first week, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) showed a significant improvement in clobazam and lorazepam groups but not in buspirone group. All the drugs were equally effective after three weeks of treatment. The anti-anxiety activity persisted after withdrawal of the studied drug in the 4 groups, without any signs of rebound anxiety or withdrawal syndrome. No clinically relevant differences were found between the 4 groups regarding safety. The side-effects reported were mainly drowsiness in clobazam and lorazepam groups, nausea and headache in buspirone group. In conclusion, clobazam like lorazepam improved anxiety more quickly than buspirone; after 3 weeks of therapy, efficacy was comparable with the 3 drugs and persisted after treatment discontinuation.","We rated the effectiveness and effects of gradual or fast withdrawal of clobazam (a benzodiazepine which helps treat anxiety) in treating generalized anxiety disorder compared to lorazepam and buspirone, other anxiety-treating drugs. 128 patients with generalized anxiety disorder based on the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders participated in the study and received treatment for three weeks. We divided patients into 4 groups: 32 patients taking clobazam, quickly withdrawn and replaced with sugar pills; group 2: 29 patients taking clobazam, gradually withdrawn over 3 weeks and replaced with sugar pills; group 3: 33 patients taking lorazepam, gradually withdrawn over 3 weeks and replaced with sugar pills; group 4: 34 patients taking buspirone, quickly withdrawn and replaced with sugar pills. The amount taken was increased gradually during the first week of treatment. At the end of this time, the patients took either 30 mg clobazam, 30 mg buspirone, or 3 mg lorazepam every day. After the first week, a common questionnaire measuring severity of anxiety symptoms showed improvement in people taking clobazam and lorazepam but not in people taking buspirone. All the drugs worked equally well after three weeks of treatment. The anti-anxiety effects lasted after withdrawal of the studied drug in the 4 groups, with no signs of anxiety symptoms returning or withdrawal symptoms. We found no relevant difference in safety between the 4 groups. Drowsiness in patients taking clobazam and lorazepam and nausea and headache in patients taking buspirone were the main side effects reported. We conclude that clobazam, like lorazepam, improved anxiety more quickly than buspirone; after 3 weeks of treatment, effectiveness of the 3 drugs was similar and lasted after patients stopped taking the drugs.",
6,29381251,"Objective: Hypothyroidism is relatively common, occurring in approximately 5% of the general US population aged ≥12 years. Levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy is the standard of care. Approximately, 5%-10% of patients who normalise thyroid-stimulating hormone levels with LT4 monotherapy may have persistent symptoms that patients and clinicians may attribute to hypothyroidism. A long-standing debate in the literature is whether addition of levotriiodothyronine (LT3) to LT4 will ameliorate lingering symptoms. Here, we explore the evidence for and against LT4/LT3 combination therapy as the optimal approach to treat euthyroid patients with persistent complaints. Methods: Recent literature indexed on PubMed was searched in March 2017 using the terms ""hypothyroid"" or ""hypothyroidism"" and ""triiodothyronine combination"" or ""T3 combination."" Relevant non-review articles published in English during the past 10 years were included and supplemented with articles already known to the authors. Findings: Current clinical evidence is not sufficiently strong to support LT4/LT3 combination therapy in patients with hypothyroidism. Polymorphisms in deiodinase genes that encode the enzymes that convert T4 to T3 in the periphery may provide potential mechanisms underlying unsatisfactory treatment results with LT4 monotherapy. However, results of studies on the effect of LT4/LT3 therapy on clinical symptoms and thyroid-responsive genes have thus far not been conclusive. Conclusions: Persistent symptoms in patients who are biochemically euthyroid with LT4 monotherapy may be caused by several other conditions unrelated to thyroid function, and their cause should be aggressively investigated by the clinician.","Low thyroid function occurs in around 5% of the US population aged ≥12 years. Levothyroxine (LT4) (a thyroid hormonal drug) is standard treatment. Around 5-10% of patients with regular thyroid-stimulating hormone levels after LT4 may still have symptoms attributable to reduced thyroid funciton. Experts debate if adding levotriiodothyronine (LT3), another manmade thyroid hormone, to LT4 will help lingering symptoms. We explore evidence for and against LT4/LT3 double treatment for best treating patients with lingering thyroid issues. We searched PubMed in March 2017 using the terms ""hypothyroid"" or ""hypothyroidism"" (low thyroid function) and ""triiodothyronine combination"" or ""T3 combination"" (thyroid hormonal drug therapy). Current evidence does not support LT4/LT3 double treatment for those with reduced thyroid function. Variations in genes blueprinting enzymes that convert thyroid hormone from one form to another may explain the lack of improvement with LT4 treatment. However, studies of LT4/LT3 double treatment are not conclusive. Lingering symptoms in patients with normal thyroids from LT4 therapy may be from other thyroid-unrelated causes, which should be investigated by the clinician.","Underactive thyroid is relatively common, occurring in about 5% of the general U.S. population 12 years and older. The recommended treatment is a single drug, levothyroxine (LT4 - a common thyroid medication). About 5%-10% of patients who use LT4 alone to regulate thyroid-stimulating hormone levels may have ongoing symptoms that patients and doctors may think are caused by underactive thyroid. Science disagrees as to whether addition of levotriiodothyronine (LT3 - another thryoid medication) to LT4 will improve these ongoing symptoms. We look at whether combining LT4 and LT3 is the best way to treat patients with normal thyroid function but ongoing symptoms. We searched PubMed in March 2017 using the terms ""hypothyroid"" or ""hypothyroidism"" and ""triiodothyronine combination"" or ""T3 combination."" We looked at English articles in the last 10 years in addition to known articles. We did not find strong proof that combining LT4 and LT3 worked to treat patients with underactive thyroids. Genes that cause less conversion of T4 to T3 may explain unsuccessful treatment with LT4. The benefit of adding LT3 to LT4 treatment is uncertain. Ongoing symptoms in patients with normal thyroid function may be due to other causes. A doctor should determine the cause of the ongoing symptoms."
12,2686220,"Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) as the main condition for the development of asthma may be modulated either by intrinsic or by extrinsic stimuli as well as by climatic and meteorologic factors. Proinflammatory mediators in combination with alterations of airway mucosa induce or amplify BHR. Upper airway viral infections, exposure to allergens in atopic subjects, chronic hyperplastic changes of the upper airways, airway irritants and analgesics are supposed to be the most likely asthma triggers in predisposed children and adults. There is the suggestion that BHR can be improved not only by treatment with steroidal and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs but also by maritime climatotherapy. The latter could be the result not only of the reduction of inhalative irritants, e.g. of allergen concentration, but also by the involvement or more complex mechanisms. Possible theoretic approaches and hypotheses regarding the mode of action of maritime climatic cures are discussed. First preliminary results obtained in a mediterranean region have demonstrated a negative impact of metereologic events like passages of cold weather fronts or increase of wind velocity on the course of asthma disease. An improvement of BHR assessed by histamine challenge test has been observed at the end of climatotherapy in the Baltic sea area. Prospective studies about asthma prevention in subjects at risk with BHR and atopy that have been starting should contribute to the evaluation of the therapeutic effects and the prognostic importance of maritime climatotherapy for getting exact scientific indications for climatotherapy in patients with bronchial asthma.","Bronchial hypperresponsiveness (increased lung sensitivity to airway-narrowing particles) or BHR as the main reason for developing asthma (a disease restricting breathing) may be modified by internal or external causes and environmental factors. Proinflammatory particles with changes to throat mucus promote BHR. Upper airway viral infections, allergen exposure, lasting enlargement of upper airways, airway irritants and pain-relievers may be the most common triggers of asthma in susceptible people. BHR may be improved by treatment with antiinflammatory drugs and coastal weather. Improvement with coastal weather may be because of reduced inhalative irritants and more complex reasons. Possible ideas regarding the means of coastal weather cures are explored. First, initial results from a mediterranean region show a negative effect of weather events like cold weather or faster wind speeds on the progression of asthma. BHR improvement measured by lung response tests has been observed after weather therapy in the Baltic sea area. Future studies about preventing asthma in people prone to BHR and allergy development should help with evaluating treatment effects and the importance of coastal weather therapy for those with bronchial asthma.","Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is an increase in sensitivity to different things that cause the airway to narrow. When BHR is the main cause of developing asthma, BHR may be adjusted by internal and external factors as well as by climate and meterologic (atmosphere, humidity, wind, temperature) factors. Inflammation that can make the disease worse, combined with changes in the mucus of airways, brings on or increases bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Viral infections in the upper airway (the nose, nasal cavity, and pharynx or throat area), exposure to allergens in people with tendencies to have an allergy, long-lasting hyperplastic changes (extra cell growth) of the upper airways, irritants (substances that cause discomfort) and pain drugs in the airways are seen as the most likely asthma triggers in vulnerable children and adults. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) may be improved with steroid (man-made drugs with a synthetic hormone) and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (drugs that relieve pain) and with maritime climatotherapy, where a patient is relocated to a different location close to the sea for health reasons. Maritime climatotherapy may improve BHR by reducing the level of irritants inhaled from the air. How maritime climatic cures work are discussed. Metereological (weather) events such as cold weather fronts have shown a negative impact on how asthma disease progresses. An improvement of BHR is observed at the end of climatotherapy using the histamine challenge test, which tests how sensitive airways are to irritants. Future studies on asthma prevention in patients at risk with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and atopy (allergies) should evaluate the effects and importance of maritime climatotherapy."

He was started on gabapentin, 300mg twice daily for his back pain and anxiety symptoms. His only other medication was hydrocodone. Over next few days, he started developing worsening bilateral lower extremity edema. He did not have any cardiovascular related symptoms. Physical exam was only significant for 3+ pitting edema with all laboratory values and imaging being unremarkable. Gabapentin was discontinued and his lower extremity swelling improved over subsequent days. Incidence of pedal edema with gabapentin use is approximately 7 to 7.5% with all studies being in elderly patients receiving doses above 1200 mg/day. This case illustrates that lower doses of gabapentin can also cause this adverse effect. It is important to recognize this adverse effect because gabapentin is used in conditions like diabetic neuropathy, which is associated with multiple co-morbidities that can give rise to bilateral leg swelling. Presence of gabapentin induced leg swelling can thus confound the clinical picture.","A 46 year old male with past medical history of schizoaffective (reality-distorting) disorder, a mental disorder, and chronic lower back pain, is admitted to a medical facility to manage worsening depression and anxiety.

Over the next few days, he starts developing worsening edema, swelling caused by too much fluid trapped in the body's tissues, in both legs. He does not have any cardiovascular (heart) related symptoms. A physical exam found pitting edema, where pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation. All other lab tests and imaging scans did not show anything significant. Gabapentin is stopped and the swelling in his legs improved over the following days. In other studies, the occurrence of swollen feet (pedal edema) while on gabapentin is about 7 to 7.5% in elderly patients receiving doses above 1200 mg/day. This case illustrates that lower doses of gabapentin can also cause this negative effect.

18,1770194,"The extent to which given levels of caloric restriction will improve glycemic status but increase plasma ketone bodies in gestational diabetic women has received little attention. After reviewing the underlying physiology, we present data on two feeding studies investigating the question. In the first, a weight-maintaining approximately 2400-kcal/day diet was fed on a metabolic ward to 12 gestational diabetic women for 1 week. In the second week, subjects were randomized to a continuation of the 2400-kcal/day diet or to a 1200-kcal/day diet. Twenty-four-hour mean glucose levels remained unchanged in the control group but declined in the calorie-restricted group (6.7 mM or 121 mg/dl in week 1 vs 5.4 mM or 97.3 mg/dl in week 2) (p less than 0.01). Nine-hour overnight fasting plasma insulin also declined but oral glucose tolerance did not improve with caloric restriction. Fasting plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate rose in the calorie-restricted group, along with an increase in ketonuria, but not in the control group. A second study compared the impact of a 33% calorie-restricted diet or insulin to a full-calorie diet in a similar 2-week experimental design and measured hepatic glucose output and insulin sensitivity with dideuterated glucose before and during an insulin clamp. Diet in three subjects improved fasting and 24-hr mean glucose by 22 and 10%, respectively, whereas prophylactic insulin in three subjects produced 0 and 4% reductions, respectively. On average, ketonuria after a 9-hr fast declined to an equivalent degree with both treatments. Hepatic glucose output and insulin sensitivity were not statistically significantly altered by gestational diabetes or the therapeutic interventions compared to nondiabetic normal weight or obese pregnant controls. In conclusion, 50% caloric restriction improves glycemic status in obese women with gestational diabetes but is associated with an increase in ketonuria, which is of uncertain significance. An intermediate 33% level of caloric restriction (to 1600-1800 kcal daily) may be more appropriate in dietary management of obese woman with gestational diabetes mellitus and more effective than prophylactic insulin. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.","How much caloric restriction (reducing the amount of calories consumed) will improve glycemic status (blood sugar levels) but increase ketone bodies (substances that the body makes if the cells don't get enough blood sugar) in gestational diabetic women (women diagnosed with diabetes for the first time during pregnancy) has received little attention. Data are presented on two studies that monitor and control diets to investigate these questions. In the first study, a diet of 2,400 calories per day is provided to 12 gestational diabetic women for 1 week. In the second week, patients were randomly assigned to either continue the 2,400 calories per day diet or to a 1,200 calories per day diet. The average glucose (blood sugar) levels remained unchanged in the 2,400 calorie diet group but declined in the lower calorie group that had a 1,200 calories per day diet. After fasting (no food) for 9 hours overnight, insulin (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood) also declined, but oral glucose tolerance (a test that measures how the body moves sugar from blood to the tissues) did not improve with the reduced calories diet. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (a chemical in the body that provides energy when not enough carbohydrates or sugars have been eaten) increased in the reduced calorie group, along with an increase in ketonuria, high amounts of ketones (substances that your body makes if your cells don't get enough blood sugar) in the urine, but not in the comparison group that had the 2,400 calorie diet. A second study compared the impact of a calorie-restricted diet reduced by 33% or insulin to a full-calorie diet in a similar 2 week experiment. The study measured liver production of sugar and insulin sensitivity with labeled glucose before and during an insulin clamp (used to maintain glucose levels). Diet in 3 patients improved fasting and average glucose levels. Prophylactic insulin (insulin administered to the patient) in 3 people also produced smaller reductions. On average, ketonuria after a 9 hour fast declined in the same amount with both treatments. Liver glucose production and insulin sensitivity were not significantly changed by gestational diabetes or the treatments compared to normal weight or obese pregnant women who did not have diabetes. In conclusion, reducing calories by half improves blood sugar levels in obese women with gestational diabetes but is connected with an increase in high amounts of ketones in the urine, which is of uncertain significance. Reducing calories by 33% (to 1,600 - 1,800 calories daily) may be better in diet management of obese women with gestational diabetes mellitus and more effective than prophylactic insulin. More studies are required to confirm these results.",
13,30571183,"Background: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) can be caused by gain-of-function mutations in genes, encoding the cardiac potassium channel subunits KCNJ2, KCNE1, and KCNH2 that mediate the repolarizing potassium currents Ik1, Iks, and Ikr, respectively. Methods: Linkage analysis, whole-exome sequencing, and Xenopus oocyte electrophysiology studies were used in this study. Results: Through genetic studies, we showed that autosomal dominant early-onset nocturnal paroxysmal AF is caused by p.S447R mutation in KCND2, encoding the pore-forming (α) subunit of the Kv4.2 cardiac potassium channel. Kv4.2, along with Kv4.3, contributes to the cardiac fast transient outward K+ current, Ito. Ito underlies the early phase of repolarization in the cardiac action potential, thereby setting the initial potential of the plateau phase and governing its duration and amplitude. In Xenopus oocytes, the mutation increased the channel's inactivation time constant and affected its regulation: p.S447 resides in a protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site, which normally allows attenuation of Kv4.2 membrane expression. The mutant Kv4.2 exhibited impaired response to PKC; hence, Kv4.2 membrane expression was augmented, enhancing potassium currents. Coexpression of mutant and wild-type channels (recapitulating heterozygosity in affected individuals) showed results similar to the mutant channel alone. Finally, in a hybrid channel composed of Kv4.3 and Kv4.2, simulating the mature endogenous heterotetrameric channel underlying Ito, the p.S447R Kv4.2 mutation exerted a gain-of-function effect on Kv4.3. Conclusions: The mutation alters Kv4.2's kinetic properties, impairs its inhibitory regulation, and exerts gain-of-function effect on both Kv4.2 homotetramers and Kv4.2-Kv4.3 heterotetramers. These effects presumably increase the repolarizing potassium current Ito, thereby abbreviating action potential duration, creating arrhythmogenic substrate for nocturnal AF. Interestingly, Kv4.2 expression was previously shown to demonstrate circadian variation, with peak expression at daytime in murine hearts (human nighttime), with possible relevance to the nocturnal onset of paroxysmal AF symptoms in our patients. The atrial-specific phenotype suggests that targeting Kv4.2 might be effective in the treatment of nocturnal paroxysmal AF, avoiding adverse ventricular effects.","Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) (an irregular heart rate that returns to normal within 7 days on its own or with treatment) can be caused by mutations in genes. Genetic linkage analysis to trace diseases in families using genes, whole-exome sequencing to find a genetic cause of a disease, and models to study biological processes of cells were used in this study. Through these genetic studies, researchers show that one genetic trait or mutation that is passed down from parent to child causing nighttime paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is caused by a mutation in the KCND2 gene. Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 are potassium channels that release potassium from cells and contribute to the heart-related, temporary, fast, outward potassium (K+) current, Ito. Ito is the base of the early phase of repolarization (when the outward current of ions exceeds the inward current) in the cardiac action potental (where unique properties necessary for function of the electrical conduction system of the heart occur), and creates the initial potential of the plateau phase (the time that allows for longer muscle contraction and allows the heart to contract in a steady, uniform, and forceful manner). In studies that modeled the cell's biology, the mutation increased the potassium channel's inactivation time (the time when the channel no longer allows potassium to be passed through it) and affected its regulation. The mutant Kv4.2 showed an impaired response to protein kinase C (PKC), a protein that regulates cells growth and plays a major role in sending signals to the heart.  The gene mutation alters Kv4.2's transfer properties, impairs its regulation process, and exerts gain-of-function effect (changes the activity or function of a protein) in both Kv4.2 and Kv4.2-Kv4.3 potassium channels. These effects possibly increase the repolarizing potassium current Ito, creating arrhythmogenic substrates (factors that can produce or lead to arrhythmia) for nocturnal atrial fibrillation (an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm occuring at night that can lead to blood clots in the heart). Kv4.2 expression has previously been shown to demonstrate circadian variation (the natural, internal process that regulates the sleep–wake cycle and repeats roughly every 24 hours), with peak expression at daytime, with possible relevance to the nighttime onset of symptoms of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rate that returns to normal within 7 days on its own or with treatment) in patients. Targeting Kv4.2 might be effective in the treatment of nocturnal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.",
26,32771633,"Objectives: The distribution of the transmission onset of COVID-19 relative to the symptom onset is a key parameter for infection control. It is often not easy to study the transmission onset time, as it is difficult to know who infected whom exactly when. Methods: We inferred transmission onset time from 72 infector-infectee pairs in South Korea, either with known or inferred contact dates, utilizing the incubation period. Combining this data with known information of the infector's symptom onset, we could generate the transmission onset distribution of COVID-19, using Bayesian methods. Serial interval distribution could be automatically estimated from our data. Results: We estimated the median transmission onset to be 1.31 days (standard deviation, 2.64 days) after symptom onset with a peak at 0.72 days before symptom onset. The pre-symptomatic transmission proportion was 37% (95% credible interval [CI], 16-52%). The median incubation period was estimated to be 2.87 days (95% CI, 2.33-3.50 days), and the median serial interval to be 3.56 days (95% CI, 2.72-4.44 days). Conclusions: Considering that the transmission onset distribution peaked with the symptom onset and the pre-symptomatic transmission proportion is substantial, the usual preventive measures might be too late to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Understanding when a potential COVID-19 patient is contagious in relation to when they first show symptoms is important to help reduce the spread of the virus. Is it not easy to determine COVID-19 transmission duration, or how long the virus was spread, as it is difficult to trace who had contact with who. The goal of this paper was to determine COVID-19 transmission by evaluating 72 infector-infected pairs from South Korea, with known or estimated contact dates, by reviewing the pairs' incubation period. The incubation period is a time between the date of exposure and the first day of virus related symptoms. Using this data in comparison with the confirmed date of the infector's first day of symptoms, the authors aim to estimate when an infected person first becomes contagious (able to spread the virus). The time between the date of infection and the time a person is capable of spreading COVID-19 to others could be predicted. The estimated average time of COVID-19 spreading to others after a patient first shows symptoms was 1.31 days. However, the peak of transmissibility was 0.72 days before symptoms appear. The amount of cases that displayed patients who could spread the virus before they started showing symptoms accounted for 37% of the 72 reviewed cases. The average time between COVID-19 entering a person's body (time of exposure) and the onset of symptoms was 2.87 days. This paper has shown that ability of a person to spread COVID-19 was highest at the time symptoms first occurred. Additionally, it has been demonstrated a large portion of the population is able to spread the virus even before symptoms occur. Because of this, the usual measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 may not be enough to improve public health.",
32,18200034,"Recent studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs like diuretics increase plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels. However, the effect of other antihypertensive drugs on plasma Hcy levels has not been tested extensively. The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of antihypertensive therapy (AHT) on Hcy levels in essential hypertensive subjects. A case-control study of 273 patients with essential hypertension (EH) and 103 normotensive controls was undertaken. Plasma Hcy levels were measured before and after 6 weeks of AHT. The genotyping of MTHFR C677T polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers significantly decreased and hydrochlorothiazides significantly increased the plasma Hcy levels in hypertensive patients (P<0.05). No significant association between MTHFR C677T genotypes and changes in Hcy levels in response to antihypertensive was observed in EH patients. The decrease in Hcy induced by beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors observed in our study may be due to the improvement of endothelial function along with improved renal function. Thus, our results suggest that ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may provide additional beneficial therapeutic effects to the EH patients by decreasing Hcy levels.","Recent studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs (that treat high blood pressure), like diuretics, increase plasma or blood homocysteine (Hcy) levels. Hcy is am amino acid that creates other chemicals your body needs. However, the effect of other antihypertensive drugs on plasma Hcy levels has not been tested extensively. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of antihypertensive therapy (AHT) on Hcy levels in essential hypertensive subjects. Essential hypertensive patients have high blood pressure that is not the result of a medical condition. A study of 273 patients with essential hypertension (EH) and 103 patients with normal blood pressure was begun. Plasma Hcy levels were measured before and after 6 weeks of AHT. Patients were genotyped to analyze a specific genetic variation or gene material. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are drugs that lower blood pressure by relaxing veins and arteries. Beta-blockers are drugs that lower blood pressure by blocking the effects of adrenaline. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers significantly decrease plasms Hcy levels in hypertensive patients. Hydrochlorothiazides, or ""water pills"", significantly increase plasms Hcy levels in hypertensive patients. There was no association between the identified genetic variation and changes in Hcy levels in response to antihypertensive within EH patients. The observed decrease in Hcy caused by ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may be due to the improvement of endothelial (tissue lining various organs and cavities in the body) and kidney function. Therefore, this study suggests that ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may provide additional, beneficial or therapeutic effects to the EH patients by decreasing Hcy levels.",
51,25482141,"Objective: Obese youth clinically diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently have evidence of islet cell autoimmunity (proteins made against insulin-producing cells). We investigated the clinical and biochemical differences, and therapeutic modalities among autoantibody positive (Ab+) vs. autoantibody negative (Ab-) youth at the time of diagnosis and over time in a multi-provider clinical setting. Study design: Chart review of 145 obese youth diagnosed with T2DM from January 2003 to July 2012. Of these, 70 patients were Ab+ and 75 Ab-. The two groups were compared with respect to clinical presentation, physical characteristics, laboratory data, and therapeutic modalities at diagnosis and during follow up to assess the changes in these parameters associated with disease progression. Results: At presentation, Ab+ youth with a clinical diagnosis of T2DM were younger, had higher rates of ketosis, higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose levels, and lower insulin and c-peptide concentrations compared with the Ab- group. The Ab- group had a higher body mass index (BMI) z-score and cardiometabolic risk factors at diagnosis and such difference remained over time. Univariate analysis revealed that treatment modality had no effect on BMI in either group. Generalized estimating equations for longitudinal data analysis revealed that (i) BMI z-score and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly affected by duration of diabetes; (ii) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and ALT were affected by changes in BMI z-score; and (iii) changes in HbA1c had an effect on lipid profile and cardiometabolic risk factors regardless of antibody status. Conclusions: Irrespective of antibody status and treatment modality, youth who present with obesity and diabetes, show no improvement in obesity status over time, with the deterioration in BMI z-score affecting blood pressure (BP) and ALT, but the lipid profile being mostly impacted by HbA1c and glycemic control. Effective control of BMI and glycemia are needed to lessen the future macrovascular complications irrespective of antibody status.","Obese youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by a doctor often have islet cell autoimmunity (in which immune cells attack healthy cells). We looked at the observable and biochemical differences, and treatment types of self-made protein positive (Ab+) vs. self-made protein negative (Ab-) youth at diagnosis and over time at a medical facility. We reviewed medical charts of 145 obese youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes from January 2003 to July 2012. Of these 145 youth, 70 patients were Ab+ and 75 Ab-. We compared the disease symptoms, physical qualities, lab findings, and treatment types of the two groups at diagnosis and during follow up to rate the changes in these things related to disease development. At the doctor, Ab+ youth with a doctor's diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were younger, had higher rates of not enough carbohydrates to burn, higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c - which indicates average blood sugar levels) and blood sugar levels, and lower insulin and signs of insulin production compared with the Ab- group. The Ab- group had a higher body mass index (BMI) score adjusted for weight and gender and risk factors for heart disease and metabolic disorders at diagnosis and did not change over time. Treatment type had no effect on BMI in either group. We found that: (i) length of diabetes affected BMI score adjusted for weight and gender and diastolic blood pressure, (ii) changes In BMI score adjusted for weight and gender affected systolic blood pressure and ALT (alanine transaminase; released into the blood when liver cells are damaged), and (iii) changes in HbA1c affected lipid profile (panel of blood tests used to find abnormalities in lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides) and risk factors for heart disease and metabolic disorders independent of antibody (infection-fighting protein) status. Regardless of antibody status and treatment type, obese and diabetic youth do not become less obese over time, with higher BMI affecting blood pressure and ALT, and blood sugar levels affecting the lipid profile.

52,32210915,"Background: Turner syndrome (TS) is a sex chromosome aneuploidy with a variable spectrum of symptoms including short stature, ovarian failure and skeletal abnormalities. The etiology of TS is complex, and the mechanisms driving its pathogenesis remain unclear. Methods: In our study, we used the online Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray expression profiling dataset GSE46687 to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between monosomy X TS patients and normal female individuals. The relevant data on 26 subjects with TS (45,XO) and 10 subjects with the normal karyotype (46,XX) was investigated. Then, tissue-specific gene expression, functional enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were performed, and the key modules were identified. Results: In total, 25 upregulated and 60 downregulated genes were identified in the differential expression analysis. The tissue-specific gene expression analysis of the DEGs revealed that the system with the most highly enriched tissue-specific gene expression was the hematologic/immune system, followed by the skin/skeletal muscle and neurologic systems. The PPI network analysis, construction of key modules and manual screening of tissue-specific gene expression resulted in the identification of the following five genes of interest: CD99, CSF2RA, MYL9, MYLPF, and IGFBP2. CD99 and CSF2RA are involved in the hematologic/immune system, MYL9 and MYLPF are related to the circulatory system, and IGFBP2 is related to skeletal abnormalities. In addition, several genes of interest with possible roles in the pathogenesis of TS were identified as being associated with the hematologic/immune system or metabolism. Conclusion: This discovery-driven analysis may be a useful method for elucidating novel mechanisms underlying TS. However, more experiments are needed to further explore the relationships between these genes and TS in the future.","Turner syndrome (TS) is a sex chromosome aneuploidy or condition of having abnormal number of chromosomes.

29,32784601,"Objectives: The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) conveys a serious threat globally to health and economy because of a lack of vaccines and specific treatments. A common factor for conditions that predispose for serious progress is a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart failure, to which micronutrient deficiencies may contribute. The aim of the present article was to explore the usefulness of early micronutrient intervention, with focus on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, to relieve escalation of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an online search for articles published in the period 2010-2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and corona and related virus infections. Results: There were a few studies providing direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and COVID-19. Adequate supply of zinc, selenium, and vitamin D is essential for resistance to other viral infections, immune function, and reduced inflammation. Hence, it is suggested that nutrition intervention securing an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate the course of COVID-19. Conclusion: We recommended initiation of adequate supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in high-risk groups should have high priority as regards this nutritive adjuvant therapy, which should be started prior to administration of specific and supportive medical measures.","The new Covid-19 (a viral, respiratory disease) is a serious threat to health and financial stability because of a lack of vaccines and treatments.

There is therefore a pressing need for effective therapies to delay or even avoid the need for surgical repair in TAA patients. Here, we summarize the mechanisms through which NO signalling dysregulation causes TAA, particularly in MFS and discuss recent advances based on the identification of new MFS mediators related to pathway overactivation that represent potential disease biomarkers. Likewise, we propose iNOS, sGC, and PRKG1, whose pharmacological inhibition reverses aortopathy in MFS mice, as targets for therapeutic intervention in TAA and candidates for clinical trials.","Recent studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) is a key mediator (regulator) in diseases occurring with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), such as Marfan syndrome (MFS).

Also there have been update in the evidence-based guidelines for treatment for tardive dyskinesia. Various medication classes are being used for treatment of TD with VMAT2 inhibitors to be first FDA-approved medications. Their use should be tailored to the individual patient. Long-term studies will further guide us in how to optimize treatment, especially in the real-world setting.

30,32840002,"Background: Nucleic acid persists after symptom resolution and infectivity for many viral infections via delayed clearance of nucleic acid fragments, non-infectious particles, or transmissible virus. For Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the relationship between nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positivity, the development of antibodies against COVID-19, and clinical history are unclear. Study design and methods: Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and volunteered to donate convalescent plasma (CP) were screened by NP swab PCR, responded to a questionnaire, and were tested for anti-COVID-19 antibodies. Results: A proportion of 11.8% of individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NP swab PCR greater than 14 days after the resolution of symptoms of active disease, including one donor who had asymptomatic disease and tested positive by NP swab 41 days after her initial diagnosis. Clinical history did not show a significant correlation with persistence of NP swab positivity. Also, NP swab positivity >14 days from symptom resolution did not correlate with anti-COVID-19 serology results. IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody strength correlated with hospitalization for COVID-19 using two different assays. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody strength correlated with time from symptom resolution to sample collection and symptom duration. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is detectable long after the resolution of symptoms in a significant percentage of previously diagnosed individuals, which is important to consider when interpreting PCR swab results. Persistence of PCR positivity does not correlate with antibody strength or symptoms of COVID-19. If anti-spike antibody is used to assess CP potency, individuals who suffered severe COVID-19 disease symptoms may represent better donors.","For many infections from viruses, traces of the infection can remain in the body after symptoms and transmission (or spread) to others stop. For Covid-19 (a viral, respiratory illness), the relationship between a positive (or virus-detected) nasal swab where a sample is taken from the back of the nose and throat, the development of antibodies (proteins in the body) that fight Covid-19, and the clinical history is unclear. In this study, people who recovered from Covid-19 and volunteered to donate plasma (the liquid part of blood) are screened for genetic material of the virus using a nasal swab. These volunteers also answer a series of questions and are tested for Covid-19 antibodies. There are 11.8% who tested positive for coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, using a nasal swab 14 days after symptoms stopped. Medical history does not show a big association with ongoing positive nasal swab tests. Also, a positive nasal swab >14 days after symptoms stop is not correlated with antibodies against Covid-19 in the plasma. A test measuring the increase of antibodies against Covid-19 relates with being in the hospital for Covid-19. Antibodies against Covid-19 corresponded with time after symptoms stopped to when the samples are collected and how long symptoms lasted. In conclusion, traces of genetic material from coronavirus can be found long after symptoms end in a significant percentage of people who have been diagnosed, which is important to remember when reading swab test results. Continuing to test positive does not correspond with antibody strength or symptoms of Covid-19. If measuring antibodies is used to understand plasma strength, individuals who have had serious Covid-19 disease symptoms may be better donors or donators.",
23,34017006,"Phenylketonuria (PKU; also known as phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency) is an autosomal recessive disorder of phenylalanine metabolism, in which especially high phenylalanine concentrations cause brain dysfunction. If untreated, this brain dysfunction results in severe intellectual disability, epilepsy and behavioural problems. The prevalence varies worldwide, with an average of about 1:10,000 newborns. Early diagnosis is based on newborn screening, and if treatment is started early and continued, intelligence is within normal limits with, on average, some suboptimal neurocognitive function. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine has been the mainstay of treatment for over 60 years and has been highly successful, although outcomes are still suboptimal and patients can find the treatment difficult to adhere to. Pharmacological treatments are available, such as tetrahydrobiopterin, which is effective in only a minority of patients (usually those with milder PKU), and pegylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which requires daily subcutaneous injections and causes adverse immune responses. Given the drawbacks of these approaches, other treatments are in development, such as mRNA and gene therapy. Even though PAH deficiency is the most common defect of amino acid metabolism in humans, brain dysfunction in individuals with PKU is still not well understood and further research is needed to facilitate development of pathophysiology-driven treatments.","Phenylketonuria (PKU; also known as phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency or shortage) is a disorder inherited from both parents in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy because it cannot process a molecule (phenylalanine).

There are multiple reports of prolonged viral shedding in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 but the presence of viral RNA on a test does not necessarily correlate with infectivity. The duration of quarantine required after clinical recovery to definitively prevent transmission is therefore uncertain. In addition, asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission may occur, and infectivity may be highest early after onset of symptoms, meaning that contact tracing, isolation of exposed individuals and social distancing are essential public health measures to prevent further spread.

However, the results of COVID-19 tests do not always correlate to the duration of time a person can spread the virus. Meaning a person can test negative but may be actively giving the virus to others unknowingly. Because of this, the duration of time needed before a previously COVID-19 infected person is no longer able to infect others is not known. People without symptoms can spread the virus. COVID-19 can also be spread before people begin to show symptoms. The spread of the virus may actually occur the most right after symptoms show.

45,34692658,"Pressure ulcer (PU) is a worldwide problem that is hard to heal because of its prolonged inflammatory response and impaired ECM deposition caused by local hypoxia and repeated ischemia/reperfusion. Our previous study discovered that the non-fouling zwitterionic sulfated poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (SBMA) hydrogel can improve PU healing with rapid ECM rebuilding. However, the mechanism of the SBMA hydrogel in promoting ECM rebuilding is unclear. Therefore, in this work, the impact of the SBMA hydrogel on ECM reconstruction is comprehensively studied, and the underlying mechanism is intensively investigated in a rat PU model. The in vivo data demonstrate that compared to the PEG hydrogel, the SBMA hydrogel enhances the ECM remolding by the upregulation of fibronectin and laminin expression as well as the inhibition of MMP-2. Further investigation reveals that the decreased MMP-2 expression of zwitterionic SBMA hydrogel treatment is due to the activation of autophagy through the inhibited PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and reduced inflammation. The association of autophagy with ECM remodeling may provide a way in guiding the design of biomaterial-based wound dressing for chronic wound repair.","Bedsores are a worldwide problem that is hard to heal because it causes long-lasting inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) and harms the extracellular matrix (ECM; secreted by cells and surrounds cells in tissues) from not enough oxygen and blood flow.

However, scientists are unsure how SBMA hydrogel rebuilds ECM. In this study, we look at how SBMA hydrogel rebuilds ECM using a rat bedsore model. SMBA hydrogel helps remodel ECM better than PEG hydrogel, another bedsore treatment.

11,31161145,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder associated with abnormal mitochondrial metabolism. Structural brain abnormalities are common in PDCD. A case of a patient with PDCD with an unusual presentation is described. A 20-month-old boy with hypotonia and developmental delay, presented with hypoxia and respiratory distress due to bronchiolitis. During hospitalisation, he was prescribed PediaSure® feeds. Two days after starting these feeds, he developed respiratory arrest requiring intubation. His blood gas before arrest revealed lactate of 8.9 mmol/L despite normal haemodynamics. After stabilisation and a period of compulsory fasting, subsequent feeding with PediaSure® resulted in the recurrence of lactic acidosis. A metabolic workup revealed an elevated serum pyruvate level. Brain MRI was normal. Skeletal muscle biopsy confirmed PDCD. The most common cause of PDCD is a mutation in the X-linked PDHA1 gene.

42,33895124,"Over time, the knowledge on the role of histones has significantly changed. Initially, histones were only known as DNA packaging proteins but later, it was discovered that they act extracellularly as powerful antimicrobial agents and also as potentially self-detrimental agents. Indeed, histones were found to be the most abundant proteins within neutrophil extracellular traps what ultimately highlighted their microbicidal function. In addition, extracellular histones proved to be involved in triggering exacerbated inflammatory and coagulation responses, depending on the cell type affected. Consequently, several investigations were conducted towards studying the potential of histones and their derivatives as either biomarkers or therapeutic target candidates in different diseases in which inflammation and thrombosis have a key pathophysiological role, such as sepsis, thrombosis and different types of cancer. The main objective of this review is to summarize and discuss the current state of the art with regard to both beneficial and harmful roles of histones and also their possible use as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Over time, the knowledge on the role of histones has significantly changed. At first, histones were only known as DNA packaging proteins, but later it was discovered that they act outside of cells as a powerful antimicrobial, an agent that can kill microorganisms or stop their growth. They may also be self-destructive agents. Histones were found to be the most abundant proteins within neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) and highlighted their microbicidal function that kills microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Also, histones outside of cells proved to be involved in triggering worsening inflammatory (the body's natural reaction against injury and infection) and blood clotting responses, depending on the cell type affected. Because of this, several investigations were conducted to study the potential of histones and the substances they may produce as either a sign of a normal or abnormal process in the body (biomarkers or signalers of normal or abnormal processes) or possible ways to use them to fight different diseases. The main objective of this review is to summarize and discuss the most up to date and advanced information on the beneficial and harmful roles of histones and also their possible use as biomarkers and treatments.",

Therapeutic interventions or vaccines are urgently needed to treat and prevent the further dissemination of this contagious virus. This study described the identification of neutralizing receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies from mice through vaccination with a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD. RBD-targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with distinct function and epitope recognition were selected to understand SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. High-affinity RBD-specific antibodies exhibited high potency in neutralizing both live and pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 viruses and the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particle containing the spike protein S-RBDV367F mutant (SARS-CoV-2(V367F)). These results demonstrated that these antibodies recognize four distinct groups (I-IV) of epitopes on the RBD and that mAbs targeting group I epitope can be used in combination with mAbs recognizing groups II and/or IV epitope to make mAb cocktails against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants. Moreover, structural characterization reveals that groups I, III, and IV epitopes are closely located to an RBD hotspot. The identification of RBD-specific antibodies and cocktails may provide an effective therapeutic and prophylactic intervention against SARS-CoV-2 and its isolates.","The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus (the virus that causes COVID-19 or the breathing-related infection) and its variants has created a global public health emergency.

Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. Certain monoclonal antibodies are selected for the study to understand how the coronavirus can be made ineffective. Some antibodies with these receptor-binding domains have a high ability to make the coronavirus ineffective.

35,26458388,"We investigated the value of routine laboratory testing for identifying underlying causes in older men diagnosed with osteoporosis. Most osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic men had ≥1 laboratory abnormality. Few individual laboratory abnormalities were more common in osteoporotic men. The benefit of routine laboratory testing in older osteoporotic men may be low. Introduction: To evaluate the utility of recommended laboratory testing to identify secondary causes in older men with osteoporosis, we examined prevalence of laboratory abnormalities in older men with and without osteoporosis. Methods: One thousand five hundred seventy-two men aged ≥65 years in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men study completed bone mineral density (BMD) testing and a battery of laboratory measures, including serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 25-OH vitamin D, total testosterone, spot urine calcium/creatinine ratio, spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio, creatinine-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate, 24-h urine calcium, and 24-h urine free cortisol. Using cross-sectional analyses, we calculated prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the association of any and specific laboratory abnormalities with osteoporosis and the number of men with osteoporosis needed to test to identify one additional laboratory abnormality compared to testing men without osteoporosis. Results: Approximately 60 % of men had ≥1 laboratory abnormality in both men with and without osteoporosis. Among individual tests, only vitamin D insufficiency (PR, 1.13; 95 % CI, 1.05-1.22) and high alkaline phosphatase (PR, 3.05; 95 % CI, 1.52-6.11) were more likely in men with osteoporosis. Hypercortisolism and hyperthyroidism were uncommon and not significantly more frequent in men with osteoporosis. No osteoporotic men had hypercalciuria. Conclusions: Though most of these older men had ≥1 laboratory abnormality, few routinely recommended individual tests were more common in men with osteoporosis than in those without osteoporosis. Possibly excepting vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase, benefit of routine laboratory testing to identify possible secondary causes in older osteoporotic men appears low. Results may not be generalizable to younger men or to older men in whom history and exam findings raise clinical suspicion for a secondary cause of osteoporosis.","We looked at how helpful routine lab testing is for finding underlying causes in older men diagnosed with osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle). Most men with and without osteoporosis had one or more abnormal lab measurement. Few single lab abnormalities were more common in men with osteoporosis. Routine lab testing in older men with osteoporosis may not be helpful. We aim to rate how useful recommended lab testing is to find underlying causes of osteoporosis in older men by looking at the number of older men with lab abnormalities with and without osteoporosis during a specific period. We studied 1,572 men 65 years old and older who has bone mineral density (BMD) testing and many other lab measurements. We checked for links of any lab abnormalities with osteoporosis and the number of men with osteoporosis needed to test to find one more lab abnormality compared to testing men without osteoporosis. We found that about 60% of men with and without osteoporosis had one or more lab abnormality. Among lab tests, only not enough vitamin D and high alkaline phosphatase (suggesting damage to liver or bone disorder) were more likely in men with osteoporosis. Too much cortisol (stress hormone) and overactive thyroid (metabolism-regulating hormone) were rare and not meaningfully more common in men with osteoporosis. No men with osteoporosis had high levels of calcium in the urine. Though most of these older men had one or more lab abnormality, few often-recommended tests were more common in men with osteoporosis than in those without. Except for possibly vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase, usefulness of routine lab testing to find possible underlying causes in older men with osteoporosis seems low. Results may not apply to younger men or to older men thought to have osteoporosis from underlying causes.",
38,28631809,"Background: Pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores, pressure sores or decubitus ulcers develop as a result of a localised injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both. The ulcers usually arise over a bony prominence, and are recognised as a common medical problem affecting people confined to a bed or wheelchair for long periods of time. Anabolic steroids are used as off-label drugs (drugs which are used without regulatory approval) and have been used as adjuvants to usual treatment with dressings, debridement, nutritional supplements, systemic antibiotics and antiseptics, which are considered to be supportive in healing of pressure ulcers. Anabolic steroids are considered because of their ability to stimulate protein synthesis and build muscle mass. Comprehensive evidence is required to facilitate decision making, regarding the benefits and harms of using anabolic steroids. Objectives: To assess the effects of anabolic steroids for treating pressure ulcers. Main results: The review contains only one trial with a total of 212 participants, all with spinal cord injury and open pressure ulcers classed as stage III and IV. The participants were mainly male (98.2%, 106/108) with a mean age of 58.4 (standard deviation 10.4) years in the oxandrolone group and were all male (100%, 104/104) with a mean age of 57.3 (standard deviation 11.6) years in the placebo group. This trial compared oxandrolone (20 mg/day, administered orally) with a dose of placebo (an inactive substance consisting of 98% starch and 2% magnesium stearate) and reported data on complete healing of ulcers and adverse events. There was very low-certainty evidence on the relative effect of oxandrolone on complete ulcer healing at the end of a 24-week treatment period (risk ratio RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.26) (downgraded twice for imprecision due to an extremely wide 95% CI, which spanned both benefit and harm, and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients). Thus, we are uncertain whether oxandrolone improves or reduces the complete healing of pressure ulcers, as we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. There was low-certainty evidence on the risk of non-serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo (RR 3.85, 95% CI 1.12 to 13.26) (downgraded once for imprecision and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients). Thus, the treatment with oxandrolone may increase the risk of non-serious adverse events reported in participants. There was very low-certainty evidence on the risk of serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.17) (downgraded twice for imprecision due to an extremely wide 95% CI, which spanned both benefit and harm, and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients). Of the five serious adverse events reported in the oxandrolone-treated group, none were classed by the trial teams as being related to treatment. We are uncertain whether oxandrolone increases or decreases the risk of serious adverse events as we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. Secondary outcomes such as pain, length of hospital stay, change in wound size or wound surface area, incidence of different type of infection, cost of treatment and quality of life were not reported in the included trial. Overall the evidence in this study was of very low quality (downgraded for imprecision and indirectness). This trial stopped early when the futility analysis (interim analysis) in the opinion of the study authors showed that oxandrolone had no benefit over placebo for improving ulcer healing. Authors' conclusions: There is no high quality evidence to support the use of anabolic steroids in treating pressure ulcers. Further well-designed, multicenter trials, at low risk of bias, are necessary to assess the effect of anabolic steroids on treating pressure ulcers, but careful consideration of the current trial and its early termination are required when planning future research.","Pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores, pressure sores, or decubitus ulcers develop because of a localized (regionalized) injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both. The ulcers usually occur in a bony area of the body. Ulcers are recognized as a common medical problem affecting people confined to a bed or wheelchair for long periods of time. Anabolic (muscle building) steroids are used as off-label drugs. This means they are often used without doctor approval. They have been used to increase healing alongside usual treatment with dressings, debridement (removal of damaged tissue from a wound), nutritional supplements, systemic antibiotics (full-body medicines that fight infection) and antiseptics (antimicrobial skin medication). All of these measures are considered to be supportive in pressure ulcer healing. Anabolic steroids are considered because of their ability to encourage protein synthesis and build muscle mass. Thorough evidence is required to encourage decision making in regards to the benefits and harms of using anabolic steroids. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of anabolic steroids for treating pressure ulcers. The review contains a medical trial of 212 participants, all with spinal cord injury and open pressure ulcers classed as stage III and IV. The participants were mainly male with an average age of 58.4 years in the group receiving oxandrolone (synthetic steroid) treatment. Participants were all male with an average age of 57.3 years in the placebo group. Placebos are harmless pills used as control treatments. This trial compared oxandrolone (20 mg/day, administered orally) with placebo treatment. This study reported data on complete healing of ulcers and adverse side effects. There was very low-certainty evidence on the relative effect of oxandrolone on complete ulcer healing at the end of a 24-week treatment period. Therefore, it is unclear if oxandrolone improves or reduces the complete healing of pressure ulcers. There was low-certainty evidence on the risk of non-serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo. Treatment with oxandrolone may increase the risk of non-serious negative side events reported in participants. There was very low-certainty evidence on the risk of serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo. Five serious adverse events were reported in the oxandrolone-treated group. However, none were classed by the trial teams as being related to treatment. It is unclear if oxandrolone increases or decreases the risk of serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were not reported in the included trial. Secondary outcomes include pain, length of hospital stay, change in wound size or wound surface area, incidence of different type of infection, cost of treatment, and quality of life. Overall the evidence in this study was of very low quality. This is due to lack of precision (low confidence in results) and indirectness (only males were evaluated) in data. The trial was stopped early when deeper investigation showed that oxandrolone had no benefit over the placebo for improving ulcer healing. The authors concluded there is no high quality evidence to support the use of anabolic steroids in treating pressure ulcers. Further well-designed, low-bias trials in several different facilities are needed to assess (measure) the effect of anabolic steroids on treating pressure ulcers. However, careful consideration of the current trial and its early termination are required when planning future research.",
36,34477130,"Background: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL) versus standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy in patients with renal and upper ureteric stones. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The eligible RCTs were selected from the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The reference lists of retrieved studies were also investigated. Results: Our analysis included 10 RCTs with 1612 patients. Pooled data from 10 RCTs revealed the following: stone-free rate (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.12,1.88], P = .004), operative time (mean difference [MD] = 4.10, 95% CI [-1.37,9.56], P = .14), length of hospital stay (MD = -15.31, 95% CI [-29.43,-1.19], P = .03), hemoglobin decrease (MD = -0.86, 95% CI [-1.19,-0.53], P < .00001), postoperative fever (MD = 0.83, 95% CI [0.49,1.40], P = .49), and urine leakage (MD = 0.59, 95% CI [0.25,1.37], P = .22). Besides, we performed sub-group analysis based on vacuum suction effect and multiple kidney stones. For vacuum suction effect, it revealed the following: stone-free rate in vacuum suction group (P = .007) and in non-vacuum suction group (P = .19). Operative time in vacuum suction group (P = .89), non-vacuum suction group (P = .16). Postoperative fever in vacuum suction group (P = .49), non-vacuum suction group (P = .85). Conclusion: This pooled analysis indicated that MPCNL was a safe and effective method for treating renal stones compared with standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Besides, the vacuum suction effect in MPCNL played a more important role. When it comes to multiple or staghorn stones, the longer operative time in MPCNL could not be ignored.","This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL), when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a scope to remove kidney stones versus the standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy that uses a larger instrument to remove stones. Researchers analyze data from published clinical trials. Eligible trials are from the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The articles of these clinical trials included a list of other existing studies that are also reviewed. The analysis includes 10 trials with 1612 patients. The data gathered and analyzed from the 10 trials found revealed information on the following: stone-free rate, how long the procedures take, length of hospital stay, red blood cells decrease, fever after the procedure, and urine leakage. Researchers also analyzed additional data on the effects of vacuum suction (vacuuming up stone fragments) and multiple kidney stones. For vacuum suction effect, it reveals a difference in the stone-free rate in the vacuum suction group but not in the non-vacuum suction group. There is no significant difference in how long the procedure took between the vacuum suction group and the non-vacuum suction group. There is no significant difference in having a fever after the procedure between the vacuum suction group and the non-vacuum suction group. In conclusion, this analysis suggests that minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL) is a safe and effective method for treating kidney stones compared with the standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy process. Additionally, the vacuum suction effect in MPCNL played a more important role. When it comes to multiple or staghorn (larger) stones, the longer procedure time in MPCNL could not be ignored.",
15,27151921,"We recently described a novel thiazide-sensitive electroneutral NaCl transport mechanism resulting from the parallel operation of the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger pendrin and the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) in β-intercalated cells of the collecting duct. Although a role for pendrin in maintaining Na+ balance, intravascular volume, and BP is well supported, there is no in vivo evidence for the role of NDCBE in maintaining Na+ balance. Here, we show that deletion of NDCBE in mice caused only subtle perturbations of Na+ homeostasis and provide evidence that the Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC) compensated for the inactivation of NDCBE. To unmask the role of NDCBE, we generated Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout (dKO) mice. On a normal salt diet, dKO and single-knockout mice exhibited similar activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, whereas only dKO mice displayed a lower blood K+ concentration. Furthermore, dKO mice displayed upregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the Ca2+-activated K+ channel BKCa. During NaCl depletion, only dKO mice developed marked intravascular volume contraction, despite dramatically increased renin activity. Notably, the increase in aldosterone levels expected on NaCl depletion was attenuated in dKO mice, and single-knockout and dKO mice had similar blood K+ concentrations under this condition. In conclusion, NDCBE is necessary for maintaining sodium balance and intravascular volume during salt depletion or NCC inactivation in mice. Furthermore, NDCBE has an important role in the prevention of hypokalemia. Because NCC and NDCBE are both thiazide targets, the combined inhibition of NCC and the NDCBE/pendrin system may explain thiazide-induced hypokalemia in some patients.","Past studies describe a new process to transport and reabsorb sodium and chloride ions (atoms or molecules that carry electrical charges) from one side of the cell to the other. One is called the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) that is a protein that exchanges Na+ (sodium) from outside the cell for Cl- (chloride) that is in the cell. There is no lab or test tube experiments that show evidence for the role of Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) in maintaining a sodium balance. In this present study, researchers show that reducing Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger in mice causes only minor disruptions of sodium homeostasis (processes used by the body to maintain a normal sodium concentration in the fluid outside the cells). Researchers provide evidence that the Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC) (the carrier protein that helps reabsorb sodium and chloride ions from tube fluid into the cells) compensated for the lack of action of the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger. To understand the role of Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger, researchers generated an experiment with Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice, mice without NCC or NDCBE. On a normal diet, Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout and single-knockout mice showed similar activation of the hormone system that helps regulate blood pressure, electrolytes, and some heart-related function; however, only Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice showed lower potassium in the blood. Also, Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice showed an increase in the surface sodium channels (ENaC) and the potassium channel Ca2+-activated K+ channels BKCa. When sodium-chloride is depleted, only Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice developed altered blood volume contraction, despite increased kidney activity. Notably, the increase in aldosterone (a hormone that regulates sodium and potassium levels) expected from the sodium-chloride loss was weakened in Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice. Single knock-out and Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice had similar blood potassium concentrations when this occurred. In conclusion, the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger is necessary for maintaining sodium balance and volume of blood when salt is reduced or when Na+/Cl- cotransporter Is turned off in mice. Furthermore, Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger has an important role in preventing hypokalemia (low levels of potassium). Because Na+/Cl- cotransporter and Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger are both targets of thiazide targets (which reduces sodium reabsorption), the combined slowing of Na+/Cl- cotransporter and the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger/pendrin system (a multifaceted transporter that plays important roles in various functions of the kidney) may explain thiazide generated hypokalemia in some patients.",
17,12224233,"The patient who presents with a serious head injury is often very difficult to manage. The airways is of primary concern; adequate ventilation must be provided and aspiration protected against. Recent studies suggest that hyperventilation may be as beneficial as was earlier believed. As the pCO2 level decreases, vasoconstriction occurs. If the level falls too low, cerebral perfusion is restricted, and profound cerebral anoxia may ensue. Current standards call for a ventilatory rate to allow for moderate respiratory alkalosis, in theory to mildly constrict teh vessels but still provide adequate perfusion. Arterial blood gas analysis in the ED is the definitive measurement of airway management in the field. Remember that the anatomy of the meningeal layers places the arteries primarily in the epidural space and the veins in the subdural space. A bleed in the epidural space often presents with a rapid onset of signs and symptoms, as was obvious in this traumatized patient. When a bleed occurs in the subdural space, the onset is usually more insidious, and an accurate history is a key to field diagnosis. As the hemorrhage expands, compression displaces the brain within the cranial vault. This displacement causes pressure to be exerted on the medulla of the brainstem. Cushing's Traid is a result of this pressure on the medulla and is evidence by the pulse slowing while systolic blood pressure rises and respirations become ataxic. Vomiting is often associated, and as the bleed continues, herniation syndrome begins. Decorticate posturing is displayed, followed by decerebrate posturing if relief is not provided. It is important to distinguish between decorticate and decerebrate posturing. It is important to distinguish between decorticate and decerebrate posturing. An easy way to remember the differences is to picture the anatomy of the brain. The cerebral cortex lies above the cerebellum, so when a patient's arms flexed up toward the face , he is pointing to his ""core"" (de-cor-ticate). As the arms extend downward, he is pointing to his cerebellum(de-cere-brate). T o manage the head-injured patient, it is imperative to anticipate potential developments, as well as protect against underlying injuries that may not be fully evaluated until arrival at the ED. Cervical spine often accompany head injuries, and full spinal immobilization is a mandatory precaution in all presentations. With the expanding hematoma found on this patient's neck, vascular damage ws obvious and contributed to the suspicion of spinal injury. As the intracranial pressure rise, vomiting and seizures are common. Placement of an endotracheal tube and having suction equipment ready are the best tools to prevent against aspiration. It is possible to angle the long spine board 10-15 degrees, exercising caution to ensure the patient's spinal alignment is not manipulated during the process. Seizures are usually treated with anticonvulsants like Valium. When a seizure accompanies a head injury, it is a direct result of the increased intracranial pressure and has a generally poor response to Valium, as the underlying cause of the seizure still exists. In this case, the patient had a full neuromuscular blockade, and any seizure would not have been recognized as long as the paralytics were on board. Early notification to the ED is essential, reporting all findings and interventions. This can alert them and give them the opportunity to prepare specialized equipment, such as CT scanners, mechanical ventilators, etc. Also, consider transportation options and the length of time to definitive care, including neurosurgical evaluation. This patient needs to be seen in a trauma center capable of the most thorough evaluation and management. Evacuation by air ambulance may be the most appropriate method of transport.","A person with a serious head injury is often very difficult to treat. The airways are the most important concern; enough air movement must be provided, and material entering the airway or lungs by accident must be avoided. Recent studies suggest that quick breathing or hyperventilation may be as helpful as was thought before. As the amount of carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the blood decreases, blood vessels narrow. If the amount of carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the blood gets too low, blood flow to the brain is limited, and not enough oxygen getting to the brain may follow. Current standards suggest a rate of movement of air into and out of the lungs to allow for a decrease in carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the blood, in theory to narrow the vessels but still allow enough circulation of blood through organs and tissues. Measuring oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood in the emergency department is the best measurement of airway treatment by first responders. Remember that the structure of the brain's protective layers puts the arteries in the space between the outermost layer and the skull (epidural) and the veins in the space between the outermost layer and the brain (subdural). A bleed in the epidural space often has quick signs and symptoms, as was obvious in this injured patient. A bleed in the subdural space usually happens more slowly, and knowing what happened to the person is key to a diagnosis by first responders. As the bleeding spreads, pressure pushing on the brain moves the brain within the skull. This movement of the brain puts pressure on the area of the brain that controls things like heartbeat and breathing (medulla). Pressure on the medulla causes Cushing's Triad, which is a slowing heartbeat while blood pressure increases and breathing becomes abnormal. Vomiting often occurs, and as the bleed continues, something inside the skull produces pressure that moves brain tissues. A person gets stiff with bent arms, clenched fists, and legs held out straight (decorticate posturing), followed by the arms and legs being held straight out, the toes being pointed downward, and the head and neck being arched backward (decerebrate posturing) if relief is not given. It is important to recognize the difference between decorticate and decerebrate posturing. It is important to recognize the differences between decorticate and decerebrate posturing. An easy way to remember the differences is to picture the structure of the brain. One part of the brain, the cerebral cortex, lies above another part of the brain, the cerebellum, so when a patient's arms point toward the face, he is pointing to his ""core"" (de-cor-ticate). As the arms go down to his side, he is pointing to his cerebellum (de-cere-brate). To treat the patient with a head injury, it is important to predict what might happen, and protect against other injuries that may not be realized until the patient gets to the hospital. Neck injuries often happen with head injuries, and making sure the spine cannot move is required in all cases. With the growing bruise on this patient's neck, damage to blood vessels was clear and helped lead to the belief of a spinal injury. As the pressure in the brain rises, vomiting and seizures are common. Putting in a breathing tube and having suction tools ready are the best ways to prevent material entering the airway or lungs by accident. It is possible to angle the rescue board 10-15 degrees, making sure to not change the alignment of the patient's spine. Seizures are usually treated with drugs that prevent convulsions, like Valium. When a seizure happens with a head injury, it is caused by rising pressure in the brain, and Valium does not usually help, as the cause for the seizure is not resolved. In this case, the patient had a full nerve block (paralyzed skeletal muscles). Any seizure would not have been seen while the paralyzing drugs were working. Notifying the emergency department is very important, reporting everything the first responders see and do to treat the patient. This can warn emergency staff and give them the chance to get specialized equipment ready (e.g., CT scanners, mechanical ventilators). Also, think about how to get the patient to the hospital and how much time it will take to best care for the patient, including seeing a brain surgeon. This patient needs to be seen in a trauma center able to do the most complete evaluation and treatment. A medical helicopter may be the best way to get the patient to the hospital.",
48,34603289,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a common autoimmune connective tissue disease with unclear etiology and pathogenesis. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and MSC derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) play important roles in regulating innate and adaptive immunity, which are involved in many physiological and pathological processes and contribute to the immune homeostasis in SLE. The effects of MSCs and EVs on SLE have been drawing more and more attention during the past few years. This article reviews the immunomodulatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MSC/MSC-EVs in SLE, which provides novel insight into understanding SLE pathogenesis and guiding the biological therapy.","Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is a common autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues. It is unclear how the disease develops. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) are cells that are present in adult bone marrow and the umbilical cord, and extracellular vesicles released from MSC cells are particles that carry molecules, proteins and other substances between cells. These play important roles in regulating natural immunity and immunity acquired after exposure to a virus or to bacteria, which are involved in many disease development processes. The effects of MSC cells and extracellular vesicles on lupus have been drawing more and more attention during the past few years. This article reviews the changes in the body's immune system and underlying process of MSC and extracellular vesicles in lupus, which provides new insight into understanding the disease development of lupus and guiding therapy.",
21,33064426,"Groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and comprise inguinal and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias are more common in men. Although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. Ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g., groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. Herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients. Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.","Digestive organs (e.g., intestines) coming out through a weak point or tear in the abdomen causes groin hernias and includes inguinal (groin area) and femoral (upper thigh area) hernias. Inguinal hernias happen more in men. Although groin hernias are easily seen in a physical exam in men, ultrasound is often needed in women. Ultrasound is also helpful when a doctor thinks a hernia has returned, there is a complication after surgery to repair the hernia, or there is another cause of pain (e.g., groin mass, fluid collection in the scrotum). MRI has higher accuracy for detection and no detection than ultrasound and is useful for diagnosing hidden hernias if a doctor thinks it is hernia even if an ultrasound does not show one. Injecting a substance into the hernia sac to improve visibility in x-rays may be used in some patients. Learning about the common types of surgeries can help family doctors improve care after surgery and look for complications, including the hernia returning. Minimally invasive repair has a shorter recovery time, earlier return to daily activities, less pain, and lower return rates than traditional repair. Men with inguinal hernias and with few to no symptoms can reasonably and safely watch the hernia without treatment unless symptoms appear or change. Watching without treatment unless symptoms appear or change is not suggested in people with hernias with symptoms or in nonpregnant women.",
