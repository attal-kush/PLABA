11,31627352,"Diets low in carbohydrates and proteins and enriched in fat stimulate the hepatic synthesis of ketone bodies (KB). These molecules are used as alternative fuel for energy production in target tissues. The synthesis and utilization of KB are tightly regulated both at transcriptional and hormonal levels. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), currently recognized as one of the master regulators of ketogenesis, integrates nutritional signals to the activation of transcriptional networks regulating fatty acid β-oxidation and ketogenesis. New factors, such as circadian rhythms and paracrine signals, are emerging as important aspects of this metabolic regulation. However, KB are currently considered not only as energy substrates but also as signaling molecules. β-hydroxybutyrate has been identified as class I histone deacetylase inhibitor, thus establishing a connection between products of hepatic lipid metabolism and epigenetics. Ketogenic diets (KD) are currently used to treat different forms of infantile epilepsy, also caused by genetic defects such as Glut1 and Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Deficiency Syndromes. However, several researchers are now focusing on the possibility to use KD in other diseases, such as cancer, neurological and metabolic disorders. Nonetheless, clear-cut evidence of the efficacy of KD in other disorders remains to be provided in order to suggest the adoption of such diets to metabolic-related pathologies.","Diets low in carbs and proteins and high in fat quicken the creation of liver ketone bodies (KB) (particles made from fat breakdown). KB are used for energy creation in certain body parts. The creation and use of KB from fat breakdown are monitored both at the cellular and multi-cellular level. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) is a major regulator of the creation of KB made from fat breakdown. It combines diet signals to the start up of cellular systems monitoring fat breakdown and KB creation. New factors, like sleep-wake patterns and cellular signals, may strongly influence this metabolic monitoring. However, KB are not just energy particles but also signaling particles. β-hydroxybutyrate (a particle made from fat breakdown) blocks some cellular processes. This creates a connection between products of liver fat breakdown and changes in gene expression without changes to the DNA sequence. Ketogenic diets (KD) or low-carb diets are used to treat different forms of infatile epilepsy, a disorder in babies that disturbs brain and nerve activity and causes seizures. Infantile epilepsy is also caused by flaws in gene expression. However, researchers are now focusing on using KD in other diseases, such as cancer, nerve-related and metabolic disorders. More evidence is needed to use KD diets to treat diseases.","Diets low in carbohydrates and proteins but high in fat stimulate the liver to make fat-related energy molecules called ketone bodies (KB). Ketone bodies are molecules used as alternate fuel to produce energy for tissues in the body. Making and using ketone bodies is carefully controlled within the body at the molecule and hormone level. One hormone, known as the master regulator of the process to develop ketone bodies, helps activate the cell networks that control fatty acids and ketogenesis, the process that creates ketone bodies. New factors, such as circadian rhythms (the natural cycle of mental and physical changes in the body over 24 hours) and paracrine signals (cell signaling to communicate with other cells nearby), are becoming important aspects of this metabolic regulation that controls and monitors cell energy stores. However, ketone bodies are currently considered not only as an energy supply but also as signaling molecules that send messages to other cells or parts of the body. Ketogenic diets are currently used to treat different forms of infantile epilepsy (the onset of seizures in infancy), which is also caused by genetic defects. However, several researchers are now focusing on the possibility to use ketogenic diets in other diseases, such as cancer, brain-related and metabolic disorders.

7,7864482,"Most patients who seek medical attention for sore throat are concerned about streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, but fewer than 10% of adults and 30% of children actually have a streptococcal infection. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) are most often responsible for bacterial tonsillopharyngitis, although Neisseria gonorrhea, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum (formerly Corynebacterium haemolyticum), Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR agent), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have also been suggested as possible, infrequent, sporadic pathogens. Viruses or idiopathic causes account for the remainder of sore throat complaints. Reliance on clinical impression to diagnose GAS tonsillopharyngitis is problematic; an overestimation of 80% to 95% by experienced clinicians typically occurs for adult patients. Overtreatment promotes bacterial resistance, disturbs natural microbial ecology, and may produce unnecessary side effects. Existing data suggest that rapid GAS antigen testing as an aid to clinical diagnosis can be very useful. When used appropriately, it is sensitive (79% to 88%) in detecting GAS-infected patients and is specific (90% to 96%) and cost-effective. Penicillin has been the treatment of choice for GAS tonsillopharyngitis since the 1950s; 10 days of treatment are necessary for bacterial eradication. A single IM injection of benzathine penicillin is effective and obviates compliance issues. Until the early 1970s, the bacteriologic failure rate for the treatment of GAS tonsillopharyngitis ranged from 2% to 10% and was attributed to chronic GAS carriers. Since the late 1970s, the penicillin failure rate has frequently exceeded 20% in published reports. Explanations for recurrent GAS tonsillopharyngitis include poor patient compliance; reacquisition from a family member or peer, copathogenic colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, anaerobes that inactivate penicillin with beta-lactamase, or all these organisms; suppression of natural immune response by too-early administration of antibiotics; GAS tolerance to penicillin; antibiotic eradication of normal pharyngeal flora that normally act as natural host defenses; and establishment of a true carrier state. When therapy fails, milder symptoms may occur during the relapse. Several antimicrobials have demonstrated superior efficacy compared with penicillin in eradicating GAS and are administered less frequently to enhance patient compliance. In previously untreated GAS throat infections, cephalosporins produce a 5% to 22% higher bacteriologic cure rate; after a penicillin treatment failure, these differences are greater. Amoxicillin/clavulanate and the extended-spectrum macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin may also produce enhanced bacteriologic eradication in comparison to penicillin.","Most people who go to a doctor for sore throat are worried they have a strep throat and tonsil infection, but fewer than 10% of adults and 30% of children actually have a strep infection. Group A strep bacteria are the most common cause of bacterial strep throat and tonsil infection, but other bacteria known to cause sexually-transmitted gonorrhea or chlamydia, or head, neck, and lung infections occasionally might cause it. Remaining sore throat issues are caused by viruses and unknown causes. Relying on a doctor's exam to diagnose group A strep throat and tonsil infection causes problems. Experienced doctors over-diagnose 80 to 95% of adult cases. Doctors treating someone more than needed leads to the ability of bacteria to defeat the antibiotics designed to kill them, affects small organisms that live in or on the human body, and may cause side effects that are not needed. Studies show combining a rapid strep testing (using a throat swab to detect bacterial fragments) with a doctor exam can be helpful for diagnosis. When used correctly, a rapid strep test has high accuracy for group A strep throat and tonsil infection detection and does not cost a lot. Penicillin has been the preferred treatment for group A strep throat and tonsil infection since the 1950s. Taking penicillin for 10 days is needed to kill all the group A bacteria. One benzathine penicillin shot works and does not require people following doctor instructions. Until the early 1970s, the rate of group A strep bacteria coming back after treatment was low and thought to be caused by people who had long-term Group A bacteria in their bodies. Since the late 1970s, the rate of group A strep bacteria coming back after treatment more than doubled according to studies. Reasons for reoccurring group A strep throat and tonsil infection are people not following doctor instructions; getting the infection again from a family member or peer; infection caused by group A strep bacteria and other bacteria; taking antibiotics too early in the infection; group A strep bacteria defeating antibiotics used to kill them; antibiotics killing small organisms in the throat that protect it; and people who have the bacteria in their bodies but are not sick. When treatment doesn't work, milder symptoms may happen as symptoms return. Many substances that kill small organisms have worked better than penicillin to kill group A strep bacteria and are given less often to increase the rate at which people follow doctor orders. In group A strep and tonsil infection that is not treated, cephalosporins, another type of antibiotic, kill all group A strep bacteria more often than penicillin. After penicillin is taken and does not cure group A strep throat and tonsil infection, this rate is higher. A combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate, other antibiotics, and clarithromycin and azithromycin, another kind of antibiotics called macrolides that kill more types of bacteria, may also kill more bacteria than penicillin.",,"fewer than 10% of adults and 30% of children actually have a streptococcal infection. overtreatment promotes bacterial resistance, disturbs natural microbial ecology, and may produce unnecessary side effects.

Currently, no cure for OA is known, and non-pharmacological modalities are recommended as first-line care. A positive effect of exercise in hip and knee OA has been documented, but the effect of exercise on hand OA remains uncertain. Authors' conclusions: When we pooled results from five studies, we found low-quality evidence showing small beneficial effects of exercise on hand pain, function and finger joint stiffness. Estimated effect sizes were small, and whether they represent a clinically important change may be debated. One study reported quality of life, and the effect is uncertain.

43,27324363,"There have been significant advances in pacing and implantable defibrillator technology over the past decade. The relationships between ventricular activation sequence and cardiac mechanical performance are now better appreciated, and will become more completely understood. Even in the setting of infra-His block and bundle branch block, ventricular activation over the Purkinje system can now be achieved in many patients with direct pacing of the His bundle, providing a more physiologic alternative to RV pacing that should avoid pacing induced ventricular dysfunction, as well as provide an alternative to left ventricular pacing for CRT. Advances in the lead technology will increase ease and use of this form of pacing. When activation of the ventricles from the His Purkinje system is not feasible, LV pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) will continue to be important for patients with depressed ventricular function associated with left bundle branch block. Surprisingly, CRT is often beneficial even though present implementation is limited to the few LV pacing sites accessible through the coronary venous system. The advent of pacing leads with multiple electrodes for placement in the coronary venous system is a notable advance, that in contrast to traditional bipolar leads, provides multiple LV pacing configurations from which to select the optimal site for LV pacing without compromising lead stability. This option also addresses problems of phrenic nerve stimulation and high pacing thresholds that often limit delivery of LV pacing. These leads will also allow performance of simultaneous pacing from multiple LV sites, which may improve mechanical performance in situations other than left bundle branch block.","Over the past decade, there have been major advances in the development of pacemakers and the implantable defibrillator, a device that monitors your heart rate and delivers a strong electrical shock to restore the heartbeat to normal. The relationship between when the lower chambers of the heart are activated and how the heart pumps are now better understood. Activating the lower chambers of the heart (ventricular activation) can now be achieved in many patients with pacing of the His bundle (a part of the electrical conduction system of the heart that transmits pulses). This approach provides an alternative to right ventricle pacing that may cause ventricles in the heart to not function properly. Advances in the technology will increase ease and use of this form of pacing. When it is not possible to activate the ventricles from the His Purkinje system that is the rapid electric conduction in the ventricles, left ventricle pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy or CRT (treatment that helps the heart beat at the right rhythm) will continue to be important for patients with slower ventricular function. Surprisingly, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is often beneficial even though current use is limited to the few places in the left ventricle. The development of pacing devices with multiple placements in the heart system is an important advance and provided multiple left ventricle pacing arrangements to select from to find the best site. This option also addresses problems of electric stimulation of the diaphragm and high pacing ceilings that often limit delivery of left ventricle pacing. These leads will also allow performance of simultaneous pacing from multiple left ventricle sites, which may improve mechanical performance in situations other than when there is a delay or blockage of electrical impulses to the left side of the heart.",,"LV pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) will continue to be important for patients with depressed ventricular function associated with left bundle branch block. advancements in the lead technology will increase ease and use of this form of puling and implantable defibrillator technology over the past decade. if activation of the ventricles from the His Purkinje system is not feasible, CRT is often beneficial even though present implementation is limited to the few sites accessible through the coronary venous"
46,33331662,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life-shortening genetic condition caused by a variant in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. A class II CFTR variant F508del (found in up to 90% of people with CF (pwCF)) is the commonest CF-causing variant. The faulty protein is degraded before reaching the cell membrane, where it needs to be to effect transepithelial salt transport. The F508del variant lacks meaningful CFTR function and corrective therapy could benefit many pwCF. Therapies in this review include single correctors and any combination of correctors and potentiators.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life-shortening inherited condition caused by a change in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The most common change, F508del, is a protein processing change, and up to 90% of people with CF have this change. The faulty protein is destroyed before reaching the cell membrane, where it needs to be to move salt across epithelial cells (cells that cover outer surface of the internal organs). The F508del change doesn't work properly and treatment to fix this could help many people with CF. We review single correctors, which help the CFTR protein form the right shape to move to the cell surface, and any combination of correctors and potentiators, which are CFTR modulators (influencers) that hold the gate to the CFTR channel open so chloride can flow through the cell membrane.",,"class II CFTR variant F508del (found in up to 90% of people with pwCF) is the commonest variant. the faulty protein is degraded before reaching the cell membrane, where it needs to be to effect transepithelial salt transport, causing the disease to occur in the cells."
49,27586538,"Background: Leg edema is a common adverse effect of dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB) that may need dose reduction or drug withdrawal, adversely affecting the antihypertensive efficacy. Leg edema is reported to occur less often with (S)-amlodipine compared to conventional racemic amlodipine. We aimed to find the incidence of leg edema as a primary outcome and antihypertensive efficacy with (S)-amlodipine compared to conventional amlodipine. Methods: This prospective, double-blind, controlled clinical trial randomized 172 hypertensive patients, not controlled on beta-blockers (BB) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), to either conventional amlodipine (5-10 mg; n = 86) or (S)-amlodipine (2.5-5 mg; n = 86), while continuing their previous anti-hypertensive medications. Sample was sufficient to find a difference in edema between the interventions with 80 % power at 5 % significance level. Intension to treat analysis (ITT) for safety data and per protocol analysis for efficacy data was performed. Fischer's exact test was applied to observe difference between responder rates and proportions of subjects having peripheral edema in the two groups. Pitting edema test scores were compared using Mann-Whitney test. Results: Altogether 146 patients (amlodipine, n = 76 and (S)-amlodipine, n = 70) completed 120 days treatment. Demographic variables and treatment adherence were comparable in the two groups. Incidence of new edema after randomization was 31.40 % in test group and 46.51 % in control group [p = 0.03; absolute risk reduction (ARR) = 15.1 %; Number Needed to Treat (NNT) = 7, ITT analysis]. Pitting edema score and patient rated edema score increased significantly in the control compared to test group (p = 0.038 and 0.036 respectively) after treatment period. Edema scores increased significantly in the control group from baseline (p < 0.0001). Responders in blood pressure were 98.57 % in test and 98.68 % in control group. Most common adverse events (AE) were pitting edema and increased urinary frequency. Incidence of all AEs other than edema was similar in both groups. Two serious AEs occurred unrelated to therapy. Biochemical and ECG parameters in the two groups were comparable. Conclusions: In hypertensive patients not controlled on prior BB and ACEI/ARB therapy, addition of (S)-amlodipine besylate at half the dose of conventional amlodipine provides better tolerability with reduced incidence of peripheral edema, and equal antihypertensive efficacy compared to amlodipine given at usual doses.","Leg edema is a common side effect of dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB), medicines taken to control blood pressure and other conditions. The dose amount of CBB drugs may need to be reduced or stopped, negatively impacting the drugs' use to control blood pressure. Leg edema (fluid swelling) is reported to occur less often with a type of CBB medicine called (S)-amlodipine compared to the regular racemic amlodipine medicine. Researchers aim to find the number of times leg edema appeared and how well blood pressure is lowered with (S)-amlodipine compared to conventional amlodipine. This clinical trial followed 172 patients with high blood pressure, not controlled by using beta-blockers (BB) drugs or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) that keep blood vessels open. These patients are randomly placed in groups to receive either standard amlodipine (86 patients) or (S)-amlodipine (86 patients), while continuing their previous anti-hypertensive medications. The number of patients in this study is sufficient to find a difference in edema between the two groups. Data from both treatment groups are analyzed during the study. Data are analyzed to observe the difference between the two groups on how they responded to the treatment and the number of people who develop peripheral edema (swelling in lower legs and hands). Pitting edema, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation, is measured and scored. Altogether 146 patients completed 120 days treatment: 76 patients in the standard amlodipine group and 70 in the (S)-amlodipine group. Characteristics such as age and sex and how well patients took the medicine as directed are compared between the two groups. New edema is 31.40 % in the (S)-amlodipine group and 46.51 % in the standard group. Pitting edema score and patient rated edema score increase significantly in the amlodipine compared to (S)-amlodipine group after the treatment period. Edema scores increase significantly in the amlodipine group from the start of the study. Responders in blood pressure are 98.57 % in (S)-amlodipine and 98.68 % in amlodipine group.

16,1139040,"Lymphocyte kinetic studies employing 51-chromium-labeled autologous lymphocytes were performed in nine normal volunteers in order to determine the effects of hydrocortisone administration on the recirculating versus the nonrecirculating intravascular lymphocyte pools. Following infusion of labeled cells, the recirculating portion of the labeled cells rapidly equilibrated with the total intravascular lymphocyte pool and the vastly larger total-body recirculating lymphocyte pool, so that by 1 hr following infusion 21.8% plus or minus 3.2% of the labeled lymphocytes were left in the circulation. Four hundred milligrams of intravenous hydrocortisone administered 24 hr after infusion of labeled cells caused a profound but transient lymphocytopenia which was maximal at 4 hr with return of lymphocyte counts to normal by 24 hr after injection. Concomitant with the lymphocytopenia there was a dramatic increase in lymphocyte specific activity (cpm per 10-6 lymphocytes), while the total lymphocyte-associated radioactivity remaining in the circulation was unchanged, indicating that corticosteroid administration depleted the unlabeled recirculating cells. As the lymphocyte counts returned to normal following hydrocortisone, the specific activity also returned to normal. These studies indicated that hydrocortisone administration caused a transient lymphocytopenia by a preferential depletion of the recirculating portion of the intravascular lymphocyte pool.","Studies on lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system) that are taken from people and returned to the same individuals is performed on nine healthy volunteers to determine the effects of hydrocortisone (a steroid medication used to help calm the immune system) on the lymphocyte pools in blood.

51,10909610,"Islet cell antibodies (ICA) continue to serve as the basis of the principal serological test for definition of active autoimmunity of beta-cells. Its disadvantages are the need for human pancreatic tissue and difficulty in obtaining quantitative results. In the past decade biochemically-defined beta-cell toxins were described, leading to the development of sensitive and specific autoantibody assays, to predict insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). We examined the value of combined biochemically-based serological assays, such as autoantibodies to insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and ICA512 (ICA512A) to replace the traditional ICA assay. Blood samples of 114 newly diagnosed IDDM patients, aged 12 +/- 5 yrs (range 2 months-29 years) were tested for ICA (indirect immunofluorescence), IAA, GADA and ICA512A (radiobinding assay). The latter 2 assays were performed using recombinant human [35S]-labeled antigen produced by in vitro transcription/translation. We found that fewer sera scored positive for ICA and/or IAA (80.7%, 92/114) than for 1 or more of IAA, GAD, or ICA512 (88.6%, 101/114).

32,29371246,"Objective: This post hoc analysis of the CSPPT (China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial) assessed the individual variation in total homocysteine (tHcy)-lowering response after an average 4.5 years of 0.8 mg daily folic acid therapy in Chinese hypertensive adults and evaluated effect modification by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotypes and serum folate levels. Approach and results: This analysis included 16 413 participants from the CSPPT, who were randomly assigned to 2 double-blind treatment groups: either 10-mg enalapril+0.8-mg folic acid or 10-mg enalapril, daily and had individual measurements of serum folate and tHcy levels at baseline and exit visits and MTHFR C677T genotypes. Mean baseline tHcy levels were comparable between the 2 treatment groups (14.5±8.5 versus 14.4±8.1 μmol/L; P=0.561).

More importantly, tHcy lowering varied by MTHFR genotypes and serum folate levels. Compared with CC and CT genotypes, participants with the TT genotype had a more prominent L-shaped curve between tHcy and serum folate levels and required higher folate levels (at least 15 ng/mL) to eliminate the differences in tHcy by genotypes. Conclusions: Compared with CC or CT, tHcy in the TT group manifested a heightened L-shaped curve from low to high folate levels, but this difference in tHcy by genotype was eliminated when plasma folate levels reach ≈15 ng/mL or higher.

40,23641263,"Aim: A review is given on the different tools of compression therapy and their mode of action. Methods: Interface pressure and stiffness of compression devices, alone or in combination can be measured in vivo. Hemodynamic effects have been demonstrated by measuring venous volume and flow velocity using MRI, Duplex and radioisotopes, venous reflux and venous pumping function using plethysmography and phlebodynamometry. Oedema reduction can be measured by limb volumetry. Results: Compression stockings exerting a pressure of ~20 mm Hg on the distal leg are able to increase venous blood flow velocity in the supine position and to prevent leg swelling after prolonged sitting and standing. In the upright position, an interface pressure of more than 50 mmHg is needed for intermittent occlusion of incompetent veins and for a reduction of ambulatory venous hypertension during walking. Such high intermittent interface pressure peaks exerting a ""massaging effect"" may rather be achieved by short stretch multilayer bandages than by elastic stockings.

53,25555390,"Background: Although physical exercise (PE) is recommended for individuals with type 1 diabetes (DM1), participation in exercise is challenging because it increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia and the available therapeutic options to prevent it frequently result in hyperglycemia. There is no clear recommendation about the best timing for exercise. The aim of this study was to compare the risk of hypoglycemia after morning or afternoon exercise sessions up to 36 hours postworkout. Methods: This randomized crossover study enrolled subjects with DM1, older than 18 years of age, on sensor-augmented insulin pump (SAP) therapy. Participants underwent 2 moderate-intensity exercise sessions; 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon, separated by a 7 to 14 day wash-out period. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data were collected 24 hours before, during and 36 hours after each session. Results: Thirty-five subjects (mean age 30.31 ± 12.66 years) participated in the study. The rate of hypoglycemia was significantly lower following morning versus afternoon exercise sessions (5.6 vs 10.7 events per patient, incidence rate ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43-0.63; P < .0001).

Building on murine studies, a series of papers appeared recently showing that therapeutic irradiation of the ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) retards growth of more peripherally growing cortical glioblastomas in humans, suggesting a tumor trophic function for the SVZ. Further studies showed that SVZ cells migrate out towards a peripheral glioblastoma. Dopamine signaling through D3 subtype receptor indirectly drives this centrifugal migration in humans. Since psychiatry has several drugs with good D3 blocking attributes, such as fluphenazine, or perphenazine, we suggest that adding one of these D3 blocking drugs to current standard treatment of resection followed by temozolomide and irradiation might prolong survival by depriving glioblastoma of the trophic functions previously subserved by dopaminergic signaling on SVZ cells.","We look at a possible new treatment to add to standard treatment for glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer.

45,29295637,"Aims: To describe the utilization of clostridial collagenase ointment (CCO) and medicinal honey debridement methods in real-world inpatient and outpatient hospital settings among pressure ulcer (PU) patients and compare the frequency of healthcare re-encounters between CCO- and medicinal honey-treated patients. Materials and methods: De-identified hospital discharge records for patients receiving CCO or medicinal honey methods of debridement and having an ICD-9 code for PU were extracted from the US Premier Healthcare Database. Multivariable analysis was used to compare the frequency of inpatient and outpatient revisits up to 6 months after an index encounter for CCO- vs medicinal honey-treated PUs. Results: The study identified 48,267 inpatients and 2,599 outpatients with PUs treated with CCO or medicinal honeys. Among study inpatients, n = 44,725 (93%) were treated with CCO, and n = 3,542 (7%) with medicinal honeys. CCO and medicinal honeys accounted for 1,826 (70%) and 773 (30%), respectively, of study outpatients. In adjusted models, those treated with CCO had lower odds for inpatient readmissions (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.80-0.94) after inpatient index visits, and outpatient re-encounters both after inpatient (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.67-0.79) and outpatient (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.64-0.95) index visits in 6 months of follow-up. Limitations: The study was observational in nature, and did not adjust for reasons why patients were hospitalized initially, or why they returned to the facility. Although the study adjusted for differences in a variety of demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics between the treatments, we are not able to rule out selection bias. Conclusion: Patients with CCO-treated PUs returned to inpatient and outpatient hospital settings less often compared with medicinal honey-treated PUs. These results from real-world administrative data help to gain a better understanding of the clinical characteristics of patients with PUs treated with these two debridement methods and the economic implications of debridement choice in the acute care setting.","We aim to describe the use of clostridial collagenase ointment (CCO - a medication with special proteins) and medical honey to remove damaged tissue in hospitals among bedsore patients and compare how often CCO- and medical honey-treated patients return to the hospital.

We used statistical models to compare how often patients who did and did not stay at least one night in the hospital returned to the hospital up to 6 months after bedsore treatment with either CCO or medical honey. We looked at 48,267 and 2,599 patients with bedsores treated with CCO or medicine honeys who did and did not stay at least one night at the hospital, respectively. CCO and medical honeys made up 44,725 (93%) and 3,542 (7%), respectively, of people who stayed at least one night in the hospital. CCO and medical honeys made up 1,826 (70%) and 773 (30%), respectively, of people who did not stay a night in the hospital. Based on models, patients treated with CCO were less likely to be readmitted to the hospital after being admitted, and to return to the hospital but not stay a night after either going to the hospital and staying or not staying at least one night over the following 6 months. Study limitations included not considering why patients were hospitalized or why they returned to the hospital. Even though we took into account differences in many population, clinical, and hospital characteristics between the treatments, the study population may have not been completely random.

Since the widespread implementation of vaccination campaigns, reports of ocular adverse effects after COVID-19 vaccinations have emerged.

Results: Ocular adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations include facial nerve palsy, abducens nerve palsy, acute macular neuroretinopathy, central serous retinopathy, thrombosis, uveitis, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease reactivation, and new-onset Graves' Disease. Studies in current literature are primarily retrospective case series or isolated case reports - these are inherently weak in establishing association or causality. Nevertheless, the described presentations resemble the reported ocular manifestations of the COVID-19 disease itself. Hence, we hypothesize that the human body's immune response to COVID-19 vaccinations may be involved in the pathogenesis of the ocular adverse effects post-COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusion: Ophthalmologists and generalists should be aware of the possible, albeit rare, ocular adverse effects after COVID-19 vaccination.","The pandemic of Covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) has led to the development of new vaccines at an very fast pace. Since the start of major efforts to promote vaccination, reports of ocular adverse effects, which are side effects that impact the eyes or the face near the eyes, after Covid-19 vaccinations have emerged. This review summarizes these ocular adverse effects that are possibly associated with Covid-19 vaccines and discusses their medical traits and how to care for these effects. Ocular adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccinations include weakness or paralysis in the facial muscles, problems with eye movement, blind or blurry spots, distorted vision due to fluid build up in the eye, blood clots in the veins or arteries, inflammation (redness or swelling from fighting an infection) inside the eye, inflammation in the retina of the eye, rapid vision loss from previous diseases, and newly-contracted Graves' Disease, a condition that increases thyroid (metabolism-regulating) hormones and can impact the skin and eyes. Published studies mainly use existing information from previous cases or isolated reports; these are weak studies in establishing association or cause and effect. However, the described cases are similar, regarding the impact on the eyes or vision, to the Covid-19 disease itself. Researchers have a theory that the body's immune response to Covid-19 vaccinations may be involved in the development of the ocular adverse effects that occur after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine.

Levodopa decreased prefrontal cortex activity compared with off medication (effect size, -0.51), whereas the addition of donepezil reversed this decrease. Gait speed and stride length under single- and dual-task conditions improved with combined donepezil and levodopa compared with off medication (effect size, 1 for gait speed and 0.75 for stride length). Dual-task reaction time was quicker with levodopa compared with off medication (effect size, -0.87), and accuracy improved with combined donepezil and levodopa (effect size, 0.47). Cholinergic therapy, specifically donepezil 5 mg/day for 2 weeks, can alter prefrontal cortex activity when walking and improve secondary cognitive task accuracy and gait in PD. Further studies will investigate whether higher prefrontal cortex activity while walking is associated with gait changes.","Dopamine is a chemical messenger that carries signals between brain cells and affects mood, motivation, and movement. The breakdown and inactivation of dopamine in Parkinson's disease (PD) may initially be addressed by increased cognitive (thought-related) control brought about by cholinergic mechanisms (types of drugs that inhibit, enhance, or imitate the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, the primary signaling molecule of nerve cells). Shift to cognitive control of walking can be measured by prefrontal cortex activation (activating the part of the brain that controls behavior, such as decision-making). Levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) improves certain aspects of gait (how a person walks) and worsens others. Cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity remains unclear. This study examines dopaminergic (drugs that increase dopamine activity) and cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity while walking in PD. A clinical study examines the effects of levodopa and donepezil (a type of drug that helps mental function) in Parkinson's disease. In this study, 20 people with Parkinson's disease were randomly put in treatment groups, and 19 completed the study. Participants were randomly put in either the group that received both levodopa + donepezil or the group that received levodopa + placebo (sham) treatments, with 2 weeks spent on treatment and a 2-week washout (the study phase when the drug is stopped and no other drug is used). The main outcome (result) is change in prefrontal cortex activity while walking. Secondary outcomes are change in gait, dual-task performance (doing two tasks at the same time), and attention.

10,21493175,"Objective: To identify through case study the presentation and possible pathophysiological cause of complex regional pain syndrome and its preferential response to stellate ganglion blockade. Setting: Complex regional pain syndrome can occur in an extremity after minor injury, fracture, surgery, peripheral nerve insult or spontaneously and is characterised by spontaneous pain, changes in skin temperature and colour, oedema, and motor disturbances. Pathophysiology is likely to involve peripheral and central components and neurological and inflammatory elements. There is no consistent approach to treatment with a wide variety of specialists involved. Diagnosis can be difficult, with over-diagnosis resulting from undue emphasis placed upon pain disproportionate to an inciting event despite the absence of other symptoms or under-diagnosed when subtle symptoms are not recognised. The International Association for the Study of Pain supports the use of sympathetic blocks to reduce sympathetic nervous system overactivity and relieve complex regional pain symptoms. Educational reviews promote stellate ganglion blockade as beneficial. Three blocks were given at 8, 10 and 13 months after the initial injury under local anaesthesia and sterile conditions. Physiotherapeutic input was delivered under block conditions to maximise joint and tissue mobility and facilitate restoration of function. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the need for practitioners from all disciplines to be able to identify the clinical characteristics of complex regional pain syndrome to instigate immediate treatment and supports the notion that stellate ganglion blockade is preferable to upper limb intravenous regional anaesthetic block for refractory index finger pain associated with complex regional pain syndrome.","The objective of this case report (a summary of an individual patient's symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment) is to identify the sign or symptoms and causes of complex regional pain syndrome (a form of ongoing pain that affects the arm or leg) and if a pain treatment called stellate ganglion blockade (an injection of medication into nerves at the front of the neck that can relieve pain) has any effect on the pain. Complex regional pain syndrome can occur in the arms or legs after a minor injury, fracture, surgery, or nerve damage. It appears as sudden, random pain, changes in skin temperatures and color, swelling in ankles, feet or legs, and uncontrollable movements in the body. Disease-related physical changes are likely to involve outer and central parts, nerve-related elements, and inflammatory elements, the body's natural response to injury or infection. There is no consistent approach to treatment with a wide variety of specialists involved. Diagnosis can be difficult. Sometimes it is over-diagnosed (diagnosis of a medical condition that would never have caused any symptoms or problems) from too much attention on the pain even though other symptoms are not present. Sometimes it can be under-diagnosed (diagnosed less often than its occurrence) when less obvious symptioms are not recognized. A professional medical association for the study of pain supports the kind of pain block used in stellate ganglion blockade to reduce sensory nerves and relieve pain sympoms. Educational reviews promote stellate ganglion blockade as beneficial. Three blocks (injections) were given at 8, 10 and 13 months after the initial injury under local anaesthesia and clean conditions. Physical therapy was provided after the patient received an injection to allow more movement of the joint and tissues and to help restore use of the injured finger. This case shows that healthcare providers need to be able to identify clinical signs of complex regional pain syndrome to start treatment immediately. It also shows that stellate ganglion blockade is a preferable method to an IV of local anaesthetic (one-time injection of medicine that numbs a small area of the body) in the upper arm to help finger pain associated with complex regional pain syndrome.",,"complex regional pain syndrome can occur in an extremity after minor injury, fracture, surgery, peripheral nerve insult or spontaneously and is characterised by spontaneous pain, changes in skin temperature and colour, oedema, and motor disturbances. there is no consistent approach to treatment with a wide variety of specialists involved.

Here, we assessed the immunomodulatory effects of viable and non-viable Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains in human respiratory epithelial cells (Calu-3 cells) and the capacity of these immunobiotic lactobacilli to reduce their susceptibility to the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Immunobiotic L. plantarum MPL16 and CRL1506 differentially modulated IFN-β, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL5 and CXCL10 production and IFNAR2, DDX58, Mx1 and OAS1 expression in Calu-3 cells stimulated with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). Furthermore, the MPL16 and CRL1506 strains increased the resistance of Calu-3 cells to the challenge with SARS-CoV-2. L. plantarum MPL16 induced these beneficial effects more efficiently than the CRL1506 strain. Of note, neither non-viable MPL16 and CRL1506 strains nor the non-immunomodulatory strains L. plantarum CRL1905 and MPL18 could modify the resistance of Calu-3 cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection or the immune response to poly(I:C) challenge. To date, the potential beneficial effects of immunomodulatory probiotics on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcome have been extrapolated from studies carried out in the context of other viral pathogens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the ability of immunomodulatory lactobacilli to positively influence the replication of the new coronavirus. Further mechanistic studies and in vivo experiments in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection are necessary to identify specific strains of beneficial immunobiotic lactobacilli like L. plantarum MPL16 or CRL1506 for the prevention or treatment of the COVID-19.","Lactobacilli is a type of probiotic (good bacteria) found in the digestive system and can be consumed to improve gut health.

Lactobacilli bacteria that comes from plants is tested to see how it impacts the immune systems of the cells in the lungs and if it can reduce the ability of the coronavirus (a virus causing COVID-19 - a lung infection) from entering the cells. Two types of lactobacilli bacteria that come from plants, called MPL16 and CRL506, are tested to understand their influence on the production of cells that are part of the immune response and the development of proteins. Additionally, these two types of bacteria increase the resistance of certain cells in the lungs called Calu-3 against the coronavirus. The lactobacilli MPL16 bacteria started these beneficial effects more efficiently than the CRL1506. No lactobacilli bacteria from the tested plants can change the resistance of Calu-3 cells to coronavirus infection.

The literature indicates that all types of barrier product are clinically effective, with little comparative evidence indicating that any one ingredient is more efficacious than another, although film-forming polymers and cyanoacrylates have been found to be easier to apply and more cost-effective. However, laboratory evidence, albeit limited, indicates that a concentrated cyanoacrylate produced a more substantial and adherent layer on a porcine explant when compared with a diluted cyanoacrylate and was more effective at protecting skin from abrasion and repeated exposure to moisture than a film-forming polymer.

TNSALP is a cell-surface homodimeric phosphomonoester phosphohydrolase expressed in healthy people especially in the skeleton, liver, kidneys, and developing teeth. In HPP, diminished TNSALP activity leads to extracellular accumulation of its natural substrates including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), an inhibitor of mineralization, and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the principal circulating form of vitamin B6 (B6). Autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance involving >450 usually missense defects scattered throughout ALPL largely explains the remarkably broad-ranging severity of this inborn-error-of-metabolism. In 1985 when we identified elevated plasma PLP as a biochemical hallmark of HPP, all 14 investigated affected children and adults had markedly increased PLP levels. However, pyridoxal (PL), the dephosphorylated form of PLP that enters cells to cofactor many enzymatic reactions, was not low but often inexplicably elevated. Levels of pyridoxic acid (PA), the B6 degradation product quantified to assess B6 sufficiency, were unremarkable. Canonical signs or symptoms of B6 deficiency or toxicity were absent. B6-dependent seizures in infants with life-threatening HPP were later explained by their profound deficiency of TNSALP activity blocking PLP dephosphorylation to PL and diminishing gamma-aminobutyric acid synthesis in the brain. Now, there is speculation that altered B6 metabolism causes further clinical complications in HPP. Herein, we assessed the plasma PL and PA levels accompanying previously reported elevated plasma PLP concentrations in 150 children and adolescents with HPP.

Twelve participants were treated with a single dose of 300 mg GBP (treatment A) or with 20 mg/d of CTZ for 5 days and 300 mg GBP on the last day of CTZ treatment (treatment B). Blood sampling and pain intensity evaluation were performed up to 36 hours after GBP administration. The interaction of GBP and CTZ with transporters for organic cations was studied in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing the organic cation transporters (OCTs), multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATEs), and OCTN1. CTZ treatment resulted in reduced area under the concentration-time curve and peak concentration compared with treatment A.

28,34531331,"Senescent cells, which arise due to damage-associated signals, are apoptosis-resistant and can express a pro-inflammatory, tissue-destructive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We recently reported that a component of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) surface protein, S1, can amplify the SASP of senescent cultured human cells and that a related mouse β-coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), increases SASP factors and senescent cell burden in infected mice. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 induces senescence in human non-senescent cells and exacerbates the SASP in human senescent cells through Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3). TLR-3, which senses viral RNA, was increased in human senescent compared to non-senescent cells. Notably, genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting TLR-3 prevented senescence induction and SASP amplification by SARS-CoV-2 or Spike pseudotyped virus. While an artificial TLR-3 agonist alone was not sufficient to induce senescence, it amplified the SASP in senescent human cells. Consistent with these findings, lung p16INK4a+ senescent cell burden was higher in patients who died from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection than other causes. Our results suggest that induction of cellular senescence and SASP amplification through TLR-3 contribute to SARS-CoV-2 morbidity, indicating that clinical trials of senolytics and/or SASP/TLR-3 inhibitors for alleviating acute and long-term SARS-CoV-2 sequelae are warranted.","Senescent cells are cells that are no longer able to divide but are still active. Senescent cells become active when damage-associated signals are triggered. These cells are resistant to cell death. They can also release tissue damaging, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This means these cells release high levels of inflammatory (infection-fighting) cells. The authors of this report recently reported that a protein associated with the coronavirus or virus for COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) can increase SASP within cultured (grown within a lab) human cells. Additionally, the authors reported that a specific strain of mouse coronavirus increases SASP and the amount of senescent cells within sickened mice. In this study, the authors demonstrate that COVID-19 causes cells to become senescent and overactive SASP in human senescent cells through a specific immune system receptor known as Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3). Immune receptors are structures that bind to the surface of a cell and causes a response. TLR-3 can detect virus RNA or genetic material. TLR-3 was increased in human senescent cells compared to those not in a state of senescence. The blocking of TLR-3 prevented senescence causation and SASP amplification from occurring following COVID-19 or Spike pseudo-typed virus (a virus manipulated to not replicate). An artificial TLR-3 agonist, a substance that induces a specific response similar to the original, was not strong enough to induce or cause senescence. However, it did amplify SASP in senescent human cells. Consistent with these findings, the amount of senescent cells within lungs was increased in patients who died from acute COVID-19 infection when compared to patients who passed away for other reasons. These results suggest increased cell senescence and SASP through TLR-3 contributed to COVID-19 death. This indicates that clinical trials of senolytics (drugs that only kill senescent cells) or SASP/TLR-3 inhibitors or blockers are needed.

46,33805605,"Cystic fibrosis is a monogenic, autosomal, recessive disease characterized by an alteration of chloride transport caused by mutations in the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene. The loss of Phe residue in position 508 (ΔF508-CFTR) causes an incorrect folding of the protein causing its degradation and electrolyte imbalance. CF patients are extremely predisposed to the development of a chronic inflammatory process of the bronchopulmonary system. When the cells of a tissue are damaged, the immune cells are activated and trigger the production of free radicals, provoking an inflammatory process. In addition to routine therapies, today drugs called correctors are available for mutations such as ΔF508-CFTR as well as for others less frequent ones. These active molecules are supposed to facilitate the maturation of the mutant CFTR protein, allowing it to reach the apical membrane of the epithelial cell. Matrine induces ΔF508-CFTR release from the endoplasmic reticulum to cell cytosol and its localization on the cell membrane. We now have evidence that Matrine and Lumacaftor not only restore the transport of mutant CFTR protein, but probably also counteract the inflammatory process by improving the course of the disease.","Cystic fibrosis is a deadly disease inherited from both parents characterized by changes in a compound (chloride) movement caused by genetic changes in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. One gene change, ΔF508-CFTR, causes the resulting protein the gene creates to fold incorrectly, which leads to its destruction and mineral imbalance. CF patients are at very high risk of developing long-term inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) of part of the lungs. When tissue cells are damaged, immune cells are stimulated and produce unstable molecules, prompting the immune system to defend the body. In addition to normal treatments, drugs called correctors are available for changes like ΔF508-CFTR and other less common changes. Correctors help the CFTR protein form the right shape to move to the surface of the epithelial cell (cell that covers outer surface of the internal organs). Matrine, a drug, starts ΔF508-CFTR release from the cell's transportation system through the cell liquid to the surface.

19,32804544,"Introduction: Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with levodopa is hampered by motor complications related to the inability of residual nigrostriatal neurons to convert levodopa to dopamine (DA) and use it appropriately. This generated a tendency to postpone levodopa, favoring the initial use of DA agonists, which directly stimulate striatal dopaminergic receptors. Use of DA agonists, however, is associated with multiple side effects and their efficacy is limited by suboptimal bioavailability. Areas covered: This paper reviewed the latest preclinical and clinical findings on the efficacy and adverse effects of non-ergot DA agonists, discussing the present and future of this class of compounds in PD therapy. Expert opinion: The latest findings confirm the effectiveness of DA agonists as initial treatment or adjunctive therapy to levodopa in advanced PD, but a more conservative approach to their use is emerging, due to the complexity and repercussions of their side effects. As various factors may increase the individual risk to side effects, assessing such risk and calibrating the use of DA agonists accordingly may become extremely important in the clinical management of PD, as well as the availability of new DA agonists with better profiles of safety and efficacy.","Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease with levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) is slowed down by motor (movement) complications related to the inability of neurons to convert levodopa to dopamine (a chemical messenger that carries signals between brain cells and affects mood, motivation, and movement) and use it appropriately. This problem often leads to delaying the use of levodopa and using dopamine agonists (a medication that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body to relieve symptoms related to low levels of dopamine), which directly stimulates dopamine receptors or target sites in the brain. Using dopamine agonists, however, is connected with multiple side effects. Their performance is limited by the drug not being completely available to the intended part of the body.

Identifying the genes that regulate the TS network is one of the main challenges in understanding its aetiology. Here, we studied the regulatory network from manually curated genes reported in the literature and identified essential proteins involved in TS. The power-law distribution analysis showed that TS network carries scale-free hierarchical fractal attributes. This organization of the network maintained the self-ruled constitution of nodes at various levels without having centrality-lethality control systems. Out of twenty-seven genes culminating into leading hubs in the network, we identified two key regulators (KRs) i.e. KDM6A and BDNF. These KRs serve as the backbone for all the network activities. Removal of KRs does not cause its breakdown, rather a change in the topological properties was observed. Since essential proteins are evolutionarily conserved, the orthologs of selected interacting proteins in C. elegans, cat and macaque monkey (lower to higher level organisms) were identified. We deciphered three important interologs i.e. KDM6A-WDR5, KDM6A-ASH2L and WDR5-ASH2L that form a triangular motif.

Data sources: PubMed was searched on December 12, 2017, for randomized, placebo-controlled trials examining the treatment of TD using the search terms (drug-induced dyskinesia OR tardive dyskinesia) AND (psychotic disorders OR schizophrenia). Study selection: Studies were included if they examined tardive dyskinesia treatment as the primary outcome and were randomized and placebo-controlled trials. Data extraction: The effect size (standard mean difference) of improvement (compared to placebo) stratified by medication class is reported for each of the trials included in this systematic review. A meta-analysis was conducted utilizing a fixed-effects model. Results: Vitamin E was associated with significantly greater reduction in TD symptoms compared to placebo (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.31 ± 0.08; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.46; z = 4.1; P < .001). There was significant evidence of publication bias in vitamin E studies (Egger test: P = .02). Shorter duration of treatment and lower dose of vitamin E were significantly associated with greater measured treatment benefit. Vitamin B₆ was associated with significantly greater reduction in TD symptoms compared to placebo (SMD = 1.41 ± 0.22; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.85; z = 6.4; P < .001) in 2 trials conducted by the same research group. Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors demonstrated significant benefit on tardive dyskinesia symptoms compared to placebo (SMD = 0.63 ± 0.11; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.85; z = 5.58; P < .005). Amantadine was associated with significantly greater score reduction compared to placebo (SMD = 0.46 ± 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.87; z = 2.20; P < .05).

Conclusions: Data from multiple trials suggests that VMAT2 inhibitors, vitamin E, vitamin B₆, and amantadine may be effective for the treatment of TD. Evidence of publication bias and a significant negative association of dose and duration of treatment with measured efficacy suggest that the benefits of vitamin E in TD may be overstated.

We included studies if they looked at treatment of TD as the main result and randomly assigned participants to groups receiving TD treatment or sugar pills. We used statistical methods to combine the results of multiple studies. Results favored vitamin E over sugar pills in TD symptom reduction. The results of the published vitamin E studies were different from results of unpublished studies. Taking vitamin E for a shorter amount of time and at a lower dose was associated with greater TD symptom reduction. Results favored vitamin B6 over sugar pills in TD symptom reduction. Results favored vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), over sugar pills in TD symptom reduction. Results favored amantadine - a dopamine promoter - over sugar pills. Results did not favor calcium channel blockers, which block transport of calcium in the body, over sugar pills. We conclude that many studies show that VMAT2 inhibitors, vitamin E, vitamin B₆, and amantadine may work to treat TD. Because results of the published vitamin E studies were different from results of unpublished studies and taking vitamin E for a shorter amount of time and at a lower dose was associated with greater TD symptom reduction, the benefits of vitamin E in TD might not be as great as studies suggest.

Recent findings: Although oral LT4 tablets are most commonly used for thyroid hormone replacement in patients with hypothyroidism, case studies report that liquid oral LT4, intravenous, intramuscular, and rectal administration of LT4 can successfully treat refractory hypothyroidism. Summary: Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders encountered by primary care physicians and endocrinologists. LT4 is one of the most widely prescribed medications in the world and it is the standard of care treatment for hypothyroidism. Generally, hypothyroid patients will be treated with LT4 tablets to be taken orally, and monitoring will occur with routine serum thyroid tests, including TSH concentrations. However, many patients fail to maintain serum TSH levels in the target range while managed on oral LT4 tablets. A subset of these patients would be considered to have poorly controlled hypothyroidism, sometimes termed refractory hypothyroidism. For these patients, optimization of ingestion routines and alternative formulations and routes of administration of LT4 can be considered, including oral liquid, intravenous, intramuscular, and even rectal formulations.","This article aims to cover the basics of how well levothyroxine (LT4 - a common thyroid medication) is absorbed when taken by mouth, reasons why people may have continuously high blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, and other ways to take levothyroxine.

There is emerging evidence for the management of non-motor symptoms (symptoms unrelated to movement such as lack of pain or tiredness) in Parkinson's disease, and the importance of multidisciplinary care (when professionals from different fields work together to deliver comprehensive care that addresses the patient's needs). In this article, the evidence foundation for the best diagnosis and care of Parkinson's disease is discussed.",,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed where bradykinesia occurs together with rigidity or tremor, in the presence of supporting features. the diagnosis is clinical, and attention should be paid to exclusion criteria indicating an alternative diagnosis and to'red flag' features. The most effective symptomatic treatment remains levodopa, which has superior benefits for quality of life in early PD compared to other therapies."
28,34578187,"SARS-CoV-2 infection has caused a global pandemic that has severely damaged both public health and the economy. The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is multifunctional and plays an important role in ribonucleocapsid formation and viral genome replication. In order to elucidate its functions, interaction partners of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in human cells were identified via affinity purification and mass spectrometry. We identified 160 cellular proteins as interaction partners of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in HEK293T and/or Calu-3 cells. Functional analysis revealed strong enrichment for ribosome biogenesis and RNA-associated processes, including ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, ribosomal large and small subunits biogenesis, RNA binding, catalysis, translation and transcription. Proteins related to virus defence responses, including MOV10, EIF2AK2, TRIM25, G3BP1, ZC3HAV1 and ZCCHC3 were also identified in the N protein interactome. This study comprehensively profiled the viral-host interactome of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in human cells, and the findings provide the basis for further studies on the pathogenesis and antiviral strategies for this emerging infection.","SARS-CoV-2 infection, also known as COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease), has caused a global pandemic that has hurt both public health and the economy. A protein of the virus has several purposes and plays an important role in creating the protective outer shell of the virus and helping the virus replicate itself. In order to better understand how the virus protein works, proteins within human cells that interact with the COVID-19 protein were identified. The authors identified 160 proteins within two different human cell types that interact in some way with the COVID-19 protein. The human proteins found to interact with the virus protein are responsible for several cell functions, all of which impact the creation of more proteins. Additionally, some human proteins identified to interact with the virus protein have roles in defending the body from viruses. This study thoroughly characterized how the viral protein and the host (or human) protein interact when a person is infected.

27,34581763,"Importance: Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) has been reported after vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson). Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with and without TTS. Design, setting, and participants: This cohort study used data from an international registry of consecutive patients with CVST within 28 days of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination included between March 29 and June 18, 2021, from 81 hospitals in 19 countries. For reference, data from patients with CVST between 2015 and 2018 were derived from an existing international registry. Clinical characteristics and mortality rate were described for adults with (1) CVST in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, (2) CVST after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination not fulling criteria for TTS, and (3) CVST unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Exposures: Patients were classified as having TTS if they had new-onset thrombocytopenia without recent exposure to heparin, in accordance with the Brighton Collaboration interim criteria. Main outcomes and measures: Clinical characteristics and mortality rate. Results: Of 116 patients with postvaccination CVST, 78 (67.2%) had TTS, of whom 76 had been vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCov-19; 38 (32.8%) had no indication of TTS. The control group included 207 patients with CVST before the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 63 of 78 (81%), 30 of 38 (79%), and 145 of 207 (70.0%) patients, respectively, were female, and the mean (SD) age was 45 (14), 55 (20), and 42 (16) years, respectively. Concomitant thromboembolism occurred in 25 of 70 patients (36%) in the TTS group, 2 of 35 (6%) in the no TTS group, and 10 of 206 (4.9%) in the control group, and in-hospital mortality rates were 47% (36 of 76; 95% CI, 37-58), 5% (2 of 37; 95% CI, 1-18), and 3.9% (8 of 207; 95% CI, 2.0-7.4), respectively. The mortality rate was 61% (14 of 23) among patients in the TTS group diagnosed before the condition garnered attention in the scientific community and 42% (22 of 53) among patients diagnosed later. Conclusions and relevance: In this cohort study of patients with CVST, a distinct clinical profile and high mortality rate was observed in patients meeting criteria for TTS after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is a rare condition of blood clots in the veins and arteries and low blood platelet counts. TTS has been reported in some people after they receive the AstraZeneca and Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccines. These vaccines provide immunity or resistance to the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19 (a viral, respiratory disease). The objective of this study is to describe the clinical traits and outcomes of patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) (blood clot in the brain) after receiving the coronavirus vaccine among people with and without TTS. This study uses data from patients who have CVST within 28 days of vaccination in March-June 2021. Data came from 81 hospitals in 19 countries. Existing data from patients with CVST between 2015 and 2018 are used to compare. Clinical traits and death are described for adults with (1) CVST in the case of coronavirus vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, (2) CVST after coronavirus vaccination not meeting all parts for TTS, and (3) CVST unrelated to the coronavirus vaccination. Patients are classified as having TTS (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome) if they have new thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets) without recent exposure to heparin, a medicine that prevents blood clots. Clinical traits and deaths are the main measures in this study. Of the 116 patients with CVST after being vaccinated, 78 (67.2%) have TTS. Of those, 76 people had been vaccinated with AstraZeneca and 38 (32.8%) have no indication of TTS. The comparison group included 207 patients with CVST before the Covid-19 pandemic.

53,33022987,"To date, nutritional studies have focused on the total intake of dietary fiber rather than intake timing. In this study, we examined the effect of the timing of daily Helianthus tuberosus ingestion on postprandial and 24 h glucose levels, as well as on intestinal microbiota in older adults. In total, 37 healthy older adults (age = 74.9 ± 0.8 years) were recruited. The participants were randomly assigned to either a morning group (MG, n = 18) or an evening group (EG, n = 17). The MG and EG groups were instructed to take Helianthus tuberosus powder (5 g/day) just before breakfast or dinner, respectively, for 1 week after the 1-week control period. The glucose levels of all participants were monitored using a continuous glucose monitoring system throughout the 2 weeks. The intestinal microbiota was analyzed by sequencing 16S rRNA genes from feces before and after the intervention. There were no significant differences in the physical characteristics or energy intake between groups. Helianthus tuberosus intake led to decreases in tissue glucose levels throughout the day in both groups (p < 0.01, respectively). As a result of examining the fluctuations in tissue glucose levels up to 4 hours after each meal, significant decreases in the areas under the curves (AUCs) were observed for all three meals after intervention, but only in the MG (breakfast: p = 0.012, lunch: p = 0.002, dinner: p = 0.005). On the other hand, in the EG, there was a strong decrease in the AUC after dinner, but only slight decreases after breakfast and lunch (breakfast: p = 0.017, lunch: p = 0.427, dinner: p = 0.002). Moreover, the rate of change in the peak tissue glucose level at breakfast was significantly decreased in the MG compared to the EG (p = 0.027). A greater decrease was observed in the change in the blood glucose level after the ingestion of Helianthus tuberosus in the MG than in the EG. Furthermore, the relative abundance of Ruminococcus in the MG at the genus level was significantly higher at baseline than in the EG (p = 0.016) and it was also significantly lower after the intervention (p = 0.013). Our findings indicate that Helianthus tuberosus intake in the morning might have relatively stronger effects on the intestinal microbiota and suppress postprandial glucose levels to a greater extent than when taken in the evening.","To date, nutritional studies have focused on the total amount of dietary fiber consumed rather than when the fiber was consumed. In this study, researchers examine the effect of the timing of daily ingestion of Jerusalem artichoke (sunroot, Helianthus tuberosus) on blood sugar levels after meals and at 24 hours, as well as on gut bacteria in older adults. In total, 37 healthy older adults (age = 74.9 ± 0.8 years) are recruited. The participants are randomly assigned to either a morning group (18 participants) or an evening group (17 participants). The morning group is instructed to take Jerusalem artichoke powder just before breakfast, and the evening group to take it just before dinner. Each group took the powder for 1 week. The blood sugar levels of all participants are monitored using a continuous blood sugar monitoring system throughout the 2 weeks. The gut bacteria is analyzed from feces (poop) before and after participants consumed the Jerusalem artichoke. There are no significant differences in the physical characteristics or the amount of calories consumed between groups. Consuming Jerusalem artichoke leads to decreases in tissue blood sugar levels throughout the day in both groups. As a result of examining the changes in tissue blood glucose levels up to 4 hours after each meal, big decreases in the overall exposure to the Jerusalem artichoke in the body is observed for all three meals after intervention (treatment), but only in the morning group. On the other hand, in the evening group, there is a strong decrease in the overall exposure to the plant after dinner, but only slight decreases after breakfast and lunch. Additionally, the rate of change in the max tissue blood sugar level at breakfast is significantly decreased in the morning group compared to the evening group. A greater decrease is observed in the change in the blood sugar level after the ingestion of Jerusalem artichoke in the morning group than in the evening group. Furthermore, the relative abundance of a gut bacteria that can break down fiber called Ruminococcus in the morning group is much higher at the start of the study than in the evening group, and it is also much lower after the study. The findings suggest that consuming Jerusalem artichoke in the morning might have relatively stronger effects on the gut bacteria and slow post-meal blood sugar levels to a greater extent than when taken in the evening.",,"MG and EG groups were instructed to take Helianthus tuberosus powder (5 g/day) just before breakfast or dinner, respectively, for 1 week after the 1-week control period. the intestinal microbiota was analyzed by sequencing 16S rRNA genes from feces before and after intervention. a greater decrease was observed in the peak tissue glucose level at breakfast, but only slight decreases after breakfast and lunch (p = 0.002)."
51,8786012,"We studied the effect of severe reduction of beta-cell mass by 90% pancreatectomy on the immune tolerance to the endocrine pancreas. Four months after subtotal pancreatectomy all LEW.Han rats had developed mononuclear infiltration of islets and 9 of 14 rats were positive for islet-cell antibodies. Electron microscopy revealed lymphocytic invasion of endocrine tissue, lysis of beta cells and phagocytotic macrophages. None of these changes were seen 2 weeks after 90% pancreatectomy or 4 months after 10% pancreatectomy. Weekly substitution of islet antigens in the form of a homogenate of 100 islets into 90% pancreatectomized LEW.Han rats almost completely prevented the development of insulitis and autoantibodies. The dependence of insulitis on T cells was shown when 90% pancreatectomy in LEW.rnu rats (i.e., the congenic athymic nude strain), did not result in islet infiltration. The exocrine tissue remained normal in all experimental groups. During the observation period insulitis was not associated with overt diabetes but was accompanied by substantial enlargement of islets and of beta-cell mass, as shown by morphometry. Suppression of islet inflammation by injection of islet antigens abolished beta-cell regeneration, despite continuing metabolic stress in rats with 90% pancreatectomy. The findings indicate induction of islet autoimmunity in response to 90% but not to 10% pancreatectomy. We conclude that severe reduction of the islet-antigen mass allows the development of T-cell-dependent islet autoimmunity which indicates a loss of immune tolerance. In addition, the data suggest the existence of islet-antigen autoreactive immune cells in rats not genetically predisposed to autoimmune diabetes. Finally, we conclude that selective beta-cell regeneration occurs in association with insulitis.","We studied the effect of drastically reducing beta-cell (insulin-producing cell) mass by removing 90% of the pancreas on immune tolerance (state of unresponsiveness of the body's defense) to the endocrine pancreas, which controls blood sugar levels. Four months after removal of almost all of the pancreas, all rats had developed signs of long-term inflammation (infection-fighting) response of islets (clusters of cells that produce hormones) and 9 of 14 rats had islet-cell antibodies (proteins made against insulin-producing cells). Using microscopes, we saw immune white blood cells going into the part of the pancreas that produces substances (enzymes) that help with digestion, death of beta cells, and white blood cells that remove dying and dead cells. We saw none of these changes 2 weeks after removing 90% of the pancreas or 4 months after removing 10% of the pancreas. Weekly substitution of islet antigens (substances that causes the body to defend itself) in rats with 90% of the pancreas removed prevented insulitis (disease of the pancreas caused by the infiltration of immune white blood cells) and self-made proteins. Insulitis was shown to be dependent on T cells (part of the body's defense system). The tissue that produces substances (enzymes) that help with digestion did not change in any group. During the observation period, insulitis was not related to diabetes, but we saw a sizeable increase in the sizes of islets and beta-cell mass. Decreasing islet inflammation by injecting islet antigens (fragments) stopped beta-cell regrowth, even though low energy continued in rats with 90% of the pancreas removed. The results suggest removing 90% but not 10% of the pancreas causes the body to mistakenly destroy its islets. We conclude that drastically reducing the islet-antigen mass allows the body to mistakenly destroy its islets, which shows a loss of immune tolerance. Also, the results suggest islet-antigen autoreactive immune cells exist in rats not likely to develop autoimmune diabetes (diabetes from the body mistakenly destroying its own cells). Finally, we conclude that some beta-cell regrowth happens with insulitis.",,"the dependence of insulitis on T cells was shown when 90% pancreatectomy in LEW.rnu rats (i.e., the congenic athymic nude strain), did not result in islet infiltration. the exocrine tissue remained normal in all experimental groups, as shown by morphometry.

25,34409778,"Hyperinflammation and cytokine storm has been noted as a poor prognostic factor in patients with severe pneumonia related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In COVID-19, pathogenic myeloid cell overactivation is found to be a vital mediator of damage to tissues, hypercoagulability, and the cytokine storm. These cytokines unselectively infiltrate various tissues, such as the lungs and heart, and nervous system. This cytokine storm can hence cause multi-organ dysfunction and life-threatening complications. Mavrilimumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that may be helpful in some cases with COVID-19. During an inflammation, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release is crucial to driving both innate and adaptive immune responses. The GM-CSF immune response is triggered when an antigen attaches to the host cell and induces the signaling pathway. Mavrilimumab antagonizes the action of GM-CSF and decreases the hyperinflammation associated with pneumonia in COVID-19, therefore strengthening the rationale that mavrilimumab when added to the standard protocol of treatment could improve the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, specifically those patients with pneumonia. With this review paper, we aim to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of mavrilimumab on cytokine storms in patients with COVID-19 by reviewing published clinical trials and emphasize the importance of extensive future trials.","Patients with severe pneumonia or lung infections related to COVID-19 (a viral breathing-related disease) may also have an overactive immune response and cytokine storm, which is when the immune system floods the body with proteins called cytokines. These events are associated with poor outcomes. In COVID-19, excessive activity of immune cells is linked to tissue damage, an increased risk of blood clots, and the cytokine storm. The cytokines enter different tissues, such as the lungs and heart, and the nervous system (the spinal cord, brain, and nerves). This cytokine storm can cause multiple organs to not work properly and cause life-threatening complications. Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. One type of monoclonal antibody that may help some COVID-19 cases is mavrilimumab. During inflammation, the release of a GM-CSF, another type of protein that controls the body's immune responses, is necessary for proper immune responses. These proteins are triggered when a foreign substance attaches to a cell and creates a path for cells to communicate and pass information. Mavrilimumab disrupts the action of GM-CSF and decreases the severe inflammation associated with pneumonia in COVID-19. Therefore, adding mavrilimumab to the standard treatment may improve the condition of COVID-19 patients, especially those with pneumonia. This paper reviews data from published studies to show how mavrilimumab can block cytokine storms in patients with COVID-19, and to highlight the importance of future studies.","Hyperinflammation and overproduction of inflammatory molecules is a poor predictor of recovery in patients with severe pneumonia (an infection that inflames air sacs in lungs) related to the viral respiratory disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In COVID-19, disease-causing white blood cell overactivation is a key mediator of damage to tissues, increased blood clots, and inflammatory molecule overproduction. These inflammatory molecules invade many body parts like the lungs, heart, and nervous system. This overproduction of inflammatory molecules can cause multi-organ damage and life-threatening issues. Mavrilimumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb), which binds to only one site of a foreign organism. It may aid some cases of COVID-19. During inflammation, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release, release of molecules that activate specific white blood cells, is crucial for an immune response. The GM-CSF immune response is triggered when a foreign organism attaches to a cell and activates a signal. Mavrilimumab combats the effect of GM-CSF and reduces hyperinflammation linked to pneumonia in COVID-19. This effect stregthens the idea that mavrilimumab, when added to standard treatment, may improve health outcomes in COVID-19 patients, specifically those with pneumonia.

8,33099901,"In the effort to improve treatment effectiveness in glioblastoma, this short note reviewed collected data on the pathophysiology of glioblastoma with particular reference to intersections with the pharmacology of perphenazine. That study identified five areas of potentially beneficial intersection. Data showed seemingly 5 independent perphenazine attributes of benefit to glioblastoma treatment - i) blocking dopamine receptor 2, ii) reducing centrifugal migration of subventricular zone cells by blocking dopamine receptor 3, iii) blocking serotonin receptor 7, iv) activation of protein phosphatase 2, and v) nausea reduction. Perphenazine is fully compatible with current chemoirradiation protocols and with the commonly used ancillary medicines used in clinical practice during the course of glioblastoma. All these attributes argue for a trial of perphenazine's addition to current standard treatment with temozolomide and irradiation. The subventricular zone seeds the brain with mutated cells that become recurrent glioblastoma after centrifugal migration. The current paper shows how perphenazine might reduce that contribution. Perphenazine is an old, generic, cheap, phenothiazine antipsychotic drug that has been in continuous clinical use worldwide since the 1950's. Clinical experience and research data over these decades have shown perphenazine to be well-tolerated in psychiatric populations, in normals, and in non-psychiatric, medically ill populations for whom perphenazine is used to reduce nausea. For now (Summer, 2020) the nature of glioblastoma requires a polypharmacy approach until/unless a core feature and means to address it can be identified in the future. Conclusions: Perphenazine possesses a remarkable constellation of attributes that recommend its use in GB treatment.","To improve how well treatment for glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, works, we looked at studies on the disease-related processes associated with glioblastoma and their interaction with how the antipsychotic perphenazine affects the body. That study found five areas of possibly helpful interaction. Studies showed 5 independent qualities of perphenazine that might help treat glioblastoma, including changing how cells grow and move and reducing nausea. Perphenazine can be taken with current chemotherapy and radiation treatments and with commonly prescribed glioblastoma drugs. These qualities suggest the addition of perphenazine to current chemotherapy and radiation treatment should be studied. Part of the brain sends out damaged cells that become recurring glioblastoma after they move outward. This paper shows how perphenazine might decrease this activity. Perphenazine is an old, generic, cheap drug used to treat psychotic disorders worldwide since the 1950s. Studies over time have shown perphenazine does not cause many side effects in normal people, people with mental illness, and ill people taking perphenazine to reduce nausea. As of Summer 2020, glioblastoma requires multiple drugs to treat it until and unless it is better understood and a single treatment drug is found. We conclude that perphenazine has many qualities that suggest its use in treating glioblastoma.","To try improving treatment in glioblastoma (a brain cancer), this work collected data on the cancer's symptoms and traits along with references to perphenazine (an anti-psychotic medication).

7,25229278,"Acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis, which is characterized by inflammation of the posterior pharynx and tonsils, is a common disease. Several viruses and bacteria can cause acute pharyngitis; however, Streptococcus pyogenes (also known as Lancefield group A β-hemolytic streptococci) is the only agent that requires an etiologic diagnosis and specific treatment. S. pyogenes is of major clinical importance because it can trigger post-infection systemic complications, acute rheumatic fever, and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Symptom onset in streptococcal infection is usually abrupt and includes intense sore throat, fever, chills, malaise, headache, tender enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes, and pharyngeal or tonsillar exudate. Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea are uncommon, and their presence suggests a viral cause. A diagnosis of pharyngitis is supported by the patient's history and by the physical examination. Throat culture is the gold standard for diagnosing streptococcus pharyngitis. However, it has been underused in public health services because of its low availability and because of the 1- to 2-day delay in obtaining results. Rapid antigen detection tests have been used to detect S. pyogenes directly from throat swabs within minutes. Clinical scoring systems have been developed to predict the risk of S. pyogenes infection. The most commonly used scoring system is the modified Centor score. Acute S. pyogenes pharyngitis is often a self-limiting disease. Penicillins are the first-choice treatment. For patients with penicillin allergy, cephalosporins can be an acceptable alternative, although primary hypersensitivity to cephalosporins can occur. Another drug option is the macrolides. Future perspectives to prevent streptococcal pharyngitis and post-infection systemic complications include the development of an anti-Streptococcus pyogenes vaccine.","Immediate pharyngitis/tonsillitis, characterized by inflammation of the pharynx (an airway in the throat) and tonsils, is a common disease. Many viruses and bacteria can cause immediate pharyngitis (throat inflammation). However, only Streptoccocus pyogenes (a specific bacteria) needs identification and specific treatment. S. pyogenes, a specific bacteria, is important since it can trigger post-infection issues, immediate rheumatic fever, and kidney disease. Symptoms start abruptly in strep bacterial infection and include intense sore throat, fever, chills, fatigue, headache, enlarged neck lymph nodes, and pharyngeal or tonsillar fluid leakage. Cough, nose and eye inflammation, and diarrhea are uncommon. Their presence suggests a viral cause. Identifying pharynx, or throat, inflammation is supported by patient history and physical examination. Testing throat cells are the gold standard for identifying strep throat. However, testing isolated throat cells is underused due to its low availability and 1- to 2-day delay for results. Rapid antigen, or foreign protein, detection tests may detect bacterial S. pyogenes from throat swabs in minutes. Medical scoring systems have been created to predict risk of S. pyogenes bacterial infection. The most common scoring system is the modified Centor score. Immediate strep throat is often a self-resolving disease. Penicillins, or antibacterial drugs, are the first-choice treatment. For patients with penicillin allergy, cephalosporins (another antibacterial) can be an alternative. Although, immediate immune responses to cephalosporins can occur. Another antibiotic option is macrolides. Future options to prevent strep throat and associated issues include developing an anti-Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial vaccine.","Sore throat/tonsillitis, or when the back of the throat or tonsils is inflamed, is common. Many viruses and bacteria can cause short-term sore throat. However, group A strep, caused by Group A strep bacteria, is the only cause that must be identified based on signs and symptoms and treated. Group A strep bacteria are important to identify because they can cause post-strep throat complications throughout the body, acute rheumatic fever (a disease that inflames the body's tissues), and post-strep throat kidney disease. Strep throat symptoms usually happen quickly and include severe sore throat, fever, chills, general discomfort, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck, and white or yellow spots on the throat or tonsils. Cough, cold symptoms, pink eye, and diarrhea are not common and might be caused by a virus. Learning the person's history and doing a physical exam are used to diagnose strep throat. A throat swab to find, grow, and test bacteria in the throat that make you sick is the best way to diagnose strep throat. However, it has not been used as much as it should because it is not widely available and takes 1 to 2 days to get results. Rapid strep tests have been used to find fragments of bacteria that cause strep throat from swabs within minutes. Scoring systems have been made to predict the risk of strep throat. The modified Centor score is the most common scoring survey. Short-term strep throat often goes away on its own without treatment. Penicillins, a type of antibiotics, are prescribed most commonly. For people allergic to penicillin, cephalosporins, another type of antibiotics, can be prescribed, although people can be allergic to cephalosporins. Another drug option is macrolides, another type of antibiotics. Making an anti-strep throat vaccine could be one way to prevent strep throat and post-strep throat complications throughout the body in the future.","Streptococcus pyogenes is the only agent that requires an etiologic diagnosis and specific treatment. it can trigger post-infection systemic complications, acute rheumatic fever, chills, malaise, headache, tender enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes, and pharyngeal or tonsillar exudate.

26,32941052,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread globally in a few short months. Substantial evidence now supports preliminary conclusions about transmission that can inform rational, evidence-based policies and reduce misinformation on this critical topic. This article presents a comprehensive review of the evidence on transmission of this virus. Although several experimental studies have cultured live virus from aerosols and surfaces hours after inoculation, the real-world studies that detect viral RNA in the environment report very low levels, and few have isolated viable virus. Strong evidence from case and cluster reports indicates that respiratory transmission is dominant, with proximity and ventilation being key determinants of transmission risk. In the few cases where direct contact or fomite transmission is presumed, respiratory transmission has not been completely excluded. Infectiousness peaks around a day before symptom onset and declines within a week of symptom onset, and no late linked transmissions (after a patient has had symptoms for about a week) have been documented. The virus has heterogeneous transmission dynamics: Most persons do not transmit virus, whereas some cause many secondary cases in transmission clusters called ""superspreading events."" Evidence-based policies and practices should incorporate the accumulating knowledge about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to help educate the public and slow the spread of this virus.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 (a viral lung infection). Within a short period of time, SARS-CoV-2 has spread around the world. A significant amount of strong scientific evidence now backs up the initial thoughts on how COVID spreads from one person to another. This can improve current policies surrounding COVID-19 health safety rules and prevent the spread of false information. This paper offers a thorough review of the scientific reports concerning the spread of COVID-19. Several laboratory studies have been able to grow live COVID-19 viruses from the air and surfaces, even several hours after the virus was placed there. However, real-world studies that detect COVID-19 genetic material in the environment report very low levels. Few have been able to grow the virus from these samples. Strong evidence from cases and outbreaks shows that COVID-19 mostly spreads through the airways (lungs, throat, nose, and mouth). Distance and ventilation are key factors for risk of spreading COVID-19. Even in the few cases where scientists think the virus spread through contact with people or surfaces, spreading through the airways has not been ruled out. The rate that a person spreads the virus is highest a day before symptoms appear and declines within a week of symptoms appearing. The spread of the COVID-19 virus is different for each person. Most people infected do not spread COVID-19. However, some people infected with COVID-19 can cause many infections in groups, known as ""superspreading events.""

With the most common type (type I or sliding hiatus hernia) this is associated with laxity of the phrenooesophageal membrane and the gastric cardia herniates. Sliding hiatus hernia is readily diagnosed by barium swallow radiography, endoscopy, or manometry when greater than 2 cm in axial span. However, the mobility of the oesophagogastric junction precludes the reliable detection of more subtle disruption by endoscopy or radiography.

The importance of mitochondria in inflammatory pathologies, besides providing energy, is associated with the release of mitochondrial damage products, such as mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA), which may perpetuate inflammation. In this review, we aimed to show the importance of mitochondria, as organelles that produce energy and intervene in multiple pathologies, focusing mainly in COVID-19 and using multiple molecular mechanisms that allow for the replication and maintenance of the viral genome, leading to the exacerbation and spread of the inflammatory response. The evidence suggests that mitochondria are implicated in the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which forms double-membrane vesicles and evades detection by the cell defense system. These mitochondrion-hijacking vesicles damage the integrity of the mitochondrion's membrane, releasing mt-DNA into circulation and triggering the activation of innate immunity, which may contribute to an exacerbation of the pro-inflammatory state. Conclusions. While mitochondrial dysfunction in COVID-19 continues to be studied, the use of mt-DNA as an indicator of prognosis and severity is a potential area yet to be explored.","Mitochondria (the powerhouse of a cell) play several important roles in the body. These roles include providing energy and participating in pathways of inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection). The event of mitochondria increasing inflammation is associated with the release of products from mitochondrial damage. One of these products is mitochondrial DNA which can increase inflammation within the body. This review aimed to show the importance of the mitochondria in energy production and in the intervention in the development of several diseases, mainly COVID-19 (a viral, respiratory disease). Additionally the paper aimed to show how the mitochondria organelle uses several different ways to allow the replication and maintenance of a virus. This can lead to the worsening and spread of inflammation. The reviewed scientific evidence suggested that mitochondria are involved in the replication of COVID-19. The virus forms double-walled vesicles, a small chamber outside or within a cell, that evades detection by the host's immune system. These vesicles can then damage mitochondria within cells, releasing mitochondrial DNA into the body. This can trigger the innate immune system, the defense system you were born with, which increase inflammation within the body.

Methods: Health care personnel (HCP) at Cleveland Clinic diagnosed with COVID-19, who recovered without needing hospitalization, were identified. Threshold cycles (Ct) for positive PCR tests were obtained and viral loads calculated. The association of viral load with days since symptom onset was examined in a multivariable regression model, which was reduced by stepwise backward selection to only keep variables significant at a level of .05. Viral loads by day since symptom onset were predicted using the model and transmission potential evaluated by examination of a viral load-time curve. Results: Over 6 weeks, 230 HCP had 528 tests performed. Viral loads declined by orders of magnitude within a few days of symptom onset. The only variable significantly associated with viral load was time since onset of symptoms. Of the area under the curve (AUC) spanning symptom onset to 30 days, 96.9% lay within the first 7 days, and 99.7% within 10 days. Findings were very similar when validated using split-sample and 10-fold cross-validation.

Despite the deep level of understanding of immunophenotypic differentiation pathways in hematopoietic cells, few studies have investigated global levels of histone PTMs required for differentiation and maintenance of these distinct cell types. Here, we describe an approach to couple fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with targeted mass spectrometry to define global ""epi-proteomic"" signatures for primary leukocytes. FACS was used to sort closely and distantly related leukocytes from normal human peripheral blood for quantitation of histone PTMs with a multiple reaction monitoring LC-MS/MS method measuring histone PTMs on histones H3 and H4. We validate cell sorting directly into H2SO4 for immediate histone extraction to decrease time and number of steps after FACS to analyze histone PTMs. Relative histone PTM levels vary in T cells across healthy donors, and the majority of PTMs remain stable up to 2 days following initial blood draw. Large differences in the levels of histone PTMs are observed across the mature lymphoid and myeloid lineages, as well as between different types within the same lineage, though no differences are observed in closely related T cell subtypes. The results show a streamlined approach for quantifying global changes in histone PTMs in cell types separated by FACS that is poised for clinical deployment.","Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Changes to the properties and make-up of proteins, a process called post-translational modifications (PTMs), are important for regulating chromatin (a substance within a chromosome made up of DNA and protein) and how information from genes are used. Few studies have investigated all the levels of histone PTMs that are needed for dividing cells, changing their functions, and maintaining these specific cell types. This study uses an approach called fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with another technique called targeted mass spectrometry to detect and sort specific white blood cells that infection. FACS is used to sort closely and distantly related white blood cells from normal human blood moving throughout the body. Researchers tested and confirmed the method to sort cells to decrease time and number of steps after FACS to analyze histone changes. In healthy donors, histone PTM levels are different in immune cells called T cells, and most of PTMs stay stable for up to 2 days after blood is drawn. Large differences in the levels of histone PTMs are found across the mature, functioning blood cells, though no differences are found in closely related T cell subtypes.

50,28756540,"Background: There is no agreeing if rescue therapy can avoid short-term colectomy in patients treated for severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. Aims: The aim of our study was to identify predictors of response to infliximab and cyclosporine A. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 49 patients with severe ulcerative colitis were included. Response to therapy was defined as three or more point reductions in Mayo score after 6 months of treatment and avoidance of colectomy after 1 year. The predictors analysed were gender, age, time from ulcerative colitis diagnosis, months of steroid or/and azathioprine therapy before onset of the severe phase, smoking habits, extension of the disease, laboratory analyses and Mayo score. Results: Patients treated with infliximab showed a statistically significant higher response rate in case of moderate Mayo score (P = 0.04). Ex-smokers had very low chance of response to infliximab (P = 0.03). In the group treated with cyclosporine A, patients with C-reactive protein >3 mg/L had a response rate significantly higher than those with C-reactive protein <3 mg/L (P = 0.03); those with negative C-reactive protein and moderate Mayo score did not responded to therapy, while in the ones with elevated C-reactive protein and/or severe Mayo score, 15 versus 4 responded (P = 0.008). Conclusions: Our data suggest that cyclosporine A is advisable in ex-smokers. In never smokers or active smokers, infliximab can be prescribed in case of Mayo score ≤10 and/or negative CRP, while cyclosporine A is indicated in case of Mayo score >10 and positive CRP.","It is unknown if rescue therapy, or therapy given after an ailment does not respond to normal treatment, can avoid colectomy (removal of all or parts of colon) in patients treated for severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. Steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis is chronic inflammatory bowel disease that no longer responds to steroid treatment. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of response to infliximab and cyclosporine A, drugs that aim to improve the immune system. In this study, 49 patients with severe ulcerative colitis were included. Response to therapy was characterized as three or more point reductions in Mayo score (a disease ranking system) after 6 months of treatment and avoidance of colectomy after 1 year. Increased Mayo score indicated worsened disease condition. The predictors evaluated were gender, age, time from ulcerative colitis diagnosis, months of steroid or/and azathioprine therapy before onset of the severe phase, smoking habits, extension of the disease, laboratory analyses and Mayo score. Azathioprine is a medication given to improve immune function. Patients treated with infliximab showed a statistically significant higher response rate in case of moderate Mayo score. Ex-smokers had very low chance of response to infliximab. In the group treated with cyclosporine A, patients with a higher volume of C-reactive protein had a response rate significantly higher than those with lower C-reactive protein volume. Patients with negative (no detected) C-reactive protein volume and moderate Mayo score did not responded to therapy. Patients with elevated C-reactive protein and/or severe Mayo score predominately respond. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). This study suggests that cyclosporine A is advisable as treatment in ex-smokers. In never smokers or active smokers, infliximab can be prescribed in case of Mayo score ≤10 and/or negative CRP. However, cyclosporine A is indicated as a better option in case of Mayo score >10 and positive CRP.",,"49 patients with severe ulcerative colitis were included in this cross-sectional study.

Study assessments at specific time points included developmental and neurocognitive testing, patient log books, and investigator and parental questionnaires. A systematic literature review was also performed. Results: Nineteen patients were assessed, the majority having prenatal disease onset. Patients were treated with ketogenic diet for a median of 2.9 years. All patients alive at the time of data registration at a median age of 6 years. The treatment had a positive effect mainly in the areas of epilepsy, ataxia, sleep disturbance, speech/language development, social functioning, and frequency of hospitalizations. It was also safe-except in one patient who discontinued because of acute pancreatitis. The median plasma concentration of ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyric acid) was 3.3 mmol/l. Poor dietary compliance was associated with relapsing ataxia and stagnation of motor and neurocognitive development. Results of neurocognitive testing are reported for 12 of 19 patients.

Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) binds to the catalytic domain of PAH and is a cofactor for this reaction. PAH is primarily a hepatic enzyme. Elevated blood Phe levels and decreased Tyr levels characterize PKU. Newborns with PKU can appear normal at birth with the first signs appearing after several months. These signs can include musty odor from skin and urine, fair skin, eczema, seizures, tremors, and hyperactivity.","Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disorder in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy often caused by not enough of a specific protein (phenylalanine hydroxylase, PAH) that changes one molecule (phenylalanine, Phe) into another molecule (tyrosine, Tyr). PKU is a type of molecular (amino acid) metabolism disorder called ""toxic accumulation IEMs,"" in which the buildup of the molecule is toxic. Changes to DNA of a protein, such as PAH, are made in both copies of the gene that is altered, because one working copy of the gene allows the protein to function. PAH is mainly a liver protein. PKU is associated with high blood Phe levels and low Tyr levels. Newborns with PKU can look normal at birth with the first signs showing many months later. Signs of PKU can include a musty smell from skin and pee, fair skin, red and itchy skin, seizures, tremors, and an active and disruptive behavior.",,"PKU is an inborn error of metabolism (IEM) most often caused by missense mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) the circulating toxin is a amino acid or its metabolites.

44,25284231,"Uncontrolled bleeding is the leading cause of shock in trauma patients and delays in recognition and treatment have been linked to adverse outcomes. For prompt detection and management of hypovolaemic shock, ATLS(®) suggests four shock classes based upon vital signs and an estimated blood loss in percent. Although this classification has been widely implemented over the past decades, there is still no clear prospective evidence to fully support this classification. In contrast, it has recently been shown that this classification may be associated with substantial deficits. A retrospective analysis of data derived from the TraumaRegister DGU(®) indicated that only 9.3% of all trauma patients could be allocated into one of the ATLS(®) shock classes when a combination of the three vital signs heart rate, systolic blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Scale was assessed. Consequently, more than 90% of all trauma patients could not be classified according to the ATLS(®) classification of hypovolaemic shock. Further analyses including also data from the UK-based TARN registry suggested that ATLS(®) may overestimate the degree of tachycardia associated with hypotension and underestimate mental disability in the presence of hypovolaemic shock.

Hypothesis/Problem: The objective of this study was to describe the shock index (SI) in a healthy military population, and to measure its variation during a controlled blood loss, simulated by blood donation. Methods: A prospective observational study that enrolled military subjects, volunteers for blood donation, was conducted. Demographic and clinical information, concerning both the patient and the blood collection, were recorded. Baseline vital signs were measured, before and after donation, in a 45° supine position. Statistical analysis was performed after calculation of SI. Results: A total of 483 participants were included in the study. The mean blood donation volume was 473mL (SD = 44mL). The median pre- and post-blood donation SI were significantly different: 0.54 (IQR = 0.48-0.63) and 0.57 (IQR = 0.49-0.66), respectively (P = .002). Changes in pre-/post-donation blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) also reached statistical difference but represented a clinically poor relevance. The multivariate analysis showed no significant associations between SI variations and age, sex, body mass index (BMI), sport activities, blood donation volume, and enteral volume replacement (EVR). Conclusion: In this model of mild hemorrhage, SI exhibited significant variations but failed to reach clinical relevance.

34,31573641,"Importance: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 16th leading cause of years of life lost worldwide. Appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management by primary care clinicians are necessary to prevent adverse CKD-associated outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death. Observations: Defined as a persistent abnormality in kidney structure or function (eg, glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or albuminuria ≥30 mg per 24 hours) for more than 3 months, CKD affects 8% to 16% of the population worldwide. In developed countries, CKD is most commonly attributed to diabetes and hypertension. However, less than 5% of patients with early CKD report awareness of their disease. Among individuals diagnosed as having CKD, staging and new risk assessment tools that incorporate GFR and albuminuria can help guide treatment, monitoring, and referral strategies. Optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction (eg, statins and blood pressure management), treatment of albuminuria (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers), avoidance of potential nephrotoxins (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and adjustments to drug dosing (eg, many antibiotics and oral hypoglycemic agents). Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and anemia. Those at high risk of CKD progression (eg, estimated GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, albuminuria ≥300 mg per 24 hours, or rapid decline in estimated GFR) should be promptly referred to a nephrologist.

30,32935877,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) collection began in two Brazilian hospitals for treatment of severe/critical patients. Methods and materials: Mild/moderate COVID-19 convalescents were selected as CCP donors after reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and absence of symptoms for ≥14 days plus (a) age (18-60 years), body weight greater than 55 kg; (b) immunohematological studies; (c) no infectious markers of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, human T-lymphotropic virus-1/2, Chagas and syphilis infection; (d) no HLA antibodies (multiparous); (e) second RT-PCR (nasopharyngeal swab and/or blood) negativity; (f) virus neutralization test (cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test neutralizing antibody) and anti-nucleocapsid protein SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Among 271 donors (41 females, 230 males), 250 presented with neutralizing antibodies. Final RT-PCR was negative on swab (77.0%) or blood (88.4%; P = .46). Final definition of RT-PCR was only defined at more than 28 days after full recovery in 59 of 174 (33.9%) RT-PCR -ve, and 25/69 RT-PCR +ve (36.2%; 13 between 35 and 48 days). Neutralizing antibody titers of 160 or greater were found in 63.6%. Correlation between IgG signal/cutoff of 5.0 or greater and neutralizing antibody of 160 or greater was 82.4%. Combination of final RT-PCR -ve with neutralizing antibody ≥160 was 41.3% (112/271). Serial plasma collection showed decline in neutralizing antibody titers and IgA levels (P < .05), probably denoting a ""golden period"" for CCP collection (≤28 days after joining the program); IgA might have an important role as neutralizing antibody. Donor's weight, days between disease onset and serial plasma collection, and IgG and IgM levels are important predictors for neutralizing antibody titer. Conclusions: RT-PCR +ve cases are still detected in 36.2% within 28 to 48 days after recovery. High anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG levels may be used as a surrogate marker to neutralizing antibody.","Collection of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the viral, respiratory illness Covid-19, also called convalescent plasma, began in two hospitals in Brazil for treatment of severe patients. People recovering from mild or moderate Covid-19 infection are selected as donors for blood plasma if they have had no symptoms for at least 14 days. Additional tests are done for other infections such as hepatitis and HIV and for antibodies (or infection-fighting proteins) for Covid-19. Among 271 blood plasma donors, 250 have antibodies in the body to fight Covid-19. In 77% of donors, no genetic trace of Covid-19 is found from a swab test and in 88.4%, none is found in blood. At more than 28 days after full recovery, 59 out of 174 are negative (with no virus detected), and 25 out of 69 are positive (with virus detected), but 13 of these are between 35 and 48 days. Additional tests are done to learn more about the level of antibodies in the blood.  Blood plasma collection showed a decline in antibodies that attach to the virus and keep it from entering cells. The donor's weight, days between the start of the disease and repeated plasma collection, and antibody levels are important for predicting possible antibody concentration that can keep the virus from entering cells. In conclusion, a positive test that finds genetic traces of the virus are still detected in 36.2% of cases within 28 to 48 days after recovery. High levels of certain antibody proteins may be used to identify antibodies that can neutralize the virus and make it inactive.",,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) collection began in two Brazilian hospitals for treatment of severe/critical patients.

Further, vitamin D modulates multiple mechanisms of the immune system to contain the virus that includes dampening the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, reduces concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, enhances the production of natural antimicrobial peptide and activates defensive cells such as macrophages that could destroy SARS-CoV-2.","Vitamin D plays a key role in controlling blood pressure and fluid in the body and is used by SARS-CoV-2, the virus leading to the respiratory disease of COVID-19, for entry into cells. Vitamin D controls several processes of the immune system to minimize the virus. Examples include preventing entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus that can lead to COVID-19), reducing inflammation (the body's response to infection causing swelling, pain, or redness), and increasing the production of natural defensive cells in the body that could destroy SARS-CoV-2.",,"Vitamin D is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that is exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for entry into the host cells. vitamin D modulates multiple mechanisms of immune system to contain the virus that includes dampening the entry and replication of virus, reduces concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhances the production of natural antimicrobial peptide and activates defensive cells such as macrophages that could destroy virus-cov-2."
50,33657772,"We evaluated the impact of tumor shrinkage (TS) induced by molecular targeted therapy as the first-line systemic therapy on the survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). A total of 67 patients with mRCC who received first-line molecular targeted therapy were included in this study. Sixty patients were evaluable by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. Patients underwent the first evaluation at 8-12 weeks after the start of the therapy. Twenty patients had TS ≧30%, 32 from 30% to -20%, and 8 ≦-20%. The median overall survival periods of patients who achieved TS ≧30%, from 30% to -20%, and ≦-20% at first evaluation were 41.0, 35.0, and 11.5 months, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that TS of≧0%, in addition to negative C-reactive protein and the absence of bone metastasis were good predictors of overall survival. The patients who achieved 0% or more at the initial evaluation had longer survival than those who had no tumor reduction (40.0 months vs 12.0 months, p<0. 001). These findings suggest that early TS affects overall survival in real practice. We should consider alternative therapies for patients who have not achieved tumor reduction at the initial evaluation.","This study evaluated the impact of tumor shrinkage (TS) caused by molecular targeted therapy as the first-line systemic (full-body) therapy on the survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). mRCC is kidney cancer that has spread to other organs. Molecular targeted therapy is a treatment type that uses drugs to target specific molecules involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. A total of 67 patients with mRCC who received molecular targeted therapy were included in this study. Sixty patients were evaluated by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. Patients underwent the first evaluation at 8-12 weeks after the start of the therapy. Twenty patients had TS ≧ 30%, 32 from 30% to -20%, and 8 ≦ -20%. The median (average) overall survival periods of patients who achieved TS ≧30%, from 30% to -20%, and ≦-20% at first evaluation were 41.0, 35.0, and 11.5 months, respectively. Analyses showed that TS of ≧0%, partnered with negative C-reactive protein and the absence of bone metastasis (cancer spreading), were good predictors of overall survival. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). The patients who achieved 0% or more at the initial evaluation had longer survival times than those who had no tumor reduction. These findings suggest that early TS affects overall survival in real practice. Alternative therapies should be considered for patients who have not achieved tumor reduction at the initial evaluation.",,"67 patients with mRCC who received first-line molecular targeted therapy were included in this study.

26,33049331,"Objectives: To summarise the evidence on the duration of infectiousness of individuals in whom SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid is detected. Methods: A rapid review was undertaken in PubMed, Europe PubMed Central and EMBASE from 1 January 2020 to 26 August 2020. Results: We identified 15 relevant studies, including 13 virus culture studies and 2 contact tracing studies. For 5 virus culture studies, the last day on which SARS-CoV-2 was isolated occurred within 10 days of symptom onset. For another 5 studies, SARS-CoV-2 was isolated beyond day 10 for approximately 3% of included patients. The remaining 3 virus culture studies included patients with severe or critical disease; SARS-CoV-2 was isolated up to day 32 in one study. Two studies identified immunocompromised patients from whom SARS-CoV-2 was isolated for up to 20 days. Both contact tracing studies, when close contacts were first exposed greater than 5 days after symptom onset in the index case, found no evidence of laboratory-confirmed onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients with mild-to-moderate illness are highly unlikely to be infectious beyond 10 days of symptoms. However, evidence from a limited number of studies indicates that patients with severe-to-critical illness or who are immunocompromised, may shed infectious virus for longer.","The goal of this paper was to summarize scientific reports detailing the amount of time someone positive for (or with) COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) can infect others. To do this, the authors reviewed papers published in public databases (e.g. PubMed, Europe PubMed Central, EMBASE) between the dates of January 1, 2020 to August 26, 2020. Fifteen studies were identified for review. Thirteen reports focused on COVID-19 that was grown within a laboratory (in culture) from human biological sampling. Two studies followed contact tracing between humans. For 5 viral culture studies, the last day that COVID-19 was able to be identified in biological samples was 10 days before symptoms occurred. For another 5 culture studies, COVID-19 was identified in biological samples past day 10. The remaining 3 virus culture studies evaluated patients with severe or critical COVID-19 illness. COVID-19 was isolated up to 32 days in one of these studies. Two studies identified immunocompromised patients (patients with decreased immune function) from whom COIVD-19 was able to be isolated from for up to 20 days. For both contact tracing or spreading studies, when exposure occurred more than five days after symptoms were apparent, there was no evidence of COVID-19 spreading. The authors concluded that COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms are unlikely to spread the virus to others beyond 10 days of symptoms. However, studies have shown that patients with severe to critical symptoms, or those who are immunocompromised, may spread the virus for longer periods of time.",,"the last day on which SARS-CoV-2 was isolated occurred within 10 days of symptom onset for approximately 3% of included patients. two studies identified immunocompromised patients from whom sARS - Cov-2 is isolated for up to 20 days in one study. a limited number of studies indicates that patients with severe-to-critical illness may shed infectious virus for longer.
