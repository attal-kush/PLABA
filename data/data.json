First, by protecting cardiac output with greater elevations in heart rate associated with greater cardiac vagal withdrawal and sympathetically mediated adrenergic stimulation. Second, a greater increases in systemic peripheral vascular resistance (blood vessel resistance) associated with higher sympathetic nerve activation (fight-or-flight reaction) and levels of circulating vasopressor endocrine responses (responses from chemical messengers). Third, an alternating blood flow between the brain and peripheral tissue with greater sympathetically mediated oscillatory patterns of systemic pressure and flow.
