29,32837716,"This review focused on the use of plant based foods for enhancing the immunity of all aged groups against COVID-19. In humans, coronaviruses are included in the spectrum of viruses that cause the common cold and, recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS present a major threat to public health. The novel coronavirus has spread rapidly to multiple countries and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 is usually caused a virus to which most probably the people with low immunity response are being effected. Plant based foods increased the intestinal beneficial bacteria which are helpful and makes up of 85% of the immune system. By the use of plenty of water, minerals like magnesium and Zinc, micronutrients, herbs, food rich in vitamins C, D & E and better life style one can promote the health and can overcome this infection. Various studies investigated that a powerful antioxidant Glutathione and a bioflavonoid Quercetin may prevent various infections including COVID-19. In conclusion, the plant based foods play a vital role to enhance the immunity of people to control of COVID-19.","This review focuses on the use of plant based foods for increasing the immunity of all age groups against Covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related illness). In humans, coronaviruses, which cause COVID-19, are included in the type of viruses that cause the common cold and, recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which can cause fever, cough, and breathing problems. New infectious diseases, such as SARS, present a major threat to public health. The new coronavirus has quickly spread to many countries and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. People with a low or weakened immune response are probably most effected by Covid-19. Plant based foods increase the good bacteria in the stomach which are helpful and make up of 85% of the immune system. Drinking plenty of water, consuming minerals like magnesium and Zinc, vitamins, herbs, food with a lot of vitamins C, D & E, and a healthy life style can promote health and can fight this infection. Different research studies find that a powerful antioxidant (a vitamin or mineral that can repair cells) called Glutathione and a plant-based vitamin called Quercetin may prevent infections, including Covid-19. In conclusion, plant based foods play a key role in strengthening the immunity of people to control Covid-19.",
19,32651292,"Objective: We tested the hypothesis that there are 2 distinct phenotypes of Parkinson tremor, based on interindividual differences in the response of resting tremor to dopaminergic medication. We also investigated whether this pattern is specific to tremor by comparing interindividual differences in the dopamine response of tremor to that of bradykinesia. Methods: In this exploratory study, we performed a levodopa challenge in 76 tremulous patients with Parkinson tremor. Clinical scores (Movement Disorders Society-sponsored version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III) were collected ""off"" and ""on"" a standardized dopaminergic challenge (200/50 mg dispersible levodopa-benserazide). In both sessions, resting tremor intensity was quantified using accelerometry, both during rest and during cognitive coactivation. Bradykinesia was quantified using a speeded keyboard test. We calculated the distribution of dopamine-responsiveness for resting tremor and bradykinesia. In 41 patients, a double-blinded, placebo-controlled dopaminergic challenge was repeated after approximately 6 months. Results: The dopamine response of resting tremor, but not bradykinesia, significantly departed from a normal distribution. A cluster analysis on 3 clinical and electrophysiologic markers of tremor dopamine-responsiveness revealed 3 clusters: dopamine-responsive, intermediate, and dopamine-resistant tremor. A repeated levodopa challenge after 6 months confirmed this classification. Patients with dopamine-responsive tremor had greater disease severity and tended to have a higher prevalence of dyskinesia. Conclusion: Parkinson resting tremor can be divided into 3 partially overlapping phenotypes, based on the dopamine response. These tremor phenotypes may be associated with different underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, requiring a different therapeutic approach.","Researchers tested the idea that there are 2 distinct phenotypes (observable traits or characteristics) of Parkinson tremor based on differences among people in how the resting tremor (a tremor when the muscle is relaxed) responds to dopamine medication. Researchers also investigated whether this pattern is specific to tremor by comparing differences in the dopamine response of the tremor to that of bradykinesia (slowness of movement). In the study, we performed a levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine) challenge (when a drug is used to confirm a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease if the patient's symptoms improve while taking the medication) in 76 patients with Parkinson tremor. Clinical scores using a tool that evaluates the severity of Parkinson's disease are collected in stages of ""off"" (when symptoms return) and ""on"" (when patient feels energetic and can move) during a standard dopamine challenge. In both sessions, resting tremor intensity was measured using accelerometry (a device that records motion and non-motion) both during rest and while doing another mental task at the same time. Bradykinesia is measured using a speeded keyboard test. The distribution (the movement of a drug to and from the blood and different tissues of the body) of dopamine-responsiveness for resting tremor and bradykinesia is calculated. In 41 patients, a dopamine challenge is repeated after about 6 months. The dopamine response of resting tremor, but not bradykinesia, significantly departed from normal in the body. An analysis of brain activity revealed 3 clusters: dopamine-responsive, intermediate, and dopamine-resistant tremor. A repeated levodopa challenge after 6 months confirmed these clusters. Patients with dopamine-responsive tremor have greater disease severity and tend to have a higher amount of dyskinesia (involuntary and uncontrollable movements). In conclusion, Parkinson resting tremor can be divided into 3 partially overlapping characteristics based on dopamine response. These tremor characteristics may be connected with different underlying functional changes that come with Parkinson's disease, requiring a different treatment approach.","We tested if there are 2 different types of Parkinson tremors, or body shakes due to a brain-related disease affecting movement, based on individualized responses to medication altering levels of dopamine, a chemical messenger. We checked if these patterns are tremor-specific by comparing individualized responses of dopamine by tremors to those by bradykinesia (a slowing of movement). We tested responsiveness to levodopa (a Parkinson's medication) in 76 patients with Parkinson tremors, or shakes by a brain-related disease affecting movement.   In 41 patients, a dopamine-sensitivty test was repeated after around 6 months. The dopamine response of resting tremor, but not bradykinesia, was atypical. There were 3 types of tremor dopamine-responsiveness: dopamine-responsive, intermediate, and dopamine-resistant tremor. A levodopa sensitivity test 6 months later matched these tremor response categories. Patients with dopamine-responsive tremors had higher disease severity and frequency of impaired movement. Parkinson resting tremors has 3 physical trait types, based on dopamine response. These tremor patterns may be linked with unrevealed biological processes and need different treatments."
19,32830901,"Degradation of striatal dopamine in Parkinson's disease (PD) may initially be supplemented by increased cognitive control mediated by cholinergic mechanisms. Shift to cognitive control of walking can be quantified by prefrontal cortex activation. Levodopa improves certain aspects of gait and worsens others, and cholinergic augmentation influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity remains unclear. This study examined dopaminergic and cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity while walking in PD. A single-site, randomized, double-blind crossover trial examined effects of levodopa and donepezil in PD. Twenty PD participants were randomized, and 19 completed the trial. Participants were randomized to either levodopa + donepezil (5 mg) or levodopa + placebo treatments, with 2 weeks with treatment and a 2-week washout. The primary outcome was change in prefrontal cortex activity while walking, and secondary outcomes were change in gait and dual-task performance and attention. Levodopa decreased prefrontal cortex activity compared with off medication (effect size, -0.51), whereas the addition of donepezil reversed this decrease. Gait speed and stride length under single- and dual-task conditions improved with combined donepezil and levodopa compared with off medication (effect size, 1 for gait speed and 0.75 for stride length). Dual-task reaction time was quicker with levodopa compared with off medication (effect size, -0.87), and accuracy improved with combined donepezil and levodopa (effect size, 0.47). Cholinergic therapy, specifically donepezil 5 mg/day for 2 weeks, can alter prefrontal cortex activity when walking and improve secondary cognitive task accuracy and gait in PD. Further studies will investigate whether higher prefrontal cortex activity while walking is associated with gait changes.","Dopamine is a chemical messenger that carries signals between brain cells and affects mood, motivation, and movement. The breakdown and inactivation of dopamine in Parkinson's disease (PD) may initially be addressed by increased cognitive (thought-related) control brought about by cholinergic mechanisms (types of drugs that inhibit, enhance, or imitate the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, the primary signaling molecule of nerve cells). Shift to cognitive control of walking can be measured by prefrontal cortex activation (activating the part of the brain that controls behavior, such as decision-making). Levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) improves certain aspects of gait (how a person walks) and worsens others. Cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity remains unclear. This study examines dopaminergic (drugs that increase dopamine activity) and cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity while walking in PD. A clinical study examines the effects of levodopa and donepezil (a type of drug that helps mental function) in Parkinson's disease. In this study, 20 people with Parkinson's disease were randomly put in treatment groups, and 19 completed the study. Participants were randomly put in either the group that received both levodopa + donepezil or the group that received levodopa + placebo (sham) treatments, with 2 weeks spent on treatment and a 2-week washout (the study phase when the drug is stopped and no other drug is used). The main outcome (result) is change in prefrontal cortex activity while walking. Secondary outcomes are change in gait, dual-task performance (doing two tasks at the same time), and attention. Levodopa decreased prefrontal cortex activity (the part of the brain that controls behavior, such as decision-making) compared with off medication, whereas the addition of donepezil reversed this decrease. Gait speed and stride length while doing single- and dual-task conditions improved with combined donepezil and levodopa compared with off medication. Dual-task reaction time was quicker with levodopa compared with off medication, and accuracy improved with the combined donepezil and levodopa drugs. Cholinergic drugs, specifically donepezil for 2 weeks, can alter prefrontal cortex activity when walking and improve secondary cognitive task accuracy and gait in Parkinson's disease. Further studies will investigate whether higher prefrontal cortex activity while walking is associated with gait changes.",
19,33165964,"Background: No clinical trials have been specifically designed to compare medical treatments after surgery in Parkinson's disease (PD). Objective: Study's objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of levodopa versus dopamine agonist monotherapy after deep brain stimulation (DBS) in PD. Methods: Thirty-five surgical candidates were randomly assigned to receive postoperative monotherapy with either levodopa or dopamine agonist in a randomized, single-blind study. All patients were reevaluated in short- (3 months), mid- (6 months), and long-term (2.5 years) follow-up after surgery. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) 3 months after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were the percentage of patients maintaining monotherapy, change in motor symptoms, and specific non-motor symptoms (NMS). Analysis was performed primarily in the intention-to-treat population. Results: Randomization did not significantly affect the primary outcome (difference in NMSS between treatment groups was 4.88 [95% confidence interval: -11.78-21.53, P = 0.566]). In short- and mid-term follow-up, monotherapy was safe and feasible in more than half of patients (60% in short- and 51.5% in mid-term follow-up), but it was more often possible for patients on levodopa. The ability to maintain dopamine agonist monotherapy was related to optimal contact location. In the long term, levodopa monotherapy was feasible only in a minority of patients (34.2%), whereas dopamine agonist monotherapy was not tolerated due to worsening of motor conditions or occurrence of impulse control disorders. Conclusions: This trial provides evidence for simplifying pharmacological treatment after functional neurosurgery for PD. The reduction in dopamine receptor agonists should be attempted while monitoring for occurrence of NMSs, such as apathy and sleep disturbances.","No clinical trials with patients have been developed to compare medical treatments after surgery in Parkinson's disease (a brain disorder that affects movement and coordination). The objective of this study is to compare the performance and safety of levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) versus dopamine agonist (a drug that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body) single therapy after deep brain stimulation (surgery that implants devices to stimulate certain areas of the brain) in patients with Parkinson's disease. In this study, 35 patients who are planning to undergo surgery are randomly assigned to receive either levodopa or dopamine agonist after surgery. All patients are evaluated in short (3 months), mid (6 months), and long-term (2.5 years) follow-up appointments after the surgery. The key outcome (result) researchers planned to evaluate is the change in the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale, a scale to count and measure severity of non-motor (unrelated to movement) symptoms such as pain and tiredness, 3 months after surgery. A second outcome is the percent of patients staying on only one drug, change in motor (movement) symptoms, and specific non-motor symptoms. The analysis mainly focuses on the patients who were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment. Being randomly assigned into treatments did not significantly affect the key outcome from the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale between the two treatment groups. In the 3-month and 6-month follow-up appointments, single therapy (only one drug) is safe and practical in more than half of patients, but it was more often possible for patients on levodopa. The ability to maintain dopamine agonist as the only treatment drug is related to the best contact location. In the 2.5 year follow-up, levodopa single therapy is feasible only in a small number of patients, whereas dopamine agonist single therapy is not tolerated (unable to handle side effects) due to worsening of motor conditions or occurrence of impulse control disorders (disorders in which temptations or thoughts cannot be resisted). In conclusion, this study provides evidence for simplifying drug treatment after brain surgery for Parkinson's disease. The reduction in dopamine agonists should be attempted while monitoring for development of non-motor symptoms, such as lack of motivation and sleep disturbances.",
13,31509499,"The normal sleep-wake cycle is characterized by diurnal variations in blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac events. Sleep apnea disrupts the normal sleep-heart interaction, and the pathophysiology varies for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea (CSA). Associations exist between sleep-disordered breathing (which encompasses both OSA and CSA) and heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, coronary artery disease, and cardiovascular mortality. Treatment options include positive airway pressure as well as adaptive servo-ventilation and phrenic nerve stimulation for CSA. Treatment improves blood pressure, quality of life, and sleepiness, the last particularly in those at risk for cardiovascular disease. Results from clinical trials are not definitive in terms of hard cardiovascular outcomes.","The normal sleep-wake cycle has daily changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and heart-related events. Sleep apnea (a disorder in which breathing is regularly interrupted during sleep) alters the sleep-heart interaction. The disease-related physical effects vary for obstructive and central sleep apnea, sleep apnea by throat blockage and brain dysfunction, respectively. Links exist between sleep-disordered breathing, which includes both types of sleep apnea, heart failure, irregular heart beats, stroke (brain damage from reduced brain blood supply), coronary artery disease, which is plaque buildup blocking blood flow, and cardiovascular death. Machine-based treatments include positive airway pressure and adaptive servo-ventillation, which both involve pumping air into the lungs, and phrenic nerve stimulation, which involves contracting the diaphragm to breathe, for central sleep apnea (sleep apnea by brain dysfunction). Treatment improves blood pressure, quality of life, and sleepiness, the last especially in those at risk for heart- and blood-related disease. Heart-related results from clinical trials are not definitive.","The normal sleep-wake cycle (our-24 hour daily sleep pattern) is characterized by fluctuations in the day and variations at night in blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac events (reduced blood flow that may damage the heart). Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts. Sleep apnea disrupts the normal patterns between sleep and how the heart functions, and the physical changes vary for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), caused by airflow blockage, and central sleep apnea (CSA), when breathing regularly stops while sleeping because the brain doesn't tell the muscles to take in air. There are associations between sleep-disordered breathing, including OSA and CSA, and heart failure, atrial fibrillation (a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots) and other heart problems. Treatment options include positive airway pressure (a machine used to pump air under pressure into the airway of the lungs), adaptive servo-ventilation (a device that tracks and adjusts its pressure to match the breathing pattern of a person with sleep apnea), and phrenic nerve stimulation (treatment that sends electrical stimulation to the patient's phrenic nerve to contract the diaphragm and produce breathing). Treatment improves blood pressure, quality of life, and sleepiness. Results from clinical trials are not definite in how they affected common cardiovascular diseases."

A multidisciplinary team of surgeons, phoniatrists, and speech-language therapists is necessary to develop the appropriate treatment strategy. A thorough medical history, clinical investigation of the swallowing muscles, and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with foods of different consistencies help to decide whether swallowing exercises alone are sufficient, or whether an additional pharmacologic or surgical treatment is needed to prevent aspiration, malnutrition, and dehydration.","Most swallowing problems can be fixed, although the treatment depends on the type of trouble swallowing. A team of surgeons, doctors who treat organs involved in speech production, and people who treat communication and swallowing disorders is needed to figure out the best treatment. Information provided by the patient, examination of the swallowing muscles, and using a flexible tube with a camera to see swallowing of different foods help decide whether swallowing exercises are enough, or whether drugs or surgery are also needed to prevent something entering the airway or lungs by accident, prevent a lack of nutrients in the body, and prevent a lack of fluid in the body.","Most swallowing problems can be treated, but the treatment depends on the type of swallowing difficulty. A multi-type team of surgeons, speech-related organ specialists, and speech-language therapists is needed to create appropriate treatment.

29,32911778,"The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus has caused shock waves in many countries, producing a global health crisis worldwide. Lack of knowledge of the biological mechanisms of viruses, plus the absence of effective treatments against the disease (COVID-19) and/or vaccines have pulled factors that can compromise the proper functioning of the immune system to fight against infectious diseases into the spotlight. The optimal status of specific nutrients is considered crucial to keeping immune components within their normal activity, helping to avoid and overcome infections. Specifically, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated and deems six vitamins (D, A, C, Folate, B6, B12) and four minerals (zinc, iron, copper and selenium) to be essential for the normal functioning of the immune system, due to the scientific evidence collected so far. In this report, an update on the evidence of the contribution of nutritional factors as immune-enhancing aspects, factors that could reduce their bioavailability, and the role of the optimal status of these nutrients within the COVID-19 pandemic context was carried out. First, a non-systematic review of the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of an optimal nutritional status of these nutrients on the proper functioning of the immune system as well as their potential role in COVID-19 prevention/treatment was carried out by searching for available scientific evidence in PubMed and LitCovid databases. Second, a compilation from published sources and an analysis of nutritional data from 10 European countries was performed, and the relationship between country nutritional status and epidemiological COVID-19 data (available in the Worldometers database) was evaluated following an ecological study design. Furthermore, the potential effect of genetics was considered through the selection of genetic variants previously identified in Genome-Wide Association studies (GWAs) as influencing the nutritional status of these 10 considered nutrients. Therefore, access to genetic information in accessible databases (1000genomes, by Ensembl) of individuals from European populations enabled an approximation that countries might present a greater risk of suboptimal status of the nutrients studied. Results from the review approach show the importance of maintaining a correct nutritional status of these 10 nutrients analyzed for the health of the immune system, highlighting the importance of Vitamin D and iron in the context of COVID-19. Besides, the ecological study demonstrates that intake levels of relevant micronutrients-especially Vitamins D, C, B12, and iron-are inversely associated with higher COVID-19 incidence and/or mortality, particularly in populations genetically predisposed to show lower micronutrient status. In conclusion, nutrigenetic data provided by joint assessment of 10 essential nutrients for the functioning of the immune system and of the genetic factors that can limit their bioavailability can be a fundamental tool to help strengthen the immune system of individuals and prepare populations to fight against infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (which causes COVID-19 - a viral, breathing-related illness) has caused shock waves in many countries, producing a global health crisis. Lack of knowledge of how the virus works, plus the absence of effective treatments against Covid-19 and/or vaccines have put the immune system and its ability to fight disease in the spotlight. Having a healthy balance of specific nutrients is key to keeping parts of the immune system working in order to avoid and fight infections. There are 6 vitamins (D, A, C, Folate, B6, B12) and 4 minerals (zinc, iron, copper and selenium) that the European Food Safety Authority sees as important for the immune system to function well. In this report is an update on the evidence of 1) how nutrition impacts the immune system, 2) what things might reduce how long nutrients stay in the body, and 3) the role of the healthy balance of these nutrients during the Covid-19 pandemic. First, researchers review available scientific data on the impact of a healthy balance of these nutrients on the immune system, as well as their role in Covid-19 prevention and treatment. Second, nutrition data from 10 European countries are compiled and analyzed, and the relationship between country nutrition and Covid-19 data is evaluated. Additionally, the possible effect of genes on nutrient balance is considered for these 10 nutrients. Using genetic information from available databases, researchers estimated that countries may be at a greater risk of low nutritional balance. Results from the review show the importance of keeping a correct nutritional balance of these 10 nutrients for the health of the immune system and highlights the importance of Vitamin D and iron in the context of Covid-19. The study of these nutrients and their environment shows that the amount consumed of certain vitamins and minerals-especially Vitamins D, C, B12, and iron-are inversely or oppositely associated with higher Covid-19 numbers and/or death (i.e., the higher the nutrition, the lower the risk of Covid-19 illness and vice versa). This finding is very important for groups with genes shown to lower micronutrient status. In conclusion, using nutritional and genetic data and how they influence the immune system and how long nutrients stay in the body can be key tools to help strengthen the immune system of individuals and prepare people to fight viruses such as Covid-19.",
34,34249961,"Due to the unique role of the kidney in the metabolism of nutrients, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) lose the ability to excrete solutes and maintain homeostasis. Nutrient intake modifications and monitoring of nutritional status in this population becomes critical, since it can affect important health outcomes, including progression to kidney failure, quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. Although there are multiple hemodynamic and metabolic factors involved in the progression and prognosis of CKD, nutritional interventions are a central component of the care of patients with non-dialysis CKD (ND-CKD) and of the prevention of overweight and possible protein energy-wasting. Here, we review the reno-protective effects of diet in adults with ND-CKD stages 3-5, including transplant patients.","Due to the unique role of the kidney in turning nutrients into fuel, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) lose the ability to release dissolved substances and to maintain a healthy internal balance of water, sodium, and other elements in the body. Changing the nutrients that are consumed and checking for how nutrients impact health in this population is important, since it can impact health results, including advancing to kidney failure, quality of life, illness, and death. Although there are other factors involved in the progression and the likely course of chronic kidney disease, nutritional steps are a main part of the care of patients with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis, a process of filtering the blood of a person whose kidneys are not working normally by using a machine. This review discusses how diet in adults with chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 who are not on dialysis can have a protective effect on kidneys, including transplant patients.",
25,33080005,"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is threatening billions of people worldwide. Tocilizumab has shown promising results in retrospective studies in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with a good safety profile. Objective: To evaluate the effect of early tocilizumab administration vs standard therapy in preventing clinical worsening in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Design, setting, and participants: Prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial that randomized patients hospitalized between March 31 and June 11, 2020, with COVID-19 pneumonia to receive tocilizumab or standard of care in 24 hospitals in Italy. Cases of COVID-19 were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction method with nasopharyngeal swab. Eligibility criteria included COVID-19 pneumonia documented by radiologic imaging, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (Pao2/Fio2) ratio between 200 and 300 mm Hg, and an inflammatory phenotype defined by fever and elevated C-reactive protein. Interventions: Patients in the experimental arm received intravenous tocilizumab within 8 hours from randomization (8 mg/kg up to a maximum of 800 mg), followed by a second dose after 12 hours. Patients in the control arm received supportive care following the protocols of each clinical center until clinical worsening and then could receive tocilizumab as a rescue therapy. Main outcome and measures: The primary composite outcome was defined as entry into the intensive care unit with invasive mechanical ventilation, death from all causes, or clinical aggravation documented by the finding of a Pao2/Fio2 ratio less than 150 mm Hg, whichever came first. Results: A total of 126 patients were randomized (60 to the tocilizumab group; 66 to the control group). The median (interquartile range) age was 60.0 (53.0-72.0) years, and the majority of patients were male (77 of 126, 61.1%). Three patients withdrew from the study, leaving 123 patients available for the intention-to-treat analyses. Seventeen patients of 60 (28.3%) in the tocilizumab arm and 17 of 63 (27.0%) in the standard care group showed clinical worsening within 14 days since randomization (rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.59-1.86). Two patients in the experimental group and 1 in the control group died before 30 days from randomization, and 6 and 5 patients were intubated in the 2 groups, respectively. The trial was prematurely interrupted after an interim analysis for futility. Conclusions and relevance: In this randomized clinical trial of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and Pao2/Fio2 ratio between 200 and 300 mm Hg who received tocilizumab, no benefit on disease progression was observed compared with standard care. Further blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the results and to evaluate possible applications of tocilizumab in different stages of the disease.","The COVID-19 pandemic is threatening billions of people worldwide. COVID-19 is a viral, breathing-related disease. Tocilizumab, a type of drug called monoclonal antibodies, has shown promising results in recent studies in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia or lung infections. Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of giving tocilizumab early, compared to the standard treatment, to prevent a hospitalized COVID-19 patient with pneumonia from getting worse. Patients who are in the hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia are randomly put in groups to receive either tocilizumab or the standard care. Cases of COVID-19 are confirmed by taking a swab from inside the back of the nose. To be included in the study, patients must have COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by an x-ray, certain oxygen levels, a fever, and an increase in C-reactive proteins which are created in the liver in response to inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection). Patients in the experimental group receive tocilizumab through an IV (medicine is delivered in a vein in the arm) within 8 hours of being randomly placed in the group. A second dose is given after 12 hours. Patients in the comparison group receive support care based on hospital standards until the patient's condition worsens, and then they receive tocilizumab. The main study observations of interest are 1) going into intensive care units with machines to help breathe, 2) death from all causes, or 3) a worsening of a condition measured by oxygen levels. A total of 126 patients are randomly put into the experimental group to receive tocilizumab (60 patients) or in the comparison group (66 patients). The average age is 60 years, and most patients (61.1%) are male. Three patients dropped out of the study, leaving 123 patients in the study. Within 14 days since they were randomly put into groups, 17 out of 60 patients in the tocilizumab (experimental) group and 17 out of 63 patients in the standard (comparison) group have worsening conditions. Two patients in the experimental group and 1 in the comparison group died before 30 days after being randomly assigned into groups. Six patients in the experimental group and 5 patients of the other group were intubated (a tube is inserted through the nose or throat to help a person breathe). The trial was stopped early after an analysis showed that the experimental group is not likely to show any added benefit than the comparison group. This clinical study of adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed no benefit on lessening of the disease in patients receiving tocilizumab when compared to the standard care. Additional clinical studies are needed to confirm these results and to evaluate tocilizumab when given at different stages of the disease.",
25,34541573,"The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants has posed a serious global public health emergency. Therapeutic interventions or vaccines are urgently needed to treat and prevent the further dissemination of this contagious virus. This study described the identification of neutralizing receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies from mice through vaccination with a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD. RBD-targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with distinct function and epitope recognition were selected to understand SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. High-affinity RBD-specific antibodies exhibited high potency in neutralizing both live and pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 viruses and the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particle containing the spike protein S-RBDV367F mutant (SARS-CoV-2(V367F)). These results demonstrated that these antibodies recognize four distinct groups (I-IV) of epitopes on the RBD and that mAbs targeting group I epitope can be used in combination with mAbs recognizing groups II and/or IV epitope to make mAb cocktails against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants. Moreover, structural characterization reveals that groups I, III, and IV epitopes are closely located to an RBD hotspot. The identification of RBD-specific antibodies and cocktails may provide an effective therapeutic and prophylactic intervention against SARS-CoV-2 and its isolates.","The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus (the virus that causes COVID-19 or the breathing-related infection) and its variants has created a global public health emergency. Medical drugs and vaccines are needed to treat and prevent the spread of this contagious virus. This study describes how antibodies that are linked to receptor-binding domains (parts of the cell that connect the virus and allow entry to the cell) are identified in mice using a vaccine that includes a small piece of DNA or genetic material to teach the body to fight the infection. Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. Certain monoclonal antibodies are selected for the study to understand how the coronavirus can be made ineffective. Some antibodies with these receptor-binding domains have a high ability to make the coronavirus ineffective. These results show that monoclonal antibodies targeting certain parts of the virus can be used in combination with other monoclonal antibodies medicines against the coronavirus. The identification of these antibodies linked to receptor-binding domains and the mix of medicines may provide effective treatment and prevention against coronavirus.",
29,32340216,"Public health practices including handwashing and vaccinations help reduce the spread and impact of infections. Nevertheless, the global burden of infection is high, and additional measures are necessary. Acute respiratory tract infections, for example, were responsible for approximately 2.38 million deaths worldwide in 2016. The role nutrition plays in supporting the immune system is well-established. A wealth of mechanistic and clinical data show that vitamins, including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and folate; trace elements, including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper; and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid play important and complementary roles in supporting the immune system. Inadequate intake and status of these nutrients are widespread, leading to a decrease in resistance to infections and as a consequence an increase in disease burden. Against this background the following conclusions are made: (1) supplementation with the above micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids is a safe, effective, and low-cost strategy to help support optimal immune function; (2) supplementation above the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), but within recommended upper safety limits, for specific nutrients such as vitamins C and D is warranted; and (3) public health officials are encouraged to include nutritional strategies in their recommendations to improve public health.","Public health practices, including handwashing and vaccinations, help reduce the spread and impact of infections. However, the global impact of infection is high, and additional measures are necessary. Sudden infections in the lung, also called acute respiratory tract or breathing-related infections, for example, were responsible for about 2.38 million deaths worldwide in 2016. The role nutrition plays in supporting the immune or infection-fighting system is well-documented. A lot of data from existing studies show that vitamins and natural acids play important roles in supporting the immune system. These include vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and folate; trace elements, including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper; and the omega-3 fatty acids and other acids. Not eating or maintaining enough of these nutrients is common, leading to a decrease in the body's ability to resist infections which may result in higher illness, loss, and death because of disease. Based on this available information, the following conclusions are made: 1) using supplements to add vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids is a safe, effective, and inexpensive way to help support immune system functions; 2) supplements above the recommended amount, but still within safety limits, for certain nutrients may be allowed; and 3) public health officials are encouraged to include nutrition plans in their recommendations to improve public health.",
14,32935536,"The coronavirus are a wide group of viruses among that the SARS-CoV-2 is included (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Betacoronavirus and subgenus Sarbecovirus). Its main structural proteins are the membrane (M), the envelope (E), the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 involves the cellular and the humoral sides, with neutralizing antibodies fundamentally directed against the S antigen. Although the seroprevalence data are frequently assumed as protection markers, no necessarily they are. In Spain, it is estimated that, to assure the herd immunity, at least four-fifths of the population should be immunoprotected. Due the high fatality rate of COVID-19, the acquisition of the protection only by the natural infection it not assumable and other measures as the mass immunization are required. Currently, there are several vaccine prototypes (including life virus, viral vectors, peptides and proteins and nucleic acid) in different phase of clinical evaluation. Foreseeably, some of these news vaccines would be soon commercially available. In this text, aspects related to these issues are reviewed.","The coronavirus are a wide group of viruses among that the SARS-CoV-2 (the novel breathing-related coronavirus that can lead to COVID-19) is included. Its main structural proteins are the membrane (M) (a thin layer of lipids that protects the cell and acts as a barrier), the envelope (E) (a small membrane protein and is involved in parts of a virus life cycle), the nucleocapsid (N) (an important protein for viral replication and genome packaging) and spike (S) (a protein involved in introducing coronavirus into host cells). The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 involves the cellular (white blood cells that defend the body against infection) and the humoral sides (molecules that create antibodies against a specific antigen and involve substances found in the humors, or body fluids). There are some data of the percentage of people in a population who have antibodies to an infectious virus. These data are sometimes used to find out how well people are protected from a virus. In Spain, it is suggested that to reach herd immunity (a form of indirect protection from an infectious disease that can occur when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection), at least four-fifths of a population (about 80%) should have immunity. Due to the high death rate of COVID-19, being protected by getting the virus is not always reliable, and other measures to reach mass immunization are required. There are different vaccine types currently being evaluated. It is expected that these new vaccines will soon be available to the public.

50,21561990,"Fever after cardiac surgery in children may be due to bacterial infection or noninfectious origin like systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) secondary to bypass procedure. A marker to distinguish bacterial from nonbacterial fever in these conditions is clinically important. The purpose of our study was to evaluate, in the early postcardiac surgery period, whether serial measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) and its change over time (CRP velocity) can assist in detecting bacterial infection. A series of consecutive children who underwent cardiac surgery with bypass were tested for serum levels of CRP at several points up to 5 days postoperatively and during febrile episodes (>38.0°C). Findings were compared among febrile patients with proven bacterial infection (FWI group; sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, deep wound infection), febrile patients without bacterial infection (FNI group), and patients without fever (NF group). In all, 121 children were enrolled in the study, 31 in the FWI group, 42 in the FNI group, and 48 patients in the NF group. Ages ranged from 4 days to 17.8 years (median 19.0, mean 46 ± 56 months). There was no significant difference among the groups in mean CRP level before surgery, 1 hour, and 18 hours after. A highly significant interaction was found in the change in CRP over time by FWI group compared with FNI group (P < .001). Mean CRP velocity ([fCRP - 18hCRP]/[fever time (days) - 0.75 day]) was significantly higher in the infectious group (4.0 ± 4.2 mg/dL per d) than in the fever-only group (0.60 ± 1.6 mg/dL per d; P < .001). A CRP velocity of 4 mg/dL per d had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 85.7% for bacterial infection with 95.2% specificity. Serial measurements of CRP/CRP velocity after cardiac surgery in children may assist clinicians in differentiating postoperative fever due to bacterial infection from fever due to noninfectious origin.","Fever after heart surgery in children may be due to bacterial infection. The fever may also be caused by a noninfectious origin like systemic (full-body) inflammatory (infection-fighting) response syndrome (SIRS). A marker to distinguish bacterial from nonbacterial fever in these conditions is important. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in the period after heart surgery, whether measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) and its change over time (CRP velocity) can help detect bacterial infection. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). Children who underwent heart surgery with bypass (diverted blood flow) were tested for serum (blood) levels of CRP at several points up to 5 days after surgery and/or when they had a fever. Evidence was compared among three patient groups. The groups include: patients with fever with proven bacterial infection (FWI group), febrile (near-fever) patients without bacterial infection (FNI group), and patients without fever (NF group). In all, 121 children were enrolled in the study, 31 in the FWI group, 42 in the FNI group, and 48 patients in the NF group. Ages ranged from 4 days to 17.8 years. There was no significant difference among the groups in mean CRP level before surgery, 1 hour, and 18 hours after. A highly significant interaction was found in the change in CRP over time by the FWI group compared with the FNI group. Mean CRP velocity was significantly higher in the infectious group than in the fever-only group. Specific CRP velocity could positively predict bacterial infection with 95.2% specificity (accuracy). Serial (consistent) measurements of CRP/CRP velocity after heart surgery in children may assist clinicians in differentiating (identifying) post-operation fever due to bacterial infection from fever due to noninfectious origin.",
18,1770194,"The extent to which given levels of caloric restriction will improve glycemic status but increase plasma ketone bodies in gestational diabetic women has received little attention. After reviewing the underlying physiology, we present data on two feeding studies investigating the question. In the first, a weight-maintaining approximately 2400-kcal/day diet was fed on a metabolic ward to 12 gestational diabetic women for 1 week. In the second week, subjects were randomized to a continuation of the 2400-kcal/day diet or to a 1200-kcal/day diet. Twenty-four-hour mean glucose levels remained unchanged in the control group but declined in the calorie-restricted group (6.7 mM or 121 mg/dl in week 1 vs 5.4 mM or 97.3 mg/dl in week 2) (p less than 0.01). Nine-hour overnight fasting plasma insulin also declined but oral glucose tolerance did not improve with caloric restriction. Fasting plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate rose in the calorie-restricted group, along with an increase in ketonuria, but not in the control group. A second study compared the impact of a 33% calorie-restricted diet or insulin to a full-calorie diet in a similar 2-week experimental design and measured hepatic glucose output and insulin sensitivity with dideuterated glucose before and during an insulin clamp. Diet in three subjects improved fasting and 24-hr mean glucose by 22 and 10%, respectively, whereas prophylactic insulin in three subjects produced 0 and 4% reductions, respectively. On average, ketonuria after a 9-hr fast declined to an equivalent degree with both treatments. Hepatic glucose output and insulin sensitivity were not statistically significantly altered by gestational diabetes or the therapeutic interventions compared to nondiabetic normal weight or obese pregnant controls. In conclusion, 50% caloric restriction improves glycemic status in obese women with gestational diabetes but is associated with an increase in ketonuria, which is of uncertain significance. An intermediate 33% level of caloric restriction (to 1600-1800 kcal daily) may be more appropriate in dietary management of obese woman with gestational diabetes mellitus and more effective than prophylactic insulin. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.","How much caloric restriction (reducing the amount of calories consumed) will improve glycemic status (blood sugar levels) but increase ketone bodies (substances that the body makes if the cells don't get enough blood sugar) in gestational diabetic women (women diagnosed with diabetes for the first time during pregnancy) has received little attention. Data are presented on two studies that monitor and control diets to investigate these questions. In the first study, a diet of 2,400 calories per day is provided to 12 gestational diabetic women for 1 week. In the second week, patients were randomly assigned to either continue the 2,400 calories per day diet or to a 1,200 calories per day diet. The average glucose (blood sugar) levels remained unchanged in the 2,400 calorie diet group but declined in the lower calorie group that had a 1,200 calories per day diet. After fasting (no food) for 9 hours overnight, insulin (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood) also declined, but oral glucose tolerance (a test that measures how the body moves sugar from blood to the tissues) did not improve with the reduced calories diet. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (a chemical in the body that provides energy when not enough carbohydrates or sugars have been eaten) increased in the reduced calorie group, along with an increase in ketonuria, high amounts of ketones (substances that your body makes if your cells don't get enough blood sugar) in the urine, but not in the comparison group that had the 2,400 calorie diet. A second study compared the impact of a calorie-restricted diet reduced by 33% or insulin to a full-calorie diet in a similar 2 week experiment. The study measured liver production of sugar and insulin sensitivity with labeled glucose before and during an insulin clamp (used to maintain glucose levels). Diet in 3 patients improved fasting and average glucose levels. Prophylactic insulin (insulin administered to the patient) in 3 people also produced smaller reductions. On average, ketonuria after a 9 hour fast declined in the same amount with both treatments. Liver glucose production and insulin sensitivity were not significantly changed by gestational diabetes or the treatments compared to normal weight or obese pregnant women who did not have diabetes. In conclusion, reducing calories by half improves blood sugar levels in obese women with gestational diabetes but is connected with an increase in high amounts of ketones in the urine, which is of uncertain significance. Reducing calories by 33% (to 1,600 - 1,800 calories daily) may be better in diet management of obese women with gestational diabetes mellitus and more effective than prophylactic insulin. More studies are required to confirm these results.",

Methods: A prospective observational study that enrolled military subjects, volunteers for blood donation, was conducted. Demographic and clinical information, concerning both the patient and the blood collection, were recorded. Baseline vital signs were measured, before and after donation, in a 45° supine position. Statistical analysis was performed after calculation of SI. Results: A total of 483 participants were included in the study. The mean blood donation volume was 473mL (SD = 44mL). The median pre- and post-blood donation SI were significantly different: 0.54 (IQR = 0.48-0.63) and 0.57 (IQR = 0.49-0.66), respectively (P = .002). Changes in pre-/post-donation blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) also reached statistical difference but represented a clinically poor relevance. The multivariate analysis showed no significant associations between SI variations and age, sex, body mass index (BMI), sport activities, blood donation volume, and enteral volume replacement (EVR).

51,1541379,"Basal insulin secretion was compared in nine islet-cell antibody positive, non-diabetic first-degree relatives of children with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and nine normal control subjects matched for age, sex and weight. Acute insulin responses to a 25 g intravenous glucose tolerance test were similar in the two groups (243 (198-229) vs 329 (285-380) mU.l-1 x 10 min-1, mean (+/- SE), p = 0.25). Fasting plasma insulin was assayed in venous samples taken at one min intervals for 2 h. Time series analysis was used to demonstrate oscillatory patterns in plasma insulin. Autocorrelation showed that regular oscillatory activity was generally absent in the islet-cell antibody-positive group, whereas a regular 13 min cycle was shown in control subjects (p less than 0.0001). Fourier transformation did, however, show a 13 min spectral peak in the islet-cell antibody positive group, consistent with intermittent pulsatility. We conclude that overall oscillatory patterns of basal insulin secretion are altered in islet-cell antibody positive subjects even when the acute insulin response is within the normal range.","We compared background insulin release in nine islet-cell antibody (protein made against insulin-producing cells) positive, non-diabetic parents or siblings of children with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes and nine normal people matched for age, sex and weight.

We measured blood insulin in people who had not had anything to eat for a period of time in blood samples taken every minute for 2 hours. We looked at blood insulin over time to see how it rises and falls. The islet-cell antibody-positive group (group with the antibody) did not have a regular pattern, but normal people had a 13-minute cycle. The islet-cell antibody-positive group did have a peak every 13 minutes.

Changes in metabolism are crucial to fuel NK cell responses, and altered metabolism is linked to NK cell dysfunction in obesity and cancer. However, very little is known about the metabolic requirements of NK cells during acute retroviral infection and their importance for antiviral immunity. Here, using the Friend retrovirus mouse model, we show that following infection NK cells increase nutrient uptake, including amino acids and iron, and reprogram their metabolic machinery by increasing glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism. Specific deletion of the amino acid transporter Slc7a5 has only discrete effects on NK cells, but iron deficiency profoundly impaires NK cell antiviral functions, leading to increased viral loads. Our study thus shows the requirement of nutrients and metabolism for the antiviral activity of NK cells, and has important implications for viral infections associated with altered iron levels such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2.","Natural killer (NK) cells (white blood cells that kill cells infected with a virus) are important early responders against viral infections.

However, very little is known about the metabolism requirements of NK cells during short-term or acute retroviral infection (the earliest stage of infection). Using an animal model for study, researchers show that after infection, NK cells increase uptake of nutrients and reprogram how cells in metabolism work.

35,28285070,"Background: Clinical practice guidelines recommend use of fracture risk scores for screening and pharmacologic treatment decisions. The timing of occurrence of treatment-level (according to 2014 National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines) or screening-level (according to 2011 US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines) fracture risk scores has not been estimated in postmenopausal women. Methods: We conducted a retrospective competing risk analysis of new occurrence of treatment-level and screening-level fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women aged 50 years and older, prior to receipt of pharmacologic treatment and prior to first hip or clinical vertebral fracture. Results: In 54,280 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years without a bone mineral density test, the time for 10% to develop a treatment-level FRAX score could not be estimated accurately because of rare incidence of treatment-level scores. In 6096 women who had FRAX scores calculated with bone mineral density, the estimated unadjusted time to treatment-level FRAX ranged from 7.6 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.6-8.7) for those aged 65 to 69, to 5.1 years (95% CI, 3.5-7.5) for those aged 75 to 79 at baseline. Of 17,967 women aged 50 to 64 with a screening-level FRAX at baseline, 100 (0.6%) experienced a hip or clinical vertebral fracture by age 65 years. Conclusions: Postmenopausal women with sub-threshold fracture risk scores at baseline were unlikely to develop a treatment-level FRAX score between ages 50 and 64 years. After age 65, the increased incidence of treatment-level fracture risk scores, osteoporosis, and major osteoporotic fracture supports more frequent consideration of FRAX and bone mineral density testing.","Healtchare guidelines recommend using fracture risk scores for screening and drug treatment decisions. The timing of occurence of treatment-level (according to 2014 guidelines by an expert goup) or screening-level (according to 2011 guidelines by national experts) fracture risk scores has not been estimated in postmenopausal women who finished their last menstrual cycle.

In 54, 280 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years without a bone hardness test, the time for 10% to get a treatment-level fracture risk score could not be estimated correctly due to rare amount of treatment-level scores. In 6096 women who had fracture risk scores calculated with bone hardness, the estimated unadjusted time to treatment-level fracture risk ranged from 7.6 years for those aged 65 to 69, to 5.1 years, for those aged 75 to 79 at the start. Of 17,967 women aged 50 to 64 with a screening-level fracture risk score at the start, 100 (0.6%) had a hip or back fracture by age 65 years. Postmenopausal women with sub-threshold fracture risk scores at the start were unlikely to get a treatment-level fracture risk score between 50 and 64 years. After age 65, the increased amount of treatment-level fracture risk scores, bone weakening, and major fractures from bone weakening support more frequent consideration of fracture risk and bone hardness testing.","Guidelines for patient care recommend use of fracture risk scores, or the likelihood of having a major bone break, for checks and drug treatment decisions. The timing of treatment-level or screening-level fracture risk scores based on guidelines has not been estimated in women who have gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period). We measured new occurences of teratment-level and testing-level fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women aged 50 years and older, before receiving drug treatment and the first hip or clinical vertebral fracture. In 54,280 women who had gone through menopause aged 50 to 64 years without a bone mineral density test, we could not estimate the time for 10% to need treatment based on a common osteoporosis questionnaire due to too few scores suggesting treatment. In 6096 women who had scores from a common osteoporosis questionnaire, the estimated time to need treatment was 7.6 years and 5.1 years for those aged 65 to 69 and aged 75 to 79, respectively.

Areas covered: Chronic GAS pharyngeal carriage is quite common affecting 10-20% of school-aged children. Pathogenesis of carriage has been related to the pharynx microflora and to special properties of GAS, but several aspects are yet to be elucidated. Management greatly depends on whether the individual child belongs to a 'high-risk' group and might benefit from eradication regimens or not, when observation-only and reassurance are enough. Penicillin plus rifampin and clindamycin monotherapy have been recommended for eradication; limited evidence of effectiveness of azithromycin has been reported. Surgical intervention is not indicated. Expert commentary: GAS infection is a common reason for antibiotic use and abuse in children and asymptomatic carriers constitute the major reservoir of GAS in the community.

In this study, we review the science on treating long-term GAS in children and suggest a way to treat it using computers. Long-term GAS in the throat is found in 10-20% of school-aged children. Whether or not GAS in the throat causes infection depends on small organisms in the throat and special qualities of GAS, but many things are not clear. Treating long-term GAS depends on whether the child is high-risk and might benefit from killing the bacteria or not, when a doctor looking at it and removing fears and concerns about the illness are enough. Combining antibiotics penicillin with rifampin and clindamycin in one drug has been recommended to kill GAS. There is not much proof that the antibiotic azithromycin works. Surgery is not recommended.

25,34555986,"Introduction: Treatments for subjects with Covid-19 are required. One approach is neutralising monoclonal antibodies. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Areas covered: This evaluation is of the phase 3 BLAZE-1 clinical trial, which was of bamlanivimab plus etesevimab in adult ambulatory participants with a risk factor for, and mild to moderate, Covid-19 illness. The primary outcome was Covid 19 related hospitalisation of ≥ 24 hours or death from any cause by day 29, and this occurred in 2.1% subjects in the bamlanivimab/etesevimab group, compared to 7.0% in the placebo group. Expert opinion: In the pandemic, the attempts by the FDA to shorten approval processes for medicines and by journals to make information available in a timely manner are admirable. However, these shortened processes made negotiating the details of BLAZE-1 and producing accurate and critical appraisals difficult. It seems to me, that if there are any benefits of bamlanivimab alone in Covid-19, they are not clear-cut. Bamlanivimab has limited effects against the beta and gamma variants and is not effective against the delta variant. Thus, the benefits of bamlanivimab/etesevimab in the phase 3 of the BLAZE-1 may be solely due to etesevimab, and this needs to be tested.","Treatments for people with COVID-19, a viral breathing-related disorder, are needed. One option is to use monoclonal antibodies, which are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are two types of monoclonal antibodies. This evaluation is of the 3rd phase of a clinical study called BLAZE that examines bamlanivimab plus etesevimab in adults. The main result researchers look for is COVID-19 related hospital stays that lasted at least 24 hours or death. This result occurred in 2.1% of patients in the bamlanivimab/etesevimab group, compared to 7.0% in the placebo group. Based on opinions of experts, the FDA's efforts to shorten the approval process for medicines and for medical journals to make information available is admirable. However, these shortened processes make the details of the BLAZE study and producing accurate reviews difficult. It seems that if there are any benefits for bamlanivimab alone in COVID-19, they are not clear-cut. Bamlanivimab has limited effects against the beta and gamma variants of COVID-19 and is not effective against the delta variant. Therefore, the benefits of the bamlanivimab/etesevimab in phase 3 of the BLAZE-1 trial may be solely due to the etesevimab medicine, and this needs to be tested.",
12,2686220,"Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) as the main condition for the development of asthma may be modulated either by intrinsic or by extrinsic stimuli as well as by climatic and meteorologic factors. Proinflammatory mediators in combination with alterations of airway mucosa induce or amplify BHR. Upper airway viral infections, exposure to allergens in atopic subjects, chronic hyperplastic changes of the upper airways, airway irritants and analgesics are supposed to be the most likely asthma triggers in predisposed children and adults. There is the suggestion that BHR can be improved not only by treatment with steroidal and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs but also by maritime climatotherapy. The latter could be the result not only of the reduction of inhalative irritants, e.g. of allergen concentration, but also by the involvement or more complex mechanisms. Possible theoretic approaches and hypotheses regarding the mode of action of maritime climatic cures are discussed. First preliminary results obtained in a mediterranean region have demonstrated a negative impact of metereologic events like passages of cold weather fronts or increase of wind velocity on the course of asthma disease. An improvement of BHR assessed by histamine challenge test has been observed at the end of climatotherapy in the Baltic sea area. Prospective studies about asthma prevention in subjects at risk with BHR and atopy that have been starting should contribute to the evaluation of the therapeutic effects and the prognostic importance of maritime climatotherapy for getting exact scientific indications for climatotherapy in patients with bronchial asthma.","Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is an increase in sensitivity to different things that cause the airway to narrow. When BHR is the main cause of developing asthma, BHR may be adjusted by internal and external factors as well as by climate and meterologic (atmosphere, humidity, wind, temperature) factors. Inflammation that can make the disease worse, combined with changes in the mucus of airways, brings on or increases bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Viral infections in the upper airway (the nose, nasal cavity, and pharynx or throat area), exposure to allergens in people with tendencies to have an allergy, long-lasting hyperplastic changes (extra cell growth) of the upper airways, irritants (substances that cause discomfort) and pain drugs in the airways are seen as the most likely asthma triggers in vulnerable children and adults. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) may be improved with steroid (man-made drugs with a synthetic hormone) and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (drugs that relieve pain) and with maritime climatotherapy, where a patient is relocated to a different location close to the sea for health reasons. Maritime climatotherapy may improve BHR by reducing the level of irritants inhaled from the air. How maritime climatic cures work are discussed. Metereological (weather) events such as cold weather fronts have shown a negative impact on how asthma disease progresses. An improvement of BHR is observed at the end of climatotherapy using the histamine challenge test, which tests how sensitive airways are to irritants. Future studies on asthma prevention in patients at risk with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and atopy (allergies) should evaluate the effects and importance of maritime climatotherapy.","Bronchial hypperresponsiveness (increased lung sensitivity to airway-narrowing particles) or BHR as the main reason for developing asthma (a disease restricting breathing) may be modified by internal or external causes and environmental factors. Proinflammatory particles with changes to throat mucus promote BHR. Upper airway viral infections, allergen exposure, lasting enlargement of upper airways, airway irritants and pain-relievers may be the most common triggers of asthma in susceptible people. BHR may be improved by treatment with antiinflammatory drugs and coastal weather. Improvement with coastal weather may be because of reduced inhalative irritants and more complex reasons. Possible ideas regarding the means of coastal weather cures are explored. First, initial results from a mediterranean region show a negative effect of weather events like cold weather or faster wind speeds on the progression of asthma. BHR improvement measured by lung response tests has been observed after weather therapy in the Baltic sea area. Future studies about preventing asthma in people prone to BHR and allergy development should help with evaluating treatment effects and the importance of coastal weather therapy for those with bronchial asthma."
48,34681945,"Therapeutic success in treating patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is limited by the multivariate disease etiology, multi-organ presentation, systemic involvement, and complex immunopathogenesis. Agents targeting B-cell differentiation and survival are not efficacious for all patients, indicating a need to target other inflammatory mediators. One such target is the type I interferon pathway. Type I interferons upregulate interferon gene signatures and mediate critical antiviral responses. Dysregulated type I interferon signaling is detectable in many patients with SLE and other autoimmune diseases, and the extent of this dysregulation is associated with disease severity, making type I interferons therapeutically tangible targets. The recent approval of the type I interferon-blocking antibody, anifrolumab, by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with SLE demonstrates the value of targeting this pathway. Nevertheless, the interferon pathway has pleiotropic biology, with multiple cellular targets and signaling components that are incompletely understood. Deconvoluting the complexity of the type I interferon pathway and its intersection with lupus disease pathology will be valuable for further development of targeted SLE therapeutics. This review summarizes the immune mediators of the interferon pathway, its association with disease pathogenesis, and therapeutic modalities targeting the dysregulated interferon pathway.","Successfully treating patients with systematic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells) is limited by the different causes, its presence in multiple organs and systems, and a complex immune response. Treatments that target certain inflammatory (infection-fighting) processes in the body may be needed for some patients. One such target is the type I interferon pathway, a specific immune system pathway. Type I interferons increase the production of interferon genes (genes that allow communication between cells to activate the immune system) and brings about critical immune responses to fight viruses. Problems with the signaling in type I interferons are found in patients with lupus, and the extent of the problem is connected to how serious the disease is, making type I interferons possible targets for treatment. The recent approval of the type I interferon-blocking antibody medicine, anifrolumab, by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating patients with lupus shows the value of targeting this pathway. Nevertheless, the interferon pathway has multiple cells and signaling parts that are not completely understood.

42,29179736,"Background: While the genomes of eukaryotes and Archaea both encode the histone-fold domain, only eukaryotes encode the core histone paralogs H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. With DNA, these core histones assemble into the nucleosomal octamer underlying eukaryotic chromatin. Importantly, core histones for H2A and H3 are maintained as neofunctionalized paralogs adapted for general bulk chromatin (canonical H2 and H3) or specialized chromatin (H2A. Z enriched at gene promoters and cenH3s enriched at centromeres). In this context, the identification of core histone-like ""doublets"" in the cytoplasmic replication factories of the Marseilleviridae (MV) is a novel finding with possible relevance to understanding the origin of eukaryotic chromatin. Here, we analyze and compare the core histone doublet genes from all known MV genomes as well as other MV genes relevant to the origin of the eukaryotic replisome. Results: Using different phylogenetic approaches, we show that MV histone domains encode obligate H2B-H2A and H4-H3 dimers of possible proto-eukaryotic origin. MV core histone moieties form sister clades to each of the four eukaryotic clades of canonical and variant core histones. This suggests that MV core histone moieties diverged prior to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations associated with paired linear chromosomes and variant histone octamer assembly. We also show that MV genomes encode a proto-eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II enzyme that forms a sister clade to eukaryotes. This is a relevant finding given that DNA topo II influences histone deposition and chromatin compaction and is the second most abundant nuclear protein after histones. Conclusions: The combined domain architecture and phylogenomic analyses presented here suggest that a primitive origin for MV histone genes is a more parsimonious explanation than horizontal gene transfers + gene fusions + sufficient divergence to eliminate relatedness to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations within the H2A and H3 clades without loss of relatedness to each of the four core histone clades. We thus suggest MV histone doublet genes and their DNA topo II gene possibly were acquired from an organism with a chromatinized replisome that diverged prior to the origin of eukaryotic core histone variants for H2/H2A.Z and H3/cen H3. These results also imply that core histones were utilized ancestrally in viral DNA compaction and/or protection from host endonucleases.","Eukaryotes are cells commonly identified by having a nucleus (chamber to hold DNA). Eukaryotes provide genetic instructions to the following histone proteins that are similar but not identical: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. With DNA, these core histones come together into the basic structural unit of DNA packaging called the nucleosomal octamer. Importantly, histones for H2A and H3 are maintained as genes that develop a new function and are applied for chromatin, a substance within a chromosome made up of DNA and protein. In this context, the identification of core histone-like genes in the fluid that fills cells in Marseilleviridae viruses is a new finding with possible importance to understanding the origin of eukaryotic chromatin. This study analyzes and compares core histone-like genes from the genes of all known Marseilleviridae viruses, as well as other Marseilleviridae genes relevant to the beginning of the eukaryotic DNA replication machine. Using different approaches, researchers show that Marseilleviridae histone provide genetic information to H2B-H2A and H4-H3 structures. Marseilleviridae core histones form similar copies to each of the four eukaryotic histone groups. This suggests that parts of the Marseilleviridae core histone changed before eukaryotes changed functions. Researchers also show that Marseilleviridae genes provide information to other enzymes that form organisms similar to eukaryotes. This is a relevant finding given that DNA unwinding enzymes influences histone structure and the folding of DNA and is the second most abundant nuclear protein after histones. In conclusion, an early origin for Marseilleviridae histone genes is a more limited explanation than gene transfers + gene fusions + enough changes to remove relatedness to eukaryotic changes in functions within the H2A and H3. It is suggested that Marseilleviridae histone genes and their DNA genes are possibly taken from an organism that can replicate DNA that diverged before the beginning of eukaryotic core histone types for H2/H2A.Z and H3/cen H3. These results also imply that core histones are used in viral DNA folding and/or protection from viral-degrading, host enzymes called endonucleases.","While DNA of multi-celled and some one-celled organisms both encode a specific DNA-binding region, only multi-celled organisms encode the core proteins that DNA wraps around (core histones). With DNA, these core histones assemble into an 8-piece in the nucleus that binds DNA in multi-celled organisms. Importantly, certain core histones are kept as proteins capable of general-purpose or region-specific DNA-binding proteins. In this context, identifying core histone-like ""duplicates"" in the replication factories for the virus Marseilleviridae (MV) is a new finding with usefuleness to understanding the origin of chromosomes in multi-celled organisms (eukaryotes). Here, we analyze the core histone duplicate genes from all known MV genes and other MV genes related to the origin of the DNA replication site for multi-celled organisms. With different evolutionary approaches, we show that specific MV DNA-binding areas encode necessary histones of possible pre-eukaryotic origin. MV core histones form similar groups to each of the four eukaryotic groups of known and variant core histones. MV core histone groups may have divered before eukaryotic duplicate genes gained new functions (neofunctionalization) associated with paired linear chromosomes and variable histone group assembly. We also show that MV genes encode a pre-eukaryotic DNA replication enzyme that forms a sister group to eukaryotes. This is a useful finding since these DNA replication enzymes affect histone settlement and DNA compaction and is the second most common nuclear protein after histones. The combined region architecture and evolutionary analyses shown here suggest a primitive origin for MV histone genes is a tighter explanation than gene transfers + fusions + mutations to eliminate relatedenss to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations within histone groups without loss of relatedness to each of the four core histone sister groups. We thus suggest that MV histone doublet genes and their DNA replication gene were possible obtained from an organism with a specific DNA replication site that diverged before the origin of eukaryotic core histone variation. Core histones may have been used before in viral DNA compaction and protection from host proteins."
31,30791698,"Background: Tardive dyskinesia is a movement disorder characterised by irregular, stereotyped, and choreiform movements associated with the use of antipsychotic medication. We aim to provide recommendations on the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. Results: Preventing tardive dyskinesia is of primary importance, and clinicians should follow best practice for prescribing antipsychotic medication, including limiting the prescription for specific indications, using the minimum effective dose, and minimising the duration of therapy. The first-line management of tardive dyskinesia is the withdrawal of antipsychotic medication if clinically feasible. Yet, for many patients with serious mental illness, the discontinuation of antipsychotics is not possible due to disease relapse. Switching from a first-generation to a second-generation antipsychotic with a lower D2 affinity, such as clozapine or quetiapine, may be effective in reducing tardive dyskinesia symptoms. The strongest evidence for a suitable co-intervention to treat tardive dyskinesia comes from tests with the new VMAT inhibitors, deutetrabenazine and valbenazine. These medications have not been approved for use in Canada. Conclusion: Data on tardive dyskinesia treatment are limited, and the best management strategy remains prevention. More long-term safety and efficacy data are needed for deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, and their routine availability to patients outside of the USA remains in question.","Tardive duskinesia is a movement disorder of irregular, repetitive, and jerking movements linked with using antipsychotic medication for treating mental illnesses.

The first recommended treatment of tardive dyskinesia is to have the patient stop taking antipsychotics if possible. Stopping antipsychotics is not possible for many patients with serious mental illness due to the disease returning.

46,29402832,"Background/aims: The CFTR-Associated Ligand (CAL), a PDZ domain containing protein with two coiled-coil domains, reduces cell surface WT CFTR through degradation in the lysosome by a well-characterized mechanism. However, CAL's regulatory effect on ΔF508 CFTR has remained almost entirely uninvestigated. Methods: In this study, we describe a previously unknown pathway for CAL by which it regulates the membrane expression of ΔF508 CFTR through arrest of ΔF508 CFTR trafficking in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) using a combination of cell biology, biochemistry and electrophysiology. Results: We demonstrate that CAL is an ER localized protein that binds to ΔF508 CFTR and is degraded in the 26S proteasome. When CAL is inhibited, ΔF508 CFTR retention in the ER decreases and cell surface expression of mature functional ΔF508 CFTR is observed alongside of enhanced expression of plasma membrane scaffolding protein NHERF1. Chaperone proteins regulate this novel process, and ΔF508 CFTR binding to HSP40, HSP90, HSP70, VCP, and Aha1 changes to improve ΔF508 CFTR cell surface trafficking. Conclusion: Our results reveal a pathway in which CAL regulates the cell surface availability and intracellular retention of ΔF508 CFTR.","The CFTR-Associated Ligand (CAL) reduces the cell surface of normal CFTR through destroying it in a well-understood way. The CFTR protein is a channel involved with movement of ions (charged atoms) and fluids in epithelial cells (cells that cover the outer surface of the internal organs). However, few scientists have studied how CAL controls ΔF508 CFTR, a specific gene sequence change seen in the CFTR gene which slightly alters the CFTR protein. In this study, we describe a previously unknown way CAL controls ΔF508 CFTR through stopping ΔF508 CFTR movement in the cell's transportation system. We show that CAL binds to ΔF508 CFTR in one location of the cell and is destroyed in another location of the cell. When CAL is stopped, the amount of ΔF508 CFTR held within the cell decreases and working ΔF508 CFTR is seen on the cell surface. The binding of ΔF508 CFTR to proteins improves the cell surface movement conducted by ΔF508 CFTR. We conclude that CAL controls the cell surface availability and amount held within the cell of ΔF508 CFTR.",
22,32279295,"Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline loss-of-function mutations in Folliculin gene (FLCN). BHD is characterized by lower lobe-predominant pulmonary cysts with risk of pneumothorax, benign skin tumors (fibrofolliculomas), and renal cell carcinoma, often of an unusual chromophobe/oncocytic hybrid histology. The FLCN protein functions in multiple signaling and metabolic pathways including positive regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity via FLCN's GTPase (GAP) activity for Rag C, positive regulation of Wnt signaling (in mesenchymal cells), and negative regulation of TFE3 nuclear localization. Therefore, FLCN-deficient cells are predicted to have reduced mTORC1 and Wnt activity and enhanced TFE3 activity. Folliculin also has functions in autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, cell-cell adhesion, 5' AMP activated protein kinase activity, and other pathways. The specific contributions of these pathways to the lung manifestations of BHD are largely unknown. This review is focused on the pulmonary manifestations of BHD, highlighting selected recent advances in elucidating the cellular functions of FLCN and current hypotheses related to the pathogenesis of cystic lung disease in BHD, including the ""stretch hypothesis."" We also discuss important knowledge gaps in the field, including the genetic, cellular and physical mechanisms of cyst pathogenesis, and the timing of cyst initiation, which may occur during lung development.","Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is an genetic disorder caused by a loss-of-function mutations in the Folliculin gene (FLCN), a gene that stops or slows tumor growth. A common characteristic of Birt-Hogg-Dubé is pulmonary cysts (sacs filled with air in the lungs) that are mostly located in the bottom of the lung. There is also the risk of a collapsed lung, when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall, non-cancerous skin tumors, and kidney cancer. The FLCN protein has different functions in the body, including signaling to other cells and supervising the formation of other proteins. Therefore, FLCN cells that are damaged are thought to have reduced activity in other proteins and increase activity in others that may lead to the development of kidney tumors. Folliculin also has other functions including cleaning out damaged cells, helping cells connect with other cells, and working with enzymes that activate the proteins that regular cell energy and fuel.

35,22256806,"BACKGROUND: Although bone mineral density (BMD) testing to screen for osteoporosis (BMD T score, −2.50 or lower) is recommended for women 65 years of age or older, there are few data to guide decisions about the interval between BMD tests. METHODS: We studied 4957 women, 67 years of age or older, with normal BMD (T score at the femoral neck and total hip, −1.00 or higher) or osteopenia (T score, −1.01 to −2.49) and with no history of hip or clinical vertebral fracture or of treatment for osteoporosis, followed prospectively for up to 15 years. The BMD testing interval was defined as the estimated time for 10% of women to make the transition to osteoporosis before having a hip or clinical vertebral fracture, with adjustment for estrogen use and clinical risk factors. Transitions from normal BMD and from three subgroups of osteopenia (mild, moderate, and advanced) were analyzed with the use of parametric cumulative incidence models. Incident hip and clinical vertebral fractures and initiation of treatment with bisphosphonates, calcitonin, or raloxifene were treated as competing risks. RESULTS: The estimated BMD testing interval was 16.8 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5 to 24.6) for women with normal BMD, 17.3 years (95% CI, 13.9 to 21.5) for women with mild osteopenia, 4.7 years (95% CI, 4.2 to 5.2) for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1.1 years (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) for women with advanced osteopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that osteoporosis would develop in less than 10% of older, post-menopausal women during rescreening intervals of approximately 15 years for women with normal bone density or mild osteopenia, 5 years for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1 year for women with advanced osteopenia.","Although bone mineral density (BMD) testing to measure how much calcium and other minerals are in bones to look for osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) is suggested for women 65 years old or older, few studies look at how long to wait between tests. We studied 4957 women, 67 years old and older, with normal BMD or weaker than normal bones who had never broken a hip or spine or received treatment for osteoporosis, followed for up to 15 years. The time between BMD testing was the estimated time for 10% of women to develop osteoporosis before breaking a hip or spine, considering estrogen (female-specific hormone) use and risk factors. We used mathematical models to look at changes from normal BMD and from mild, moderate, and advanced osteopenia. We considered hip and spine breaks and people taking drugs to strengthen bones. We found the estimated time between BMD testing was 16.8 years for women with normal BMD and 17.3, 4.7. and 1.1 years for women with mild, moderate, and advanced osteopenia, respectively. Our results suggest that less than 10% of older women who had gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) would develop osteoporosis if tested about every 15 years for women with normal BMD or mild osteopenia, 5 years for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1 year for women with advanced osteopenia.",
29,32784601,"Objectives: The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) conveys a serious threat globally to health and economy because of a lack of vaccines and specific treatments. A common factor for conditions that predispose for serious progress is a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart failure, to which micronutrient deficiencies may contribute. The aim of the present article was to explore the usefulness of early micronutrient intervention, with focus on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, to relieve escalation of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an online search for articles published in the period 2010-2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and corona and related virus infections. Results: There were a few studies providing direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and COVID-19. Adequate supply of zinc, selenium, and vitamin D is essential for resistance to other viral infections, immune function, and reduced inflammation. Hence, it is suggested that nutrition intervention securing an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate the course of COVID-19. Conclusion: We recommended initiation of adequate supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in high-risk groups should have high priority as regards this nutritive adjuvant therapy, which should be started prior to administration of specific and supportive medical measures.","The new Covid-19 (a viral, respiratory disease) is a serious threat to health and financial stability because of a lack of vaccines and treatments. Low-grade inflammation (how the body responds to infection) is a common factor in cases that become more serious, and low levels of vitamins and minerals may contribute to this inflammation. The aim of this paper is to explore the usefulness of starting certain vitamins and minerals early, especially zinc, selenium (a mineral found in water and foods), and vitamin D, to keep Covid-19 infections from becoming more serious. Researchers did an online search for scientific articles published from 2010 to 2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, in addition to corona and similar virus infections. There are a few studies that show direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and Covid-19. Getting enough zinc, selenium, and vitamin D is important for the body to resist other viral infections, as well as for immune function and to reduce inflammation, which is the body's response to infections.

34,31573641,"Importance: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 16th leading cause of years of life lost worldwide. Appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management by primary care clinicians are necessary to prevent adverse CKD-associated outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death. Observations: Defined as a persistent abnormality in kidney structure or function (eg, glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or albuminuria ≥30 mg per 24 hours) for more than 3 months, CKD affects 8% to 16% of the population worldwide. In developed countries, CKD is most commonly attributed to diabetes and hypertension. However, less than 5% of patients with early CKD report awareness of their disease. Among individuals diagnosed as having CKD, staging and new risk assessment tools that incorporate GFR and albuminuria can help guide treatment, monitoring, and referral strategies. Optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction (eg, statins and blood pressure management), treatment of albuminuria (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers), avoidance of potential nephrotoxins (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and adjustments to drug dosing (eg, many antibiotics and oral hypoglycemic agents). Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and anemia. Those at high risk of CKD progression (eg, estimated GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, albuminuria ≥300 mg per 24 hours, or rapid decline in estimated GFR) should be promptly referred to a nephrologist.

Among people diagnosed as having CKD, new risk assessment tools can help guide treatment, monitoring, and inform when to send patients to a specialist. These new tools include using the glomerular filtration rate, a blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working, and albuminuria, which is too much albumin (a blood protein) in the urine. The best management of CKD includes reducing risk of heart disease, treating albuminuria, avoiding medications that are toxic to the kidneys, and changes to drug dosing, such as antibiotics. Patients also need monitoring for complications with CKD, such as higher than normal potassium levels, too much acid in the fluids of the body, too much phosphorus in the blood, low vitamin D, overactive glands in the neck that produce parathyroid (calcium-regulating) hormone, and anemia (low red blood cells). Those at high risk of chronic kidney disease progression based on tests that check how well the kidneys are working or too much albumin (a protein) in the urine, which is called albuminuria, should be quickly sent to a kidney specialist. Diagnosis, determining the stage, and appropriate referral of chronic kidney disease by primary care doctors are important in reducing the negative impact of chronic kidney disease worldwide.",

Vaccination is a safe, simple, and effective way of protecting a person against COVID-19. By the end of August 2021, only 24.6% of the world population has received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Since the emergence of COVID-19, several COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and approved for emergency use. Current vaccines have shown efficacy with low risk of adverse effects. However, COVID-19 vaccines have been related to a relatively small number of cases of heart inflammation, anaphylaxis (allergic reactions), and blood clots formation. On the other hand, COVID-19 vaccination is not recommended for children less than 12 years of age. Furthermore, It has been proposed that some new variants (e.g., Lambda and Delta) are proficient in escaping from the antiviral immunity elicited by vaccination. Herein we present current considerations regarding the COVID-19 vaccines including: efficacy against new variants, challenges in distribution, disparities in availability, dosage gender and race difference, COVID-19 vaccine transport and storage, limitations in children and pregnant women.

8,33449568,"We have found oral perphenazine 8 mg (OP8) useful as follows: (1) as a nonsedating antiemetic; (2) as a preventative measure similar to the antihistamine promethazine against ketamine-induced psychotomimetic effects; and (3) as a safe single-dose drug (only 1.3 extrapyramidal events per 10,000 patients receiving 4–8 mg oral dose, with all events easily treated). Additionally, we evaluated the efficacy of single-dose OP8 to a single 40 mg dose of aprepitant given preoperatively in colorectal surgery patients at our academic center within an enhanced recovery protocol, which was designed to mitigate opioid utilization, reduce Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV), and optimize patient recovery. In this retrospective study, no differences were noted in antiemetic requirement on postoperative days 0 and 1 between patients receiving OP8 versus aprepitant. As enhanced recovery protocols become more widespread and continue to be applied to other surgical specialties, effective PONV prevention is imperative for improving patient outcomes. OP8 deserves to be properly evaluated (by clinical study, and/or in routine clinical practice) as a part of a cost-effective multimodal enhanced recovery strategy.","Perphenazine 8 mg (OP8) can be taken by mouth for the following uses: (1) as a nonsedating drug to prevent nausea and vomiting; (2) like promethazine, an antihistamine (allergy drug) , to prevent psychotic symptoms caused by ketamine (a pain relief drug); and (3) as a safe one-dose drug. We also rated the success of one-dose OP8 compared to one 40 mg dose of aprepitant, used to prevent nausea and vomiting, given to people before rectum, anus, and colon operations in our center with guidelines designed to help people recover more quickly from surgery, reduce opioid use, and reduce nausea and vomiting after surgery. In this study, we saw no differences in nausea and vomiting prevention on the same day of surgery and one day after surgery between patients who got OP8 versus aprepitant. As guidelines to help people recover more quickly from surgery become more widespread and used for other surgeries, successfully preventing nausea and vomiting after surgery is key to improving patient results. OP8 should be studied as part of a cost-effective, multi-process way to help people recover more quickly from surgery.",
13,30571183,"Background: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) can be caused by gain-of-function mutations in genes, encoding the cardiac potassium channel subunits KCNJ2, KCNE1, and KCNH2 that mediate the repolarizing potassium currents Ik1, Iks, and Ikr, respectively. Methods: Linkage analysis, whole-exome sequencing, and Xenopus oocyte electrophysiology studies were used in this study. Results: Through genetic studies, we showed that autosomal dominant early-onset nocturnal paroxysmal AF is caused by p.S447R mutation in KCND2, encoding the pore-forming (α) subunit of the Kv4.2 cardiac potassium channel. Kv4.2, along with Kv4.3, contributes to the cardiac fast transient outward K+ current, Ito. Ito underlies the early phase of repolarization in the cardiac action potential, thereby setting the initial potential of the plateau phase and governing its duration and amplitude. In Xenopus oocytes, the mutation increased the channel's inactivation time constant and affected its regulation: p.S447 resides in a protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site, which normally allows attenuation of Kv4.2 membrane expression. The mutant Kv4.2 exhibited impaired response to PKC; hence, Kv4.2 membrane expression was augmented, enhancing potassium currents. Coexpression of mutant and wild-type channels (recapitulating heterozygosity in affected individuals) showed results similar to the mutant channel alone. Finally, in a hybrid channel composed of Kv4.3 and Kv4.2, simulating the mature endogenous heterotetrameric channel underlying Ito, the p.S447R Kv4.2 mutation exerted a gain-of-function effect on Kv4.3. Conclusions: The mutation alters Kv4.2's kinetic properties, impairs its inhibitory regulation, and exerts gain-of-function effect on both Kv4.2 homotetramers and Kv4.2-Kv4.3 heterotetramers. These effects presumably increase the repolarizing potassium current Ito, thereby abbreviating action potential duration, creating arrhythmogenic substrate for nocturnal AF. Interestingly, Kv4.2 expression was previously shown to demonstrate circadian variation, with peak expression at daytime in murine hearts (human nighttime), with possible relevance to the nocturnal onset of paroxysmal AF symptoms in our patients. The atrial-specific phenotype suggests that targeting Kv4.2 might be effective in the treatment of nocturnal paroxysmal AF, avoiding adverse ventricular effects.","Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) (an irregular heart rate that returns to normal within 7 days on its own or with treatment) can be caused by mutations in genes. Genetic linkage analysis to trace diseases in families using genes, whole-exome sequencing to find a genetic cause of a disease, and models to study biological processes of cells were used in this study. Through these genetic studies, researchers show that one genetic trait or mutation that is passed down from parent to child causing nighttime paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is caused by a mutation in the KCND2 gene. Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 are potassium channels that release potassium from cells and contribute to the heart-related, temporary, fast, outward potassium (K+) current, Ito. Ito is the base of the early phase of repolarization (when the outward current of ions exceeds the inward current) in the cardiac action potental (where unique properties necessary for function of the electrical conduction system of the heart occur), and creates the initial potential of the plateau phase (the time that allows for longer muscle contraction and allows the heart to contract in a steady, uniform, and forceful manner). In studies that modeled the cell's biology, the mutation increased the potassium channel's inactivation time (the time when the channel no longer allows potassium to be passed through it) and affected its regulation. The mutant Kv4.2 showed an impaired response to protein kinase C (PKC), a protein that regulates cells growth and plays a major role in sending signals to the heart.  The gene mutation alters Kv4.2's transfer properties, impairs its regulation process, and exerts gain-of-function effect (changes the activity or function of a protein) in both Kv4.2 and Kv4.2-Kv4.3 potassium channels. These effects possibly increase the repolarizing potassium current Ito, creating arrhythmogenic substrates (factors that can produce or lead to arrhythmia) for nocturnal atrial fibrillation (an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm occuring at night that can lead to blood clots in the heart). Kv4.2 expression has previously been shown to demonstrate circadian variation (the natural, internal process that regulates the sleep–wake cycle and repeats roughly every 24 hours), with peak expression at daytime, with possible relevance to the nighttime onset of symptoms of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rate that returns to normal within 7 days on its own or with treatment) in patients. Targeting Kv4.2 might be effective in the treatment of nocturnal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.",
45,34414933,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Ma Yinglong Shexiang Hemorrhoids Cream combined with pearl powder on pain and complications in patients with severe pressure ulcers. Methods: One hundred seventeen patients with severe pressure ulcers hospitalized and treated in our hospital (January 2019--December 2019) were divided into Ma Yinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Cream Group (MY Group), Pearl Powder Group (PP Group), and combination with Ma Yinglong Musk Hemorrhoid Cream and Pearl Powder Group (MP group), 39 patients in each group. There was no significant difference in the general data of patients in MY group, PP group, and MP group. By analyzing the differences in clinical efficacy, secondary effects, scar incidence, pain, and clinical indicators of patients in the MY group, PP group, and MP group, the effects of Mayinglong Shexiang Hemorrhoid Cream combined with pearl powder in the treatment of pain and complications in patients with severe pressure ulcers were explored. Results: After treatment, compared with the MY group and the PP group, the MP group had a higher clinical efficacy than the MY group and the PP group. Compared with MY group and PP group, the healing time, dressing change times, and dressing change time of MP group were better than MY group (P < .05). After treatment, the VAS score and incidence of secondary effects of the MP group was significantly lower than that of the MY group and PP group (P < .05). The incidence and area of scar formation in the MP group were lower than those in the MY group and the PP group (P < .05).

The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19. Methods: This phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 99 centers across the United States. Persons at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 μg) or placebo 28 days apart. The primary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Results: The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and analyses in participants 65 years of age or older.

The 3rd phase of a clinical study is conducted in 99 centers across the United States. People who are at a high risk for the coronavirus or its complications are randomly placed in either the group to receive two shots of the mRNA-1273 vaccine or in the placebo group (people will be given a shot of an inactive substance). The main result researchers are interested in is the prevention of Covid-19 starting at least 14 days after the second shot in study participants who have not already been infected with coronavirus. The trial includes 30,420 volunteers who are randomly placed in a group to receive the vaccine or to receive the placebo. More than 96% of volunteer participants receive both shots, and 2.2% are positive for (or have) the coronavirus at the start of the study. Covid-19 is found in 185 participants in the placebo group and in 11 people in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group. The effectiveness of the vaccine is 94.1%. In additional analyses, the vaccine is found to be effective during the patient evaluation 14 days after the first dose, in participants who were positive for coronavirus at the start of the study, and in participants 65 years old or older. Serious Covid-19 occurs in 30 participants, with one death. All 30 are in the placebo group.

16,6445384,"The effects of single oral doses of 10, 15, or 30 mg of prednisone on circulating mononuclear cells, autologous MLR, mitogen responses, and allogeneic MLR were studied in healthy volunteers. Doses as low as 10 mg were immunosuppressive, causing diminution of circulating T cells and monocytes, and significant reduction in autologous but not allogeneic MLR responses. These effects were maximal 6 hr after drug administration and gone by 24 hr. Autologous MLR responses were particularly sensitive to the effects of prednisone being significantly and consistently suppressed 2 hr after drug administration, before significant cell redistribution had occurred. Macrophage-enriched stimulating cells were more easily suppressed than responding T cells. Since the autologous MLR may be important in in vivo regulation of immune responses, its reduction by low-dose glucocorticoids may be of clinical relevance. This suppressive effect must be considered in studies of the autologous MLR in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy.","The effects of single oral (by mouth) doses of prednisone (a type of man-made steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling) on circulating mononuclear cells (major cells in the body that signal the immune system), autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) (the availability of non T-cells to stimulate T-cells), mitogen responses (to help measure immune response), and allogeneic MLR (grouping of white blood cells called lymphocytes from unrelated individuals resulting in T cell activation) are studied in healthy volunteers. Low doses were immunosuppressive (drugs or medicines that lower the body's ability to reject a transplanted organ), causing reduced circulation and amounts of T-cells (a type of immune cell that help protect the body from infection) and monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria that enter the body), and major losses in autologous but not allogeneic MLR responses. The maximum effect occurred 6 hours after the drug is provided, and effects are gone by 24 hours. Autologous MLR responses are very sensitive to the effects of prednisone and were significantly and consistently slowed or stopped 2 hours after the drug was provided. Macrophage-enriched stimulating cells (a type of white blood cell that surrounds and kills foreign organisms like bacteria and activates other immune system cells) were more easily slowed than responding T cells. Because autologous MLR may be important in in vivo (experiments within a living human or animal) monitoring of immune responses, its reduction by low dose glucocorticoids (medicines that fight inflammation and work with your immune system) may be important. This suppressive (slowing down) effect must be considered in studies of the autologous MLR in patients receiving glucocorticoid drugs.",
13,19009769,"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is associated with different types of cardiac arrhythmias. The original studies, concentrated mostly on nocturnal brady- and tachyarrhythmias.

17,460879,"The tongue is the most common cause of upper airway obstruction, a situation seen most often in patients who are comatose or who have suffered cardiopulmonary arrest. Other common causes of upper airway obstruction include edema of the oropharynx and larynx, trauma, foreign body, and infection. The management of the patient with upper airway obstruction depends upon the cause of the obstruction, the training and skills of the rescuer, and the availability of adjuncts necessary to perform advanced airway techniques. In most cases, merely positioning the patient or performing one of the three maneuvers designed to elevate the tongue will open the airway of the comatose patient or the victim of cardiac arrest. In patients with suspected foreign body obstruction, abdominal or chest compression should be performed immediately, with digital extraction of the foreign body reserved for those in whom these maneuvers are unsuccessful. Most patients with obstruction secondary to edema, trauma, or infection can be managed initially with orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation. Intubation should be attempted prior to surgical management of the airway in most cases of upper airway obstruction. Occasionally, however, cricothyroidotomy or tracheostomy is necessary to establish an airway. The choice of technique depends primarily on the experience and skills of the rescuing physician or paramedic. In most cases, cricothyroidotomy is technically more simple and more easily performed than tracheotomy, especially for the physician who has not been trained in surgery or otolaryngology and for the nonphysician rescuer. No matter what the method employed in establishing an airway in a patient with upper airway obstruction, it must be performed quickly and a source of ventilation provided for the patient once the airway has been secured.","The tongue is the most common cause of blocked upper airways, seen most often in people in comas or cardiac arrest (abrupt heart stop). Other common causes of blocked upper airways include swelling of the middle part of the throat and voice box, injury, objects that shouldn’t be swallowed, and infection. Treatment of the patient with blocked upper airways depends on the cause of the blockage, the training and skills of the rescuer, and the availability of additional treatments needed for advanced airway methods. In most cases, simply positioning the patient or doing one of the three maneuvers to raise the tongue will open the airway of the patient in a coma or cardiac arrest. In people thought to have swallowed an object that should not be swallowed, stomach or chest compression should be done immediately, with removing the object with the fingers used only when these maneuvers do not work. Most people with blocked airways that occur due to swelling, injury, or infection can be treated first without breathing tubes through the mouth or nose. Breathing tubes should be used before surgery in most instances of blocked upper airways. Sometimes, however, surgery to cut a hole in the neck is needed to open the airway. The experience and skills of the rescuing doctor or paramedic mostly determines the approach. Usually, a surgery to cut a hole in the neck is simpler and easier to do than opening the windpipe, especially for a doctor who does not have surgery training or the rescuer who is not a doctor. Regardless of the method used to open the airway in a patient with blocked upper airways, it must be done quickly, and air must be supplied to the person once the airway is open.","The tongue is the most common cause of airway blockage, especially in comatose patients or those suffering cardiac arrest. Other common causes of airway blockage include swelling from trapped fluid of the airway, trauma, something stuck in the airway, and infection.

35,15549501,"Osteoporosis and its consequent increase in fracture risk is a major health concern for postmenopausal women and older men and has the potential to reach epidemic proportions. The ""gold standard"" for osteoporosis diagnosis is bone densitometry. However, economic issues or availability of the technology may prevent the possibility of mass screening. The goal of this study was to develop and validate a clinical scoring index designed as a prescreening tool to help clinicians identify which women are at increased risk of osteoporosis [bone mineral density (BMD) T-score -2.5 or less] and should therefore undergo further testing with bone densitometry. Records were analyzed for 1522 postmenopausal females over 50 years of age who had undergone testing with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Osteoporosis risk index scores were compared to bone density T-scores. Hologic QDR 4500 technology was used to measure BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine (L1-L4). Participants who had a previous diagnosis of osteoporosis or were taking bone-active medication were excluded. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to identify the specific cutpoint value that would identify women at increased risk of low BMD. A simple algorithm based on age, weight, history of previous low impact fracture, early menopause, and corticosteroid therapy was developed. Validation of this five-item osteoporosis prescreening risk assessment (OPERA) index showed that the tool, at the recommended threshold (or cutoff value) of two, had a sensitivity that ranged from 88.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean: 86.2-91.9%] at the femoral neck to 90% (95% CI for the mean: 86.1-93.1%) at the lumbar spine area. Corresponding specificity values were 60.6 (95% CI for the mean: 57.9-63.3%) and 64.2% (95% CI for the mean: 61.4-66.9%), respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) ranged from 29 at the femoral neck to 39.2% at the lumbar spine, while the corresponding negative predictive values (NPVs) reached 96.5 and 96.2%, respectively. Based on this cutoff value, the area under the ROC curve was 0.866 (95% CI for the mean: 0.847-0.882) for the lumbar spine and 0.814 (95% CI for the mean: 0.793-0.833) for the femoral neck. We conclude that the OPERA is a free and effective method for identifying Italian postmenopausal women at increased risk of osteoporosis. Its use could facilitate the appropriate and more cost-effective use of bone densitometry in developing countries.","Osteoporosis, a condition in which bones become weak and brittle, and the increase in the risk of bone breaks it causes has worried women who have gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) and older men and could become a huge problem. The best way to diagnose osteoporosis is bone densitometry, a common test to measure bone density. Large-scale checks may not be possible due to economic issues or availability of densitometry. We aimed to make and test a scoring system to help doctors find which women are more likely to develop osteoporosis and should have more testing with bone densitometry. We looked at records for 1522 women who have gone through menopause over 50 years old who had dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA - a common test for bone density). We compared risk scores to bone density tests. We measured BMD at the hip and lower spine. We excluded people who were previously diagnosed with osteoporosis or were taking drugs affecting bones. We came up with a simple calculation based on age, weight, history of previous falls from a standing height or lower, early menopause, and use of a certain kind of steroid. Testing of this five-item osteoporosis prescreening risk assessment (OPERA) shows high accuracy for osteoporosis detection. OPERA shows high accuracy for no detection. The accuracy for results detecting osteoporosis ranged from 29 at the femoral neck to 39.2% at the lumbar spine, while the corresponding accuracy for results not detecting osteoporosis reached 96.5 and 96.2%, respectively. We conclude that the OPERA is a free and effective way to identify Italian women who have gone through menopause at higher risk of osteoporosis. Use of OPERA could help the appropriate and more cost-effective use of bone densitometry in developing countries.",
30,32935877,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) collection began in two Brazilian hospitals for treatment of severe/critical patients. Methods and materials: Mild/moderate COVID-19 convalescents were selected as CCP donors after reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and absence of symptoms for ≥14 days plus (a) age (18-60 years), body weight greater than 55 kg; (b) immunohematological studies; (c) no infectious markers of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, human T-lymphotropic virus-1/2, Chagas and syphilis infection; (d) no HLA antibodies (multiparous); (e) second RT-PCR (nasopharyngeal swab and/or blood) negativity; (f) virus neutralization test (cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test neutralizing antibody) and anti-nucleocapsid protein SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Among 271 donors (41 females, 230 males), 250 presented with neutralizing antibodies. Final RT-PCR was negative on swab (77.0%) or blood (88.4%; P = .46). Final definition of RT-PCR was only defined at more than 28 days after full recovery in 59 of 174 (33.9%) RT-PCR -ve, and 25/69 RT-PCR +ve (36.2%; 13 between 35 and 48 days). Neutralizing antibody titers of 160 or greater were found in 63.6%. Correlation between IgG signal/cutoff of 5.0 or greater and neutralizing antibody of 160 or greater was 82.4%. Combination of final RT-PCR -ve with neutralizing antibody ≥160 was 41.3% (112/271). Serial plasma collection showed decline in neutralizing antibody titers and IgA levels (P < .05), probably denoting a ""golden period"" for CCP collection (≤28 days after joining the program); IgA might have an important role as neutralizing antibody. Donor's weight, days between disease onset and serial plasma collection, and IgG and IgM levels are important predictors for neutralizing antibody titer. Conclusions: RT-PCR +ve cases are still detected in 36.2% within 28 to 48 days after recovery. High anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG levels may be used as a surrogate marker to neutralizing antibody.","Collection of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the viral, respiratory illness Covid-19, also called convalescent plasma, began in two hospitals in Brazil for treatment of severe patients. People recovering from mild or moderate Covid-19 infection are selected as donors for blood plasma if they have had no symptoms for at least 14 days. Additional tests are done for other infections such as hepatitis and HIV and for antibodies (or infection-fighting proteins) for Covid-19. Among 271 blood plasma donors, 250 have antibodies in the body to fight Covid-19. In 77% of donors, no genetic trace of Covid-19 is found from a swab test and in 88.4%, none is found in blood. At more than 28 days after full recovery, 59 out of 174 are negative (with no virus detected), and 25 out of 69 are positive (with virus detected), but 13 of these are between 35 and 48 days. Additional tests are done to learn more about the level of antibodies in the blood.  Blood plasma collection showed a decline in antibodies that attach to the virus and keep it from entering cells. The donor's weight, days between the start of the disease and repeated plasma collection, and antibody levels are important for predicting possible antibody concentration that can keep the virus from entering cells. In conclusion, a positive test that finds genetic traces of the virus are still detected in 36.2% of cases within 28 to 48 days after recovery. High levels of certain antibody proteins may be used to identify antibodies that can neutralize the virus and make it inactive.",

23,30570999,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism (IEM) most often caused by missense mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) which catalyzes the hydroxylation of phenylalanine (Phe) generating tyrosine (Tyr). PKU belongs to a class of amino acid aminoacidopathies termed “toxic accumulation-IEMs” where the circulating toxin is an amino acid or its metabolites. Mutations in an enzyme, such as PAH, are recessive since one functioning enzyme with the wild-type allele is sufficient. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) binds to the catalytic domain of PAH and is a cofactor for this reaction. PAH is primarily a hepatic enzyme. Elevated blood Phe levels and decreased Tyr levels characterize PKU. Newborns with PKU can appear normal at birth with the first signs appearing after several months. These signs can include musty odor from skin and urine, fair skin, eczema, seizures, tremors, and hyperactivity.","Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disorder in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy often caused by not enough of a specific protein (phenylalanine hydroxylase, PAH) that changes one molecule (phenylalanine, Phe) into another molecule (tyrosine, Tyr). PKU is a type of molecular (amino acid) metabolism disorder called ""toxic accumulation IEMs,"" in which the buildup of the molecule is toxic. Changes to DNA of a protein, such as PAH, are made in both copies of the gene that is altered, because one working copy of the gene allows the protein to function. PAH is mainly a liver protein. PKU is associated with high blood Phe levels and low Tyr levels. Newborns with PKU can look normal at birth with the first signs showing many months later. Signs of PKU can include a musty smell from skin and pee, fair skin, red and itchy skin, seizures, tremors, and an active and disruptive behavior.",

Forty-two patients had been put on insulin (half within 6 months of diagnosis and the rest after up to 6 years). Of the 13 patients not on insulin, six were on diet alone and seven on oral hypoglycaemic agents after a median follow-up of 3 years. In 37 of the 42 patients, insulin treatment was started for clinical rather than immunological reasons (diabetic ketoacidosis, ketonuria, weight loss and/or severe symptoms). Five patients were started on insulin because of ICA status when there was no compelling reason on clinical grounds. Knowledge that seven non-insulin-treated patients were ICA positive made doctors reluctant to discharge them from clinic. The data suggest that routine ICA estimation in this age group is unnecessary, as the decision to treat with insulin is best made on clinical grounds, and ICA estimation can lead to unwarranted insulin treatment, or anxiety in patients and doctors who are aware of a positive result.","Checking all people with diabetes detected later in life for islet cell antibodies (ICA; proteins made against insulin-producing cells) may help predict dependence on insulin.

28,34585235,"Some studies reported that genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 can absorb a few host miRNAs that regulate immune-related genes and then deprive their function. In this perspective, we conjecture that the absorption of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to host miRNAs is not a coincidence, which may be an indispensable approach leading to viral survival and development in host. In our study, we collected five datasets of miRNAs that were predicted to interact with the genome of SARS-CoV-2. The targets of these miRNAs in the five groups were consistently enriched immune-related pathways and virus-infectious diseases. Interestingly, the five datasets shared no one miRNA but their targets shared 168 genes. The signaling pathway enrichment of 168 shared targets implied an unbalanced immune response that the most of interleukin signaling pathways and none of the interferon signaling pathways were significantly different. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using the shared targets showed that PPI pairs, including IL6-IL6R, were related to the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis. In addition, we found that SARS-CoV-2 absorption to host miRNA could benefit two popular mutant strains for more infectivity and pathogenicity. Conclusively, our results suggest that genomic RNA absorption to host miRNAs may be a vital approach by which SARS-CoV-2 disturbs the host immune system and infects host cells.","Some scientific reports have stated that RNA, or genetic material, from COVID-19 virus (a virus leading to lung infection) can absorb microRNA (small chains of RNA that cannot be coded into proteins) from the host. MiRNA can regulate immune system-related genes. When the virus absorbs this miRNA, it can deprive the genes of their ability to function. Using this knowledge, the authors hypothesized or theorized that the absorption of COVID-19 genetic material to host miRNA is not a coincidence. Therefore, this may be a pathway in which the virus survives and replicates within a host. In this study, the authors collected five datasets of miRNAs that were predicted to interact with the COVID-19 genetic material. The targets of the selected miRNA were pathways related to immune response and virus-infectious diseases. Interestingly, the five datasets had no repeated miRNA, but their targets shared 168 genes. A test analyzing the 168 shared targets implied an unbalanced immune response where most of the interleukin (a messenger protein) signaling pathways and none of the interferon (another messenger protein) signaling pathways were significantly different. A second test using the shared targets show protein-protein interaction pairs, including IL6 to IL6R. The test showed the pairs are related to the process of COVID-19 infection and development. Additionally, the authors found that COVID-19 absorption to host miRNA could help two popular viral strains to infect more and cause more damage in hosts.

BHD is caused by heterozygous, predominantly truncating mutations in the folliculin (FLCN) gene located on chromosome 17, which encodes a highly conserved tumor suppressor protein. Although management of renal tumors of low malignant potential is the primary focus of longitudinal care, pulmonary manifestations including cyst formation and spontaneous pneumothorax are among the most common manifestations in BHD. Due to the lack of awareness, there is commonly a delay in the pulmonary diagnosis of BHD and patients are frequently mislabeled as having chronic obstructive lung disease, emphysema or common bullae/blebs. A family history of pneumothorax is present in 35 % of patients with BHD. Certain imaging characteristics of the cysts, including size, basilar and peripheral predominance, perivascular and periseptal localization, and elliptical or lentiform shape can suggest the diagnosis of BHD based on inspection of the chest CT scan alone.

40,23641263,"Aim: A review is given on the different tools of compression therapy and their mode of action. Methods: Interface pressure and stiffness of compression devices, alone or in combination can be measured in vivo. Hemodynamic effects have been demonstrated by measuring venous volume and flow velocity using MRI, Duplex and radioisotopes, venous reflux and venous pumping function using plethysmography and phlebodynamometry. Oedema reduction can be measured by limb volumetry. Results: Compression stockings exerting a pressure of ~20 mm Hg on the distal leg are able to increase venous blood flow velocity in the supine position and to prevent leg swelling after prolonged sitting and standing. In the upright position, an interface pressure of more than 50 mmHg is needed for intermittent occlusion of incompetent veins and for a reduction of ambulatory venous hypertension during walking. Such high intermittent interface pressure peaks exerting a ""massaging effect"" may rather be achieved by short stretch multilayer bandages than by elastic stockings. Conclusion: Compression is a cornerstone in the management of venous and lymphatic insufficiency. However, this treatment modality is still underestimated and deserves better understanding and improved educational programs, both for patients and medical staff.","This study aimed to evaluate different tools used in compression therapy and assess (measure) how they work. The levels of pressure and stiffness of the compression devices, alone or in combination with other materials, can be measured on living organisms. Hemodynamic (blood flow) effects have been demonstrated by measuring venous (vein) volume and flow velocity using several testing methods. Venous reflux (reverse flow) and venous pumping function have been demonstrated using bodily fluid volume and pressure measurements. Oedema (swelling) reduction can be measured by limb volumetry, a method of suspending a limb in water to determine the amount of water displaced. Compression stockings putting pressure on the lower leg are able to increase venous blood flow velocity while patients are lying down. Compression stockings are also able to prevent leg swelling after prolonged sitting and standing. In the upright position, specific pressure (>50 mmHg) is needed for intermittent (irregular) closing of abnormal veins and for pressure reduction during walking.

40,32710511,"The presence of chronic heart failure (CHF) results in a significant risk of leg oedema. Medical compression (MC) treatment is one of the basic methods of leg oedema elimination in patients with chronic venous disease and lymphedema, but it is not routinely considered in subjects with CHF-related swelling. In the study, an overview of the current knowledge related to the benefits and risk of using MC in the supportive treatment of leg oedema in CHF patients is presented. The available studies dedicated the comprehensive management of leg swelling using MC in CHF patients published in the English language literature till December 2019 were evaluated in term of the treatment efficacy and safety. In studies performed on CHF populations, manual lymphatic drainage, MC stocking, multilayer bandaged, as well as intermittent pneumatic compression or electric calf stimulations were used. The current evidence is based on non-randomized studies, small study cohorts, as well as very heterogenous populations. The use of the intermittent pneumatic compression in CHF patients significantly increases the right auricular pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressures as well as decreases systemic vascular resistance in most patients without the clinical worsening. The transient and rapid increase in the human atrial natriuretic peptide, after an application of the MC stocking in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II patients was observed without clinical exacerbation. An application of the multilayer bandages in NYHA classes III and IV patients lead a significant increase in the right arterial pressure and lead to transient deterioration of the right and the left ventricular functions. In the manual lymphatic drainage study, aside from expected leg circumference reduction, no clinical worsening was observed. In a pilot study performed in a small cohort of CHF patients, electrical calf stimulation use resulted in a reduction in the lean mass of the legs without cardiac function worsening. The use of local leg compression can be considered stable CHF patients without decompensated heart function for both CHF-related oedema treatment and for treatment of the concomitant diseases leading to leg swelling occurrence. The use of MC in more severe classes of CHF (NYHA III and IV) should be the subject of future clinical studies to select the safest and most efficient compression method as well as to select the patients who benefit most from this kind of treatment.","Long-lasting or chronic heart failure (CHF) results in a significant risk of leg oedema. Leg oedema is swelling due to excess fluid accumulation in the body.

However, it is not routinely considered in subjects with CHF-related swelling. This study is an overview of evidence related to the benefits and risk of using MC in the treatment of leg oedema in CHF patients. This paper reviews research published in English up until December 2019. The reviewed paper focused on the management of leg swelling through the use of MC within CHF patients. All reviewed papers were evaluated for treatment efficacy and safety. In studies of CHF populations, several treatment options were used. These options include manual lymphatic drainage, MC stocking, multilayer bandaged, and electric calf stimulations. The current evidence is based on non-randomized studies, small study cohorts, as well as very diverse populations. Intermittent pneumatic compression is a treatment that uses a device that squeezes fluids from an infected area. The treatment in CHF patients significantly increased pressure in the lungs and heart. The treatment decreased systemic vascular resistance, or the resistance that must be overcome to push blood through veins, in most patients without the disease worsening. Human atrial natriuretic peptide, a substance in the body that reduces fluid volume, increased in patients without clinical exacerbation or pain. Use of multilayer bandages in patients significantly increased the right arterial (section of the heart) pressure. Use of multilayer bandages also lead to deterioration of heart chamber function. In the manual lymphatic drainage study, aside from reducing leg size, no clinical worsening was observed. In a trial study performed in a small cohort of CHF patients, electrical calf stimulation resulted in reduced lean mass of the legs without cardiac function worsening. The use of local leg compression within CHF patients could be considered. Use of local leg compression did not decompensate heart function in patients with either CHF-related oedema or concomitant (accompanying) diseases leading to leg swelling. The use of MC in more severe classes of CHF should be further studied to select the safest and most efficient compression method. The patients who would benefit most from MC treatment should also be identified.",
41,33536341,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 genes and affects multiple organs, including kidney, lung, and brain. In the kidney, TSC presents with the enlargement of benign tumors (angiomyolipomata) and cysts, which eventually leads to kidney failure. The factors promoting cyst formation and tumor growth in TSC are incompletely understood. Here, we report that mice with principal cell-specific inactivation of Tsc1 develop numerous cortical cysts, which are overwhelmingly composed of hyperproliferating A-intercalated (A-IC) cells. RNA sequencing and confirmatory expression studies demonstrated robust expression of Forkhead Transcription Factor 1 (Foxi1) and its downstream targets, apical H+-ATPase and cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase 2 (CAII), in cyst epithelia in Tsc1 knockout (KO) mice but not in Pkd1 mutant mice. In addition, the electrogenic 2Cl-/H+ exchanger (CLC-5) is significantly up-regulated and shows remarkable colocalization with H+-ATPase on the apical membrane of cyst epithelia in Tsc1 KO mice. Deletion of Foxi1, which is vital to intercalated cells viability and H+-ATPase expression, completely abrogated the cyst burden in Tsc1 KO mice, as indicated by MRI images and histological analysis in kidneys of Foxi1/Tsc1 double-knockout (dKO) mice. Deletion of CAII, which is critical to H+-ATPase activation, caused significant reduction in cyst burden and increased life expectancy in CAII/Tsc1 dKO mice vs. Tsc1 KO mice. We propose that intercalated cells and their acid/base/electrolyte transport machinery (H+-ATPase/CAII/CLC-5) are critical to cystogenesis, and their inhibition or inactivation is associated with significant protection against cyst generation and/or enlargement in TSC.","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare disease that leads to noncancerous (benign) tumors forming in the body. TSC is caused by changes in two specific genes (TSC1 or TSC2) and affects multiple organs, including the kidney, lung, and brain. In the kidney, TSC can cause benign tumors and cysts (fluid swellings) to grow, which eventually leads to kidney failure. The factors promoting cyst formation and tumor growth in TSC are not completely understood. In this study, researchers report that mice with inactivation (turning off) of specific cells develop many cysts in the kidney. Past studies with mice show an increase of the Forkhead Transcription Factor 1 (Foxi1) gene that impacts cell processing in cyst epithelia cells, which are important cells for kidney function. Also, some gene processing is increased and work together with proton pumps called H+-ATPase, which regulate functions such as nutrient intake and regulating acids between cells, on the lining of epithelial cysts cells in mice. Deletion of the Foxi1 gene, which is key to the survival of cells and H+-ATPase processing, overrides the cyst burden in Tsc1 mice. Deletion of the enzyme CAII causes major decreases in cyst burden and increased life expectancy in mice without CAII and Tsc1 versus mice without just Tsc1. Researchers suggest that epithelial cells in the kidneys and their transport mechanisms are important to the formation of many cysts, and slowing or stopping them is associated with significant protection against cyst development and/or enlargement in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).",
36,33991399,"The primary goals of medical expulsive therapy are to increase the rate of stone expulsion along the ureter to avoid ureteral obstruction and reduce ureteral colic and thus avoid the need for surgical and more invasive interventions. This review focussed on the findings from in vivo and in vitro animal and human studies that have investigated the pharmacological mechanisms controlling ureteral motility and their translation to current and potentially new clinically used drugs for increasing the rate of stone expulsion along the ureter. The complicated contractility profile of the ureter, which alters with age, tissue segment region, orientation and species contributes to the difficulty of interpreting studies on ureteral pharmacology, which translates to the complexity of discovering ideal drug targets for medical expulsive therapy. Nevertheless, the current drug classes clinically used for patients with stone lodgement include α1 -adrenoceptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers and NSAIDS, whilst there are promising targets for drug development that require further clinical investigations including the phosphodiesterase type 5 enzyme, β-adrenoceptors and 5-HT receptors.","Medical expulsive therapy uses medication to relax certain muscles in the body to release small kidney stones.

How the ureter tube, that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder, is able to contract changes over time and makes interpreting results from studies on drugs difficult and, therefore, hard to find the best drugs for medical explusive therapy. However, the current types of drugs used for patients with stones include α1 -adrenoceptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers, that can increase the size of the urinary tube to allow stones to pass, as well as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for pain. There are promising drugs under development for study.",
55,32309576,"Membrane Lipid Replacement is the use of functional oral supplements containing cell membrane glycerolphospholipids and antioxidants to safely replace damaged membrane lipids that accumulate during aging and in various chronic and acute diseases.

42,33827674,"Background: The oncogenic role of histone mutations is one of the most relevant discovery in cancer epigenetics. Recurrent mutations targeting histone genes have been described in pediatric brain tumors, chondroblastoma, giant cell tumor of bone and other tumor types. The demonstration that mutant histones can be oncogenic and drive the tumorigenesis in pediatric tumors, led to the coining of the term ""oncohistones."" The first identified histone mutations were localized at or near residues normally targeted by post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the histone N-terminal tails and suggested a possible interference with histone PTMs regulation and reading. Main body: In this review, we describe the peculiar organization of the multiple genes that encode histone proteins, and the latter advances in both the identification and the biological role of histone mutations in cancer. Recent works show that recurrent somatic mutations target both N-terminal tails and globular histone fold domain in diverse tumor types. Oncohistones are often dominant-negative and occur at higher frequencies in tumors affecting children and adolescents. Notably, in many cases the mutations target selectively only some of the genes coding the same histone protein and are frequently associated with specific tumor types or, as documented for histone variant H3.3 in pediatric glioma, with peculiar tumors arising from specific anatomic locations. Conclusion: The overview of the most recent advances suggests that the oncogenic potential of histone mutations can be exerted, together with the alteration of histone PTMs, through the destabilization of nucleosome and DNA-nucleosome interactions, as well as through the disruption of higher-order chromatin structure. However, further studies are necessary to fully elucidate the mechanism of action of oncohistones, as well as to evaluate their possible application to cancer classification, prognosis and to the identification of new therapies.","The cancer or tumor causing role of changes to histone proteins is one of the most important discoveries in cancer research. Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Recurring mutations (changes) that target histone genes are described in brain tumors in children, in a rare type of noncancerous bone tumor that begins in cartilage chondroblastoma (noncancerous bone tumors in cartilage), and in giant tumors of bones and other types of tumors. The finding that mutant histones can cause cancer and tumors, also called oncogenic, and drive development of tumors in children lead to the new term ""onchohistones"". In this review, researchers describe the organization of the multiple genes that build histone proteins and the role of histone mutations in cancer. Recent works show that recurring mutations during pregnancy target both N-terminal (nitrogen-containing) tails that are on histones and interact with DNA and the central part of the histone that folds in different types of tumors. Oncohistones (the mutant histones that can cause tumors) often occur more in tumors affecting children and adolescents. Notably, in many cases, the mutations target only some of the genes that interact with histone proteins and are frequently associated with specific tumor types or with tumors that come from specific locations. In conclusion, the overview of recent advances suggests that it's possible histones mutation can form cancer or tumors. However, further studies are necessary to fully describe the process of histone proteins that may cause cancer (oncohistones), as well as to evaluate how they might influence cancer classification, the course of the disease, and the identification of new treatments.",
12,24215414,"Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and, in the latter part of the 20th century, reached epidemic proportions. Asthma is generally believed to result from gene-environment interactions. There is consensus that a 'window of opportunity' exists during pregnancy and early in life when environmental factors may influence its development. We review multiple environmental, biologic and sociologic factors that may be important in the development of asthma. Meta-analyses of studies have demonstrated that multifaceted interventions are required in order to develop asthma prevention. Multifaceted allergen reduction studies have shown clinical benefits. Asthma represents a dysfunctional interaction with our genes and the environment to which they are exposed, especially in fetal and early infant life. The increasing prevalence of asthma also may be an indication of increased population risk for the development of other chronic non-communicable autoimmune diseases. This review will focus on the factors which may be important in the primary prevention of asthma. Better understanding of the complex gene-environment interactions involved in the development of asthma will provide insight into personalized interventions for asthma prevention.","Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and, in the latter part of the 20th century, asthma became very widespread. Asthma is generally believed to result from gene-environment interactions, which is when two different genes respond to something in the environment in different ways. There is agreement that there are certain times during pregnancy and early in a child's life when environmental factors (such as food, pollutants, temperature) may shape asthma's development. Researchers reviewed multiple environmental, biologic (such as brain chemistry, genes, nutrition, gender, and hormone levels) and sociologic (such as education and socioeconomic) factors that may be important in the development of asthma. Other studies show that multiple steps and actions are required to prevent asthma. Studies that focus on reducing or avoiding allergens (any substance that causes an allergic reaction) are beneficial. Asthma represents an error in how our genes and the environment interact, especially during pregnancy and early infant life. The increase in the number of asthma cases may also signal an increased risk in the general population for the development of other chronic autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks healthy cells.

21,18656819,"Hiatus hernia refers to conditions in which elements of the abdominal cavity, most commonly the stomach, herniate through the oesophageal hiatus into the mediastinum. With the most common type (type I or sliding hiatus hernia) this is associated with laxity of the phrenooesophageal membrane and the gastric cardia herniates. Sliding hiatus hernia is readily diagnosed by barium swallow radiography, endoscopy, or manometry when greater than 2 cm in axial span. However, the mobility of the oesophagogastric junction precludes the reliable detection of more subtle disruption by endoscopy or radiography. Detecting lesser degrees of axial separation between the lower oesophageal sphincter and crural diaphragm can only be reliably accomplished with high-resolution manometry, a technique that permits real time localization of these oesophagogastric junction components without swallow or distention related artefact.","Hiatus hernia refers to when the upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm into the chest. The most common type (type 1 or sliding hiatus hernia), looseness of the ligament that attaches the esophagus to the diaphragm, causes the part of the stomach that is closest to the esophagus to push up. Sliding hiatus hernia is easily diagnosed by a swallowing test during x-ray, a flexible tube with a light and camera attached, or an esophagus test when more than 2 cm along an axis. However, the movement of the junction between the esophagus and stomach doesn't allow for dependable detection of smaller abnormalities using a flexible tube with a light and camera attached or x-ray. Detecting lesser separation between the esophagus and the diaphragm can only be done reliably with a high-resolution esophagus test, which allows a real time location of the parts of the junction between the esophagus and stomach without misrepresentation due to movement.",
53,31151228,"Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a form of intermittent fasting that involves having a longer daily fasting period. Preliminary studies report that TRF improves cardiometabolic health in rodents and humans. Here, we performed the first study to determine how TRF affects gene expression, circulating hormones, and diurnal patterns in cardiometabolic risk factors in humans. Eleven overweight adults participated in a 4-day randomized crossover study where they ate between 8 am and 2 pm (early TRF (eTRF)) and between 8 am and 8 pm (control schedule). Participants underwent continuous glucose monitoring, and blood was drawn to assess cardiometabolic risk factors, hormones, and gene expression in whole blood cells. Relative to the control schedule, eTRF decreased mean 24-hour glucose levels by 4 ± 1 mg/dl (p = 0.0003) and glycemic excursions by 12 ± 3 mg/dl (p = 0.001). In the morning before breakfast, eTRF increased ketones, cholesterol, and the expression of the stress response and aging gene SIRT1 and the autophagy gene LC3A (all p < 0.04), while in the evening, it tended to increase brain-derived neurotropic factor (BNDF; p = 0.10) and also increased the expression of MTOR (p = 0.007), a major nutrient-sensing protein that regulates cell growth. eTRF also altered the diurnal patterns in cortisol and the expression of several circadian clock genes (p < 0.05). eTRF improves 24-hour glucose levels, alters lipid metabolism and circadian clock gene expression, and may also increase autophagy and have anti-aging effects in humans.","Intermittent fasting is a type of eating schedule where a person doesn't eat any calories for a period of time.

In this study, researchers perform the first study to determine how time-restricted feeding affects how information from genes are used, how circulating hormones that travel in blood and attach to cells can change the cell function, and how daily patterns in the heart and metabolism can be risk factors in humans. Eleven overweight adults participated in a 4-day study where they ate between 8 am and 2 pm (early time-restricted feeding) and between 8 am and 8 pm (control group for comparison). Participants have their sugar continuously monitored, and blood is drawn to assess risk factors to the heart and metabolism, hormones, and gene development in blood cells. Relative to the comparison group's schedule, early time-restricted feeding decreased the average 24-hour sugar levels and changes in blood sugar. In the morning before breakfast, early time-restricted feeding increased ketones (substances that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar), cholesterol, and the activity of the stress response and aging gene SIRT1 and the gene LC3A that cleans out damaged cells. While in the evening, time-restricted feeding tends to increase brain-derived neurotropic factor, which is a helpful protein in the spinal cord and brain, and also increases the expansion of the MTOR gene, a major nutrient-sensing protein that regulates cell growth. Early time-restricted feeding changes daily patterns in the cortisol stress hormone and use of several genes. Early time-restricted feeding improves 24 hour blood sugar levels, changes how fats are broken down, and how gene functions are used.

15,27151921,"We recently described a novel thiazide-sensitive electroneutral NaCl transport mechanism resulting from the parallel operation of the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger pendrin and the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) in β-intercalated cells of the collecting duct. Although a role for pendrin in maintaining Na+ balance, intravascular volume, and BP is well supported, there is no in vivo evidence for the role of NDCBE in maintaining Na+ balance. Here, we show that deletion of NDCBE in mice caused only subtle perturbations of Na+ homeostasis and provide evidence that the Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC) compensated for the inactivation of NDCBE. To unmask the role of NDCBE, we generated Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout (dKO) mice. On a normal salt diet, dKO and single-knockout mice exhibited similar activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, whereas only dKO mice displayed a lower blood K+ concentration. Furthermore, dKO mice displayed upregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the Ca2+-activated K+ channel BKCa. During NaCl depletion, only dKO mice developed marked intravascular volume contraction, despite dramatically increased renin activity. Notably, the increase in aldosterone levels expected on NaCl depletion was attenuated in dKO mice, and single-knockout and dKO mice had similar blood K+ concentrations under this condition. In conclusion, NDCBE is necessary for maintaining sodium balance and intravascular volume during salt depletion or NCC inactivation in mice. Furthermore, NDCBE has an important role in the prevention of hypokalemia. Because NCC and NDCBE are both thiazide targets, the combined inhibition of NCC and the NDCBE/pendrin system may explain thiazide-induced hypokalemia in some patients.","Past studies describe a new process to transport and reabsorb sodium and chloride ions (atoms or molecules that carry electrical charges) from one side of the cell to the other. One is called the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) that is a protein that exchanges Na+ (sodium) from outside the cell for Cl- (chloride) that is in the cell. There is no lab or test tube experiments that show evidence for the role of Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE) in maintaining a sodium balance. In this present study, researchers show that reducing Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger in mice causes only minor disruptions of sodium homeostasis (processes used by the body to maintain a normal sodium concentration in the fluid outside the cells). Researchers provide evidence that the Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC) (the carrier protein that helps reabsorb sodium and chloride ions from tube fluid into the cells) compensated for the lack of action of the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger. To understand the role of Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger, researchers generated an experiment with Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice, mice without NCC or NDCBE. On a normal diet, Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout and single-knockout mice showed similar activation of the hormone system that helps regulate blood pressure, electrolytes, and some heart-related function; however, only Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice showed lower potassium in the blood. Also, Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice showed an increase in the surface sodium channels (ENaC) and the potassium channel Ca2+-activated K+ channels BKCa. When sodium-chloride is depleted, only Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice developed altered blood volume contraction, despite increased kidney activity. Notably, the increase in aldosterone (a hormone that regulates sodium and potassium levels) expected from the sodium-chloride loss was weakened in Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice. Single knock-out and Ndcbe/Ncc double-knockout mice had similar blood potassium concentrations when this occurred. In conclusion, the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger is necessary for maintaining sodium balance and volume of blood when salt is reduced or when Na+/Cl- cotransporter Is turned off in mice. Furthermore, Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger has an important role in preventing hypokalemia (low levels of potassium). Because Na+/Cl- cotransporter and Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger are both targets of thiazide targets (which reduces sodium reabsorption), the combined slowing of Na+/Cl- cotransporter and the Na+-driven Cl-/2HCO3- exchanger/pendrin system (a multifaceted transporter that plays important roles in various functions of the kidney) may explain thiazide generated hypokalemia in some patients.",

46,30825185,"Background and purpose: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal autosomal recessive genetic disease that originates from the defective function of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a cAMP-dependent anion channel involved in fluid transport across epithelium. Because small synthetic transmembrane anion transporters (anionophores) can replace the biological anion transport mechanisms, independent of genetic mutations in the CFTR, such anionophores are candidates as new potential treatments for CF. Experimental approach: In order to assess their effects on cell physiology, we have analysed the transport properties of five anionophore compounds, three prodigiosines and two tambjamines. Chloride efflux was measured in large uni-lamellar vesicles and in HEK293 cells with chloride-sensitive electrodes. Iodide influx was evaluated in FRT cells transfected with iodide-sensitive YFP. Transport of bicarbonate was assessed by changes of pH after a NH4 + pre-pulse using the BCECF fluorescent probe. Assays were also carried out in FRT cells permanently transfected with wild type and mutant human CFTR. Key results: All studied compounds are capable of transporting halides and bicarbonate across the cell membrane, with a higher transport capacity at acidic pH. Interestingly, the presence of these anionophores did not interfere with the activation of CFTR and did not modify the action of lumacaftor (a CFTR corrector) or ivacaftor (a CFTR potentiator). Conclusion and implications: These anionophores, at low concentrations, transported chloride and bicarbonate across cell membranes, without affecting CFTR function. They therefore provide promising starting points for the development of novel treatments for CF.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a deadly disease inherited from both parents that is caused when the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein does not work correctly, a channel involved with movement of ions (charged atoms) and fluids in epithelial cells (cells that cover the outer surface of the internal organs). Anionophores, which are small human-made substances that move negative ions (anions) across membranes, can replace biological anion movement regardless of gene changes in the CFTR and are possible treatments for CF. We looked at the movement properties of five anionophore substances. We measured the flow of chloride out of the cell. We measured the flow of iodide into the cell. We measured the movement of bicarbonate (compound). We saw that all five compounds are able to move halides and bicarbonate (compounds) across the cell membrane, with more moved in acidic conditions. Anionophores did not change CFTR activation and did not change the effects of a lumacaftor (corrector that helps the changed protein to move to the cell surface) or ivacaftor (potentiator that holds the gate to the channel open so chloride can flow through the cell membrane). We conclude that anionophores, at low concentrations, moved chloride and bicarbonate (compounds) across cell membranes, without changing CFTR function. New CF treatments could be developed starting from anionophores.",

42,31286445,"cHistone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are essential for regulating chromatin and maintaining gene expression throughout cell differentiation. Despite the deep level of understanding of immunophenotypic differentiation pathways in hematopoietic cells, few studies have investigated global levels of histone PTMs required for differentiation and maintenance of these distinct cell types. Here, we describe an approach to couple fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with targeted mass spectrometry to define global ""epi-proteomic"" signatures for primary leukocytes. FACS was used to sort closely and distantly related leukocytes from normal human peripheral blood for quantitation of histone PTMs with a multiple reaction monitoring LC-MS/MS method measuring histone PTMs on histones H3 and H4. We validate cell sorting directly into H2SO4 for immediate histone extraction to decrease time and number of steps after FACS to analyze histone PTMs. Relative histone PTM levels vary in T cells across healthy donors, and the majority of PTMs remain stable up to 2 days following initial blood draw. Large differences in the levels of histone PTMs are observed across the mature lymphoid and myeloid lineages, as well as between different types within the same lineage, though no differences are observed in closely related T cell subtypes. The results show a streamlined approach for quantifying global changes in histone PTMs in cell types separated by FACS that is poised for clinical deployment.","Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around.

The transferred embryos were divided into two groups - early (cultivation 48 and 72 hrs) and prolonged cultivation (PC 96 and 120 hrs). The answer here, therefore, is a multinomial variable with four levels. For that reason the data was analysed through a multinomial logistic model vs. multinomial distribution of a mistake and generalised logistic link function. Results: The hCG level grows exponentially in the course of the 9th to 17th day after an embryo transfer (ET). The probability of one child delivery after the transfer of one embryo overdue after prolonged cultivation (96 or 120 hrs) grows with the average and above-average hCG values on the day of the draw. The hCG value was 678 (564-815) IU/l1 on the 14th day after ET in pregnancy ended in delivery, 321 (216-477) IU/l on average in abortion, 82 (51-132) IU/l in biochemical pregnancy and 1070 (737-1554) IU/l in multiple pregnancy. The probability of multiple pregnancy increased with hCG values greatly above the average and on the other hand, below-average values indicated abortion or biochemical pregnancy. The patients age was not proven to be of significant influence, the hCG level slightly decreased with higher age. On the contrary, an increasing frequency of abortions depending on the increasing age of the mother was once again confirmed. Conclusion: The measured hCG values are considerably different depending on the pregnancy result, which is why this value is considered a quality predictive factor of the pregnancy result.","This study examined patients after embryo transfer. This study aimed to predict the influence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG - a pregnancy hormone) levels on the probability of finishing pregnancy with delivery. This study evaluated 490 patients pregnant after IVF + ET (lab-grown egg transfer) treatment. The influence of other factors on finishing pregnancy with delivery or loss was determined. These factors included age (patients 20-50), number of transferred embryos (one, two and more) and the length of cultivation. This study also aimed to predict if multiple pregnancy was related to hCG value. The transferred embryos were divided into two groups - early (cultivation 48 and 72 hrs) and prolonged cultivation (PC 96 and 120 hrs). Because of this, the data was evaluated in several levels. The data was analyzed through several statistical algorithms. The hCG level grew more and more rapidly in the course of the 9th to 17th day after an embryo transfer (ET). Probability of one child delivery after the transfer of one embryo overdue after prolonged cultivation grows with increased hCG values on the day of the draw. The hCG value determined what type of pregnancy would occur. The probability of multiple pregnancy increased with hCG values above the average. However, below-average hCG values indicated abortion or biochemical pregnancy. Patients age was not proven to be of significant influence. The hCG level slightly decreased with higher age. An increase in frequency of abortions correlating (linking) to increased age of the mother was once again confirmed. The measured hCG values are considerably different depending on the pregnancy result. Because of this, hCG value is considered a quality predictive factor of the pregnancy result.",

The flexible panendoscope was used 211 times (87.2%) to manage these foreign bodies, while the rigid esophagoscope was used 12 times (5.0%). Two hundred thirty-nine foreign bodies (98.8%) were successfully managed endoscopically. The surgery rate was 0.4%. There was no morbidity or mortality. Twenty-five percent of the cases were done under general endotracheal anesthesia. Coins in the esophagus are removed promptly if in the cervical or mid esophagus, and within 12 hours if in the distal esophagus. Once in the stomach, they will usually pass without difficulty. Meat impaction resulting in an obstructed esophagus is an urgent problem and the bolus should be removed within hours. Sharp and pointed foreign bodies can be very difficult to manage. Dry runs with a reproduction of the foreign body are essential to successful removal. Button batteries lodged in the esophagus represent an emergency and should be removed without delay.

24,19635161,"Background: Several medications commonly used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been designated ""potentially inappropriate"" for use in patients aged > or =65 years because their risks may outweigh their potential benefits. The actual extent of use of these agents in clinical practice is unknown, however. Methods: Using a database with information from encounters with general practitioners (GP) in Germany, we identified all patients, aged > or =65 years, with any GP office visits or dispensed prescriptions with a diagnosis of GAD (ICD-10 diagnosis code F41.1) between 10/1/2003 and 9/30/2004 (""GAD patients""). Among GAD-related medications (including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, hydroxyzine, buspirone, pregabalin, and trifluoperazine), long-acting benzodiazepines, selected short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high dosages, selected TCAs, and hydroxyzine were designated ""potentially inappropriate"" for use in patients aged > or = 65 years, based on published criteria. Results: A total of 975 elderly patients with GAD were identified. Mean age was 75 years, and 72% were women; 29% had diagnoses of comorbid depression. Forty percent of study subjects received potentially inappropriate agents - most commonly, bromazepam (10% of all subjects), diazepam (9%), doxepin (7%), amitriptyline (5%), and lorazepam (5%). Twenty-three percent of study subjects received long-acting benzodiazepines, 10% received short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high doses, and 12% received TCAs designated as potentially inappropriate. Conclusion: GPs in Germany often prescribe medications that have been designated as potentially inappropriate to their elderly patients with GAD - especially those with comorbid depressive disorders.

This lack of evidence prompts an issue of debate among practitioners over the type of carbohydrate and its percent distribution throughout the day. The best indicators at this time are the results of self-monitoring of blood glucose, ketone testing, food records, and weight gain.

25,34556486,"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of antiviral antibody therapies and blood products for the treatment of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). Design: Living systematic review and network meta-analysis, with pairwise meta-analysis for outcomes with insufficient data. Data sources: WHO covid-19 database, a comprehensive multilingual source of global covid-19 literature, and six Chinese databases (up to 21 July 2021). Study selection: Trials randomising people with suspected, probable, or confirmed covid-19 to antiviral antibody therapies, blood products, or standard care or placebo. Paired reviewers determined eligibility of trials independently and in duplicate. Methods: After duplicate data abstraction, we performed random effects bayesian meta-analysis, including network meta-analysis for outcomes with sufficient data. We assessed risk of bias using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach. We meta-analysed interventions with ≥100 patients randomised or ≥20 events per treatment arm. Results: As of 21 July 2021, we identified 47 trials evaluating convalescent plasma (21 trials), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (5 trials), umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (5 trials), bamlanivimab (4 trials), casirivimab-imdevimab (4 trials), bamlanivimab-etesevimab (2 trials), control plasma (2 trials), peripheral blood non-haematopoietic enriched stem cells (2 trials), sotrovimab (1 trial), anti-SARS-CoV-2 IVIg (1 trial), therapeutic plasma exchange (1 trial), XAV-19 polyclonal antibody (1 trial), CT-P59 monoclonal antibody (1 trial) and INM005 polyclonal antibody (1 trial) for the treatment of covid-19. Patients with non-severe disease randomised to antiviral monoclonal antibodies had lower risk of hospitalisation than those who received placebo: casirivimab-imdevimab (odds ratio (OR) 0.29 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.47); risk difference (RD) -4.2%; moderate certainty), bamlanivimab (OR 0.24 (0.06 to 0.86); RD -4.1%; low certainty), bamlanivimab-etesevimab (OR 0.31 (0.11 to 0.81); RD -3.8%; low certainty), and sotrovimab (OR 0.17 (0.04 to 0.57); RD -4.8%; low certainty). They did not have an important impact on any other outcome. There was no notable difference between monoclonal antibodies. No other intervention had any meaningful effect on any outcome in patients with non-severe covid-19. No intervention, including antiviral antibodies, had an important impact on any outcome in patients with severe or critical covid-19, except casirivimab-imdevimab, which may reduce mortality in patients who are seronegative. Conclusion: In patients with non-severe covid-19, casirivimab-imdevimab probably reduces hospitalisation; bamlanivimab-etesevimab, bamlanivimab, and sotrovimab may reduce hospitalisation. Convalescent plasma, IVIg, and other antibody and cellular interventions may not confer any meaningful benefit.","The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance and safety of antiviral antibody therapies that help the body fight off or prevent a virus and blood products used to treat COVID-19. Published data from other studies is summarized on an ongoing basis and compares data from different medicines, including an analysis to fill in the gaps for studies that have limited data. The data sources for this summary are the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 and six Chinese databases that store data up to July 21, 2021. In clinical trials, people with suspected COVID-19 (person has symptoms and/or exposure to covid but is not tested), probable COVID-19 (person who has tested positive with other tests but not confirmatory test), or confirmed COVID-19 are randomly put into different treatment groups or a placebo, where they receive something that looks like a drug but is not active. Two reviewers determine if the different clinical studies will be included in the summary. After data are collected from the clinical studies, the data are analyzed. The confidence that the results in the studies are accurate is graded using an established process. Clinical trials with 100 or more patients or 20 or more events per treatment type are analyzed. As of July 21st 2021, 47 trials that evaluated different blood products and medicines, including monoclonal antibodies, are found. Patients with non-severe disease who receive antiviral monoclonal antibodies (medicines that may block the virus from attaching to human cells) have lower risk of being hospitalized than those who received placebo. Antiviral monoclonal antibodies did not have an important impact on any other outcome. There is no major difference between monoclonal antibodies. No other treatment intervention is found to have any meaningful effect on any outcome in patients with non-severe COVID-19. No intervention, including antiviral antibodies, has an important impact on any outcome in patients with severe or critical COVID-19, except casirivimab-imdevimab, which may reduce death in patients who had a negative blood test. In conclusion, patients with non-severe COVID-19, the drug casirivimab-imdevimab probably reduces hospital stays; bamlanivimab-etesevimab, bamlanivimab, and sotrovimab may reduce hospitalization.

28,34549987,"Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in patients with COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation. It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Remarkablely, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation. The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HUB1-CoV and influenza virus H1N1 did not activate endothelial cells. These findings are well consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a worldwide challenge for health-care systems. The leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19 is hypoxic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date, pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) have been largely overlooked as a therapeutic target in COVID-19, yet emerging evidence suggests that these cells contribute to the initiation and propagation of ARDS by altering vessel barrier integrity, promoting a pro-coagulative state, inducing vascular inflammation and mediating inflammatory cell infiltration. Therefore, a better mechanistic understanding of the vasculature is of utmost importance. In this study, we screened the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells and found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Our results provide insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients.","Recent scientific reports suggest that increased endothelial activation plays a key role in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure seen within patients of COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease). Endothelial cells line our organs within our body, especially blood vessels. When these cells become activated, they encourage inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) and blood clotting or scabbing. However, how COVID-19 causes this endothelial cell activation is unclear. In this study, COVID-19 virus proteins (small molecules within the virus that help it function) were analyzed. The goal of analyzing the proteins was to determine how they might activate endothelial cells. This study found a specific protein of COVID-19 that highly activated endothelial cells through two specific bodily pathways. Secondly, the authors identified a prescription medication, known as Simvastatin, that can reduce the identified endothelial activation. The authors also noted that the identified protein only caused endothelial activation in COVID-19 illness. This protein in other illnesses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HUB1-CoV and influenza virus H1N1, did not activate endothelial cells. These scientific findings match with results from clinical research (research within patients). Clinical research has shown broad endothelial cell inflammation and organ injury within COVID-19 patients. The authors concluded this paper increases current knowledge surrounding how COVID-19 impacts blood vessels and blood flow within patients. Additionally, this paper suggested simvastatin may help prevent damage and improve overall health within COVID-19 patients. COVID-19, caused by a coronavirus, is a worldwide challenge for health-care. The leading cause of death in those with COVID-19 is lack of oxygen in the blood from a breathing-related illness. To date, cells that line the lungs and its blood vessels have been overlooked as a therapy target in COVID-19, yet new evidence suggests these cells contribute to the start and spread of breathing-related illnesses by changing blood vessel structures, promoting clotting, causing inflammation, and influencing inflammatory cell reactions. Therefore, a better understanding of the blood vessels Is of great importance. In this study, we tested COVID-19 virus proteins that activate these blood-vessel lining cells and found that viral proteins activate these cells through phosphate-related pathways. Also, by testing a natural microorganism library with 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was found to be a powerful blocker of the viral-caused lining cell activation. Our results give insights on the viral-caused blood- and blood vessel-related diseases, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved fat-lowering drug, may help prevent these diseases and improve outcomes for COVID-19 patients.",
15,27068441,"STE20 (Sterile 20)/SPS-1 related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress-response kinase-1 (OSR1) activate the renal cation cotransporters Na(+) -K(+) -2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC2) and Na(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter (NCC) via phosphorylation. Knockout mouse models suggest that OSR1 mainly activates NKCC2, while SPAK mainly activates NCC, with possible cross-compensation. We tested the hypothesis that disrupting both kinases causes severe polyuria and salt-wasting by generating SPAK/OSR1 double knockout (DKO) mice. DKO mice displayed lower systolic blood pressure compared with SPAK knockout (SPAK-KO) mice, but displayed no severe phenotype even after dietary salt restriction. Phosphorylation of NKCC2 at SPAK/OSR1-dependent sites was lower than in SPAK-KO mice, but still significantly greater than in wild type mice. In the renal medulla, there was significant phosphorylation of NKCC2 at SPAK/OSR1-dependent sites despite a complete absence of SPAK and OSR1, suggesting the existence of an alternative activating kinase. The distal convoluted tubule has been proposed to sense plasma [K(+) ], with NCC activation serving as the primary effector pathway that modulates K(+) secretion, by metering sodium delivery to the collecting duct. Abundance of phosphorylated NCC (pNCC) is dramatically lower in SPAK-KO mice than in wild type mice, and the additional disruption of OSR1 further reduced pNCC. SPAK-KO and kidney-specific OSR1 single knockout mice maintained plasma [K(+) ] following dietary potassium restriction, but DKO mice developed severe hypokalaemia. Unlike mice lacking SPAK or OSR1 alone, DKO mice displayed an inability to phosphorylate NCC under these conditions. These data suggest that SPAK and OSR1 are essential components of the effector pathway that maintains plasma [K(+) ].","Two protein enzymes called STE20 (Sterile 20)/SPS-1 related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress-response kinase-1 (OSR1) activate the kidney-related cotransporters (carrier proteins that carry two different ions or other species from one side of the cell to the other) Na(+) -K(+) -2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC2) and Na(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter (NCC). Knockout mouse models (experiments with mice that lack a specific gene) suggest that OSR1 mainly activates NKCC2, while SPAK mainly activates NCC, and sometimes compensate for one another. Researchers tested the idea that disrupting both enzymes causes severe polyuria (passing unusually large amounts of urine) and salt-wasting by producing SPAK/OSR1 double knockout (DKO) mice - mice without SPAK or OSR1. DKO mice showed lower systolic blood pressure (the top number of blood pressure that indicates how much pressure the blood is exerting against artery walls when the heart beats) compared to SPAK knockout (SPAK-KO) mice, but showed no severe phenotype (observable traits or characteristics) even after salt restriction in food. Phosphorylation (a process of adding a phosphate group, a group of atoms that have different roles and make up DNA and RNA, to a molecule to prepare it to change or do work) of NKCC2 at SPAK/OSR1-dependent sites was lower than in SPAK-KO mice (mice without SPAK), but still much greater than in wild-type or normal mice. In the innermost part of the kidney called the medulla, there was significant phosphorylation of NKCC2 at SPAK/OSR1-dependent sites despite a complete absence of SPAK and OSR1, which suggests the existence of another activating kinase enzyme. The distal convoluted tubule (a part within the kidney that connects to the collecting duct system that refines salt and water reabsorption) has been suggested to sense blood potassium by monitoring sodium delivery to the collecting duct. A lot of phosphorylated Na(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter (pNCC) is dramatically lowered in SPAK-KO mice than in wild type mice, and the additional disruption of OSR1 further reduced pNCC. SPAK-KO and kidney-specific OSR1 single knockout mice (mice without OSR1 only in the kidney) maintained potassium in the blood following restrictions of potassium in food, but DKO mice developed severe hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood). Unlike mice lacking SPAK or OSR1 alone, SPAK/OSR1 double knockout (DKO) mice showed an inability to phosphorylate NCC under these conditions. These data suggest that STE20 (Sterile 20)/SPS-1 related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress-response kinase-1 (OSR1) are essential components of the pathway that maintains potassium in the blood.",
47,34213743,"Purpose: The study aimed to define the clinical, biochemical and genetic features of adult patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis and/or bone fragility and low serum alkaline phosphatase (sALP). Methods: Twenty-two patients with at least two sALP values below the reference range were retrospectively enrolled after exclusion of secondary causes. Data about clinical features, mineral and bone markers, serum pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA), lumbar and femur bone densitometry, and column X-ray were collected. Peripheral blood DNA of each participant was analyzed to detect ALPL gene anomalies. Results: Pathogenic ALPL variants (pALPL) occurred in 23% and benign variants in 36% of patients (bALPL), while nine patients harbored wild-type alleles (wtALPL). Fragility fractures and dental anomalies were more frequent in patients harboring pALPL and bALPL than in wtALPL patients. Of note, wtALPL patients comprised women treated with tamoxifen for hormone-sensitive breast cancer. Mineral and bone markers were similar in the three groups. Mean urine PEA levels were significantly higher in patients harboring pALPL than those detected in patients harboring bALPL and wtALPL; by contrast, serum PLP levels were similar in the three groups. A 6-points score, considering clinical and biochemical features, was predictive of pALPL detection [P = 0.060, OR 1.92 (95% CI 0.972, 3.794)], and more significantly of pALPL or bALPL [P = 0.025, OR 14.33 (95% CI 1.401, 14.605)]. Conclusion: In osteopenic/osteoporotic patients, single clinical or biochemical factors did not distinguish hypophosphatasemic patients harboring pALPL or bALPL from those harboring wtALPL. Occurrence of multiple clinical and biochemical features is predictive of ALPL anomalies, and, therefore, they should be carefully identified. Tamoxifen emerged as a hypophosphatasemic drug.","The study aimed to define the health, biochemical, and genetic features of adult patients with bone strength issues and low serum (blood) alkaline phosphatase (sALP), a protein that helps bone strength. Twenty-two patients with at least two sALP measurements below the desired range were enrolled. Any patients with additional disease or health complications were excluded. Several data points for patient health and biological indicators of disease status were collected. Patient DNA was analyzed to detect ALPL gene anomalies. Several types of mutations within the ALPL gene were found amongst the participant population. These variants include pathogenic (harmful) ALPL variants (pALPL), benign (harmless) variants (bALPL), and wild-type (normal) variants (wtALPL). pALPL are variants that increases a person's chance to get sick from a disease. bALPL are mutations that do not impact human health. wtALPL variants are genes that are not mutated or changed in form. Bone and tooth damage were more frequent in patients harboring pALPL and bALPL than in wtALPL patients. Of note, wtALPL patients comprised women treated with tamoxifen, a drug for breast cancer. Mineral and bone markers were similar in the three groups. Average urine phosphoethanolamine, a compound that can indicate bone disease, was significantly higher in patients with pALPL than the other two variant types. By contrast, serum pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, an indicator of vitamin B6 volume, was similar in the three groups. Certain hospital evaluation techniques were able to predict pALPL and bALPL. In patients with osteoporosis (brittle bones), visible health effects and biological compound indicators do not distinguish hypophosphatasemia (low serum ALP) patients harboring pALPL or bALPL variants from those harboring wtALPL. However, visible health effects and biological compound indicators can be predictive of ALPL anomalies. Therefore, they should be carefully identified. Tamoxifen emerged as a drug to treat hypophosphatasemia.",

Low levels of iron (a mineral that helps the body grow and develop) and too much iron can risk infection. Zinc is a key mineral in the body necessary for keeping the immune system healthy. Food rich in protein should be the top priority because it helps the immune system create protective proteins to fight infections and also has the potential to detect or fight viruses. Therefore, in a regular meal, individuals should eat fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and foods from animal sources (protein). People should eat food from plants containing vitamin A and drink 8-10 cups of water every day. Poor nutrition is dangerous for patients with COVID-19, so proper nutrition should be provided. Fruit juice, tea, and coffee can also be consumed. However, too much caffeine, sweetened fruit juices, fruit juice concentrates, syrups, fizzy drinks, and some still (non-carbonated) drinks must be avoided. Unsaturated fats (healthy fats), white meats, and fish should be eaten. Saturated fat (unhealthy fats that can lead to health problems), red meat, more than 5 grams of salt per day, and industry processed food should be avoided. Along with diet, physical activity is another factor. Individuals should be active and exercise regularly to boost the immune system and should also get enough quality sleep."
24,9600581,"In this double-blind, placebo-controlled 10-week trial, the anxiolytic properties of the nonbenzodiazepine buspirone were compared with the benzodiazepine lorazepam and placebo in 125 outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder according to DSM-III. After a 3- to 7-day wash-out period, patients were allocated at random to receive orally 3 x 5 mg buspirone (n=58), 3 x 1 mg lorazepam (n=57), or placebo (n=10) over a 4-week period. The study also comprised a 2-week taper period and a 4-week placebo-control period to assess the stability of clinical improvement. The patient's clinical state was estimated on entry and at weekly intervals by general practitioners using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment and by a self-rating scale (State Trait Anxiety Inventory X2=STAI-X2). Lorazepam treatment resulted in descriptively, but not significantly, greater improvement on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety during the whole treatment (week 0-4) and taper period (week 5, 6) than did buspirone. After treatment with active drugs had been discontinued, the 4-week placebo control period showed buspirone-treated patients to display a stability of clinical improvement, while the symptoms of lorazepam-treated patients worsened at week 7-10. Both buspirone and lorazepam were more efficacious in reducing anxiety symptoms than placebo during the treatment and taper period; however, in contrast to the active drugs (buspirone, lorazepam), patients of the placebo group showed further clinical improvement during the control period, especially in the HAM-A score, so differences between placebo and active drugs became smaller at the end of the study.","Over 10 weeks, we compared the anti-anxiety drug characteristics of the nonbenzodiazepine buspirone with the benzodiazepine lorazepam and sugar pills in 125 patients outside the hospital with generalized anxiety disorder based on the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. After a 3- to 7-day period for the body to eliminate drugs in the system, patients were randomly given 5 mg buspirone 3 times a day (58 patients), 1 mg lorazepam 3 times a day (57 patients), or sugar pills (10 patients) for four weeks. The study also included a 2-week period when drug amounts were slowly decreased and a 4-week period when all patients took sugar pills to measure the consistency of improvements in anxiety symptoms. Doctors estimated severity of anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the study and weekly using common questionnaires. Patients taking lorazepam showed slightly greater improvement in symptoms than those taking buspirone on one of the questionnaires during the whole treatment (weeks 0-4) and when drug amounts were slowly decreased (weeks 5,6), though not significantly. After patients stopped taking the studied drugs, the 4-week period when patients took sugar pills showed patients who took buspirone showed consistent improvements in anxiety symptoms, while patients who took lorazepam showed worse symptoms at weeks 7-10. Both buspirone and lorazepam worked better than sugar pills to improve anxiety symptoms during treatment and when drug amounts were slowly decreased. However, patients who took sugar pills showed improvements in anxiety symptoms when all patients took sugar pills, especially in one questionnaire, so differences between sugar pills and drugs became smaller at the end of the study.",

The remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) syndrome has been reported with an array of conditions that include polymyalgia rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome and psoriatic arthropathy. Synovitis with pitting edema is now being increasingly recognized with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We report a patient who presented with edema of hands and feet and was diagnosed eventually with definite SLE. With magnetic resonance imaging, joint effusions and tenosynovitis were confirmed to be associated with the otherwise-unexplained extremity edema.","Specialists who treat diseases in the joints, muscles, and bones, called rheumatologists, are increasingly aware of swollen joints (synovitis) with pitting edema, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation. The remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) syndrome is a rare disease with swollen joints and pitting edema. RS3PE has been reported with a number of conditions that include polymyalgia rheumatica (a disorder that causes muscle pain and stiffness, mainly in the shoulders and hips), rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis whereby immune cells attack healthy cells), an immune system disorder that causes dry eyes and mouth called Sjögren's syndrome, and a type of arthritis linked to psoriasis (a skin disease causing red, itchy scaly patches). Synovitis with pitting edema is now being increasingly seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), a chronic disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. Researchers report a patient who presented with edema (swelling) of hands and feet and was diagnosed eventually with definite lupus. With imaging tools, fluid build up in the joints and inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) of the top layer of tendons (tenosynovitis) were confirmed to be associated with the otherwise-unexplained edema in the limbs.",
43,34332661,"Leadless pacemakers (LPs) have revolutionized the field of pacing by miniaturizing pacemakers and rendering them completelty intracardiac, hence reducing complications related to pacemaker pockets and transvenous leads. However, first generation LPs appear to be associated with a higher rate of myocardial perforation as compared to transvenous pacemakers (TV-PPM). Currently, LPs are predominantly designed to pace the right ventricle with no LPs that provide atrial or biventricular pacing. In this article, we review the available data on LPs while advocating for the need for a randomized controlled trial comparing LPs to TV-PPMs. In addition, we review the future directions of leadless devices.","A leadless pacemaker is a small device placed directly into the right ventricle (lower chamber of the heart) which sends pulses to the heart. Leadless pacemakers have changed the field by making pacemakers much smaller and reducing complications related to pacemaker pockets and transvenous (through-vein) leads. However, first generation leadless pacemakers appear to be associated with a higher rate of complications due to punctures as compared to transvenous pacemakers, a temporary pacing technique that places a catheter into the right ventricle (chamber) of the heart and then applies an electric pulse. Currently, leadless pacemakers are mostly designed to pace the right ventricle with none that provide pacing to the upper chambers of the heart or both ventricles. This article reviews the available data on leadless pacemakers while promoting the need for a clinical study that compares leadless pacemakers to transvenous pacemakers. In addition, the future directions of leadless devices is reviewed.",
31,30591350,"Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common, iatrogenic movement disorder affecting many individuals treated with dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs). Studying treatment of TD can be complex, as the symptoms can be affected by changes in either dosage or type of DRBA, as well as by the variable natural course of the disease. Historically many pharmacological therapies have been studied in TD, finding varying degrees of treatment success. Most recently, the VMAT2 inhibitors valbenazine and deutetrabenazine were rigorously studied in TD in large, phase III clinical trials, and were shown to be beneficial in this population. In this article, we will review various treatments of TD, including manipulation of the offending agent, VMAT2 inhibitors, other non-VMAT2-inhibiting medications, and non-pharmacological approaches.","Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common movement disorder in many people taking antipsychotics. Studying treatment of TD can be difficult, because the symptoms can change based on changes to how much or what kind of antipsychotics are used, and by the range of normal disease progression. Many drugs made to treat TD have been studied with different levels of success. Most recently, the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, were studied in TD in large human trials, and were shown to work in this group. In this article, we will look at different treatments of TD, including changing the drug causing TD, VMAT2 inhibitors, other non-VMAT2-inhibiting drugs, and non-drug options.",
