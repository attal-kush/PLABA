53,23831240,"Objectives: Afternoon napping is a common habit in China. We used data obtained from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort to examine if duration of habitual afternoon napping was associated with risks for impaired fasting plasma glucose (IFG) and diabetes mellitus (DM) in a Chinese elderly population. Methods: A total of 27,009 participants underwent a physical examination, laboratory tests, and face-to-face interview. They were categorized into four groups according to nap duration (no napping, <30, 30 to <60, 60 to <90, and > or =90 min). Logistic regression models were used to examine the odds ratios (ORs) of napping duration with IFG and DM. Results: Of the participants, 18,515 (68.6%) reported regularly taking afternoon naps. Those with longer nap duration had considerably higher prevalence of IFG and DM. Napping duration was associated in a dose-dependent manner with IFG and DM (P<.001). After adjusting for possible confounders, longer nap duration (>60 min; all P<.05) was still significantly associated with increased risk for IFG, and longer nap duration (>30 min) was associated with increased risk for DM; however, this finding was not significant in the group with a nap duration of 60-90 min. Conclusions: Longer habitual afternoon napping was associated with a moderate increase for DM risk, independent of several covariates. This finding suggests that longer nap duration may represent a novel risk factor for DM and higher blood glucose levels.","Afternoon napping is a common habit in China. Researchers use data obtained from an existing study to examine if duration of regular afternoon napping is associated with risks for impaired fasting (no food and/or water for a period of time) plasma (blood) glucose (pre-diabetes) and diabetes in a Chinese elderly population. A total of 27,009 participants undergo a physical examination, lab tests, and face-to-face interview. They are placed into groups based on nap duration. The groups are: no napping, less than 30 minutes, 30 to less than 60 minutes, 60 to less than 90 minutes, and 90 minutes or more. Statistical analyses are used to examine the odds of napping duration with getting pre-diabetes and diabetes. Of the participants, 18,515 (68.6%) reported regularly taking afternoon naps. Those with longer naps have much higher numbers of pre-diabetes and diabetes. Napping duration is associated (linked) with pre-diabetes and diabetes. After adjusting the analysis to account for things that impact the results, longer nap duration (>60 minutes) is still significantly associated with increased risk for pre-diabetes. Also, longer nap duration (>30 minutes) is associated with increased risk for diabetes; however, this finding is not significant in the group with a nap duration of 60-90 minutes. In conclusion, longer habitual afternoon napping is associated with a moderate increase for diabetes risk. This finding suggests that longer nap duration may represent a new risk factor for diabetes and higher blood sugar levels.",,"Afternoon napping is a common habit in China.

41,18497742,"In patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) arise from renal tubular epithelial cells containing biallelic inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene. However, it is presumed that formation of renal cysts and their conversion to ccRCC involve additional genetic changes at other loci. Here, we show that cystic lesions in the kidneys of patients with VHL disease also demonstrate activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Strikingly, combined conditional inactivation of Vhlh and the Pten tumour suppressor gene, which normally antagonises PI3K signalling, in the mouse kidney, elicits cyst formation after short latency, whereas inactivation of either tumour suppressor gene alone failed to produce such a phenotype. Interestingly, cells lining these cysts frequently lack a primary cilium, a microtubule-based cellular antenna important for suppression of uncontrolled kidney epithelial cell proliferation and cyst formation. Our results support a model in which the PTEN tumour suppressor protein cooperates with pVHL to suppress cyst development in the kidney.","In patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, kidney cysts (growths) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a type of kidney cancer, come from cells in the kidneys called epithelial cells that inactivate (or turn off) the VHL gene. The VHL gene keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast. However, it is believed that formation of kidney cysts and their change to the ccRCC kidney cancer involve additional genetic changes at other locations. This study shows that cystic wounds in the kidneys of patients with VHL disease also show activation of the enzyme called phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which regulates key cells processes. When two genes called Vhlh and Pten that keep cells from growing too fast are turned off, this brings about cyst formation in the kidneys of mice after a short delay. However, inactivation of only one of these genes fails to produce this same effect. Interestingly, cells lining these cysts frequently lack primary cilium, that acts like a cell antenna and is important for stopping or slowing kidney epithelial cells from multiplying and for stopping cyst formation. These results support a model in which the PTEN tumor suppressor protein cooperates with pVHL to stop cyst development in the kidney.",,"In patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, kidney cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) arise from kidney tubular epithelial cells containing inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene. However, it is assumed that the formation of a cyst in the kidney and their conversion to craters involves additional genetic changes at other locations. Here, we show that cystic lesions in kidneys of people with vHL disease also activate the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Combination conditionally, both Vhlh and the Pten tumour suppression gene, normally antagonises signalling, in mouse kidney, elicits cyst formation after short latency. In fact, either tumor suppressing gene alone failed to produce such an unusual phenotype. Cells lining these cystes often lack the primary cilium, an antenna important for suppression of uncontrolled kidney cell proliferation and cyst form. Our results support an idea in which PTEN, the protein, cooperates with the virus, to suppress cyst development in your kidney.","In patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, kidney cysts (swellings) and clear cell kidney cell carcinoma (ccRCC) arise from kidney tubular epithelial cells (cells that cover the outer surface of the kidney) that activate the VHL tumour suppressor gene. However, it is presumed that formation of kidney kidney cells and their conversion to ccRcc involve additional genetic changes at other loci. Here, researchers show that cystic lesions in the kidneys of people with vHL disease also show activation of a specific pathway. This pathway activates the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, a pathway that regulates the activity of certain proteins. In conclusion, combining conditional inactivation of Vhlh and the Pten (tumour) suppressors gene, which normally helps suppress PI 3K signaling, in a mouse kidney, elicits cyst formation after short periods of time, whereas inactivating either the pten or the Tten gene alone failed to produce such a phenotype. Interestingly, cells lining these cells often lack a primary cilium (cell that helps control cell growth) which is important for blocking uncontrolled kidney surface cell proliferation (growths of cells that swell and swell). These results support a model in which the PTEN (patent-suppressing) tumor protein cooperates with pvHL to suppress the growth and development of stones in kidneys.","In patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, kidney cysts and clear cell kidney cancer (ccRCC) arise from kidney tubular epithelial cells (cells that cover the outer surface of blood vessels) that are inactivated of the VHL tumor suppressor gene.

His family doctor had prescribed a combination of diuretics, 40 mg furosemide and 25 mg spironolactone; however, pitting edema in his lower legs persisted. He was diagnosed with worsening of congestive heart failure because of a previous cardiac surgery and was transferred to our hospital. On admission, we closely observed the patient's condition and noticed that his body temperature increased to 38.0 °C every evening. Furthermore, his ankle joints felt feverish and were swollen. Therefore, we suspected polyarthritis as an etiology, although we initially suspected rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Antibody testing did not support RA diagnosis; therefore we concluded the association of remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) syndrome with his condition.

Aim: Aim of the study was to determine the trends of hCG levels in EP and to explore the role of hCG in decisions related to management and follow-up of EPs. Materials and methods: A retrospective study of women who had EPs from January 2006 to December 2012 at an advanced tertiary care centre in southern India was carried out. These women had undergone treatment based on the hospital protocol. Results: The study identified 337 women with EP. Thirty one surgically confirmed cases were diagnosed below the discriminatory zone of 1500 mIU/ml. Among women who had Beta hCG estimations 48 hours apart, plateauing was observed in 22.5% while decrease >15% was noted in 26.8%. Almost half (47.9%) of the cases had an increase >15% and a few (2.8%) demonstrated an initial fall followed by a rise in titres. In 23.9% of these women, there was a rise >53% similar to intrauterine pregnancy.

19,32383152,"Objectives: Parkinson's disease (PD) features both motor and non-motor symptoms that substantially impact quality of life (QoL). Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) reduces motor complications and improves some non-motor symptoms in advanced PD (APD). Change in patients' health-related quality of life (hrQoL) is a common endpoint in PD trials and has become an important factor in judging overall effect of LCIG. However, hrQoL is considered to be only one dimension of QoL. The primary aim of this prospective observational study was to observe the effects of LCIG on individual quality of life (iQoL) in PD and caregivers.

Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is a gel delivered to patients through a soft tube in the stomach to provide medication. It reduces movement complications and improves some non-motor symptoms in advanced Parkinson's disease. Change in patients' health-related quality of life (how health impacts a person's quality of life) is a common primary outcome in Parkinson's disease studies and has become an important factor in judging overall effect of LCIG. However, health-related quality of life is considered to be only one part of quality of life. The primary aim of this study is to observe the effects of LCIG on individual quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease and caregivers (people who provide care to a person with short or long-term limitations due to disease or injury). The second aim is to investigate its effects on patients' motor and non-motor symptoms as well as effects on caregiver burden. Researchers interviewed patients on individual quality of life and also gave patients questions to answer on their own on personal wellbeing in different areas, such as relationships, life achievements, and safety. Twelve patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and their caregivers were followed for 6 months after starting levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel treatment. At the final follow-up appointment, improvements in individual quality of life for patients and caregivers were seen together with improvements in motor and non-motor symptoms. There were no significant improvements of health-related quality of life. In conclusion, these results suggest that levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel improves individual quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease in addition to the improvement of motor and non-motor symptoms.

7,25229278,"Acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis, which is characterized by inflammation of the posterior pharynx and tonsils, is a common disease. Several viruses and bacteria can cause acute pharyngitis; however, Streptococcus pyogenes (also known as Lancefield group A β-hemolytic streptococci) is the only agent that requires an etiologic diagnosis and specific treatment. S. pyogenes is of major clinical importance because it can trigger post-infection systemic complications, acute rheumatic fever, and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Symptom onset in streptococcal infection is usually abrupt and includes intense sore throat, fever, chills, malaise, headache, tender enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes, and pharyngeal or tonsillar exudate. Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea are uncommon, and their presence suggests a viral cause. A diagnosis of pharyngitis is supported by the patient's history and by the physical examination. Throat culture is the gold standard for diagnosing streptococcus pharyngitis. However, it has been underused in public health services because of its low availability and because of the 1- to 2-day delay in obtaining results. Rapid antigen detection tests have been used to detect S. pyogenes directly from throat swabs within minutes. Clinical scoring systems have been developed to predict the risk of S. pyogenes infection. The most commonly used scoring system is the modified Centor score. Acute S. pyogenes pharyngitis is often a self-limiting disease. Penicillins are the first-choice treatment. For patients with penicillin allergy, cephalosporins can be an acceptable alternative, although primary hypersensitivity to cephalosporins can occur. Another drug option is the macrolides. Future perspectives to prevent streptococcal pharyngitis and post-infection systemic complications include the development of an anti-Streptococcus pyogenes vaccine.","Immediate pharyngitis/tonsillitis, characterized by inflammation of the pharynx (an airway in the throat) and tonsils, is a common disease. Many viruses and bacteria can cause immediate pharyngitis (throat inflammation). However, only Streptoccocus pyogenes (a specific bacteria) needs identification and specific treatment. S. pyogenes, a specific bacteria, is important since it can trigger post-infection issues, immediate rheumatic fever, and kidney disease. Symptoms start abruptly in strep bacterial infection and include intense sore throat, fever, chills, fatigue, headache, enlarged neck lymph nodes, and pharyngeal or tonsillar fluid leakage. Cough, nose and eye inflammation, and diarrhea are uncommon. Their presence suggests a viral cause. Identifying pharynx, or throat, inflammation is supported by patient history and physical examination. Testing throat cells are the gold standard for identifying strep throat. However, testing isolated throat cells is underused due to its low availability and 1- to 2-day delay for results. Rapid antigen, or foreign protein, detection tests may detect bacterial S. pyogenes from throat swabs in minutes. Medical scoring systems have been created to predict risk of S. pyogenes bacterial infection. The most common scoring system is the modified Centor score. Immediate strep throat is often a self-resolving disease. Penicillins, or antibacterial drugs, are the first-choice treatment. For patients with penicillin allergy, cephalosporins (another antibacterial) can be an alternative. Although, immediate immune responses to cephalosporins can occur. Another antibiotic option is macrolides. Future options to prevent strep throat and associated issues include developing an anti-Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial vaccine.","Sore throat/tonsillitis, or when the back of the throat or tonsils is inflamed, is common. Many viruses and bacteria can cause short-term sore throat. However, group A strep, caused by Group A strep bacteria, is the only cause that must be identified based on signs and symptoms and treated. Group A strep bacteria are important to identify because they can cause post-strep throat complications throughout the body, acute rheumatic fever (a disease that inflames the body's tissues), and post-strep throat kidney disease. Strep throat symptoms usually happen quickly and include severe sore throat, fever, chills, general discomfort, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck, and white or yellow spots on the throat or tonsils. Cough, cold symptoms, pink eye, and diarrhea are not common and might be caused by a virus. Learning the person's history and doing a physical exam are used to diagnose strep throat. A throat swab to find, grow, and test bacteria in the throat that make you sick is the best way to diagnose strep throat. However, it has not been used as much as it should because it is not widely available and takes 1 to 2 days to get results. Rapid strep tests have been used to find fragments of bacteria that cause strep throat from swabs within minutes. Scoring systems have been made to predict the risk of strep throat. The modified Centor score is the most common scoring survey. Short-term strep throat often goes away on its own without treatment. Penicillins, a type of antibiotics, are prescribed most commonly. For people allergic to penicillin, cephalosporins, another type of antibiotics, can be prescribed, although people can be allergic to cephalosporins. Another drug option is macrolides, another type of antibiotics. Making an anti-strep throat vaccine could be one way to prevent strep throat and post-strep throat complications throughout the body in the future.","Acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis, a disease characterized by inflammation of the throat and tonsils, is common. Several viruses and bacteria can cause acute pyogenes (also known as Lancefield group A -hemolytic streptococci) is the only agent that requires an etiologic diagnosis and specific treatment. Streptacococcus is of major clinical importance because it can trigger after-infection systemic complications, acute fever, and glomerulonephritis, the swelling of lymph nodes in the neck, throat, or tonsil exudate. Cough, coryza, conjunctivitus (swollen glands and skin infections) and diarrhea are rare, but their presence suggests bacterial cause.

8,33099901,"In the effort to improve treatment effectiveness in glioblastoma, this short note reviewed collected data on the pathophysiology of glioblastoma with particular reference to intersections with the pharmacology of perphenazine. That study identified five areas of potentially beneficial intersection. Data showed seemingly 5 independent perphenazine attributes of benefit to glioblastoma treatment - i) blocking dopamine receptor 2, ii) reducing centrifugal migration of subventricular zone cells by blocking dopamine receptor 3, iii) blocking serotonin receptor 7, iv) activation of protein phosphatase 2, and v) nausea reduction. Perphenazine is fully compatible with current chemoirradiation protocols and with the commonly used ancillary medicines used in clinical practice during the course of glioblastoma. All these attributes argue for a trial of perphenazine's addition to current standard treatment with temozolomide and irradiation. The subventricular zone seeds the brain with mutated cells that become recurrent glioblastoma after centrifugal migration. The current paper shows how perphenazine might reduce that contribution. Perphenazine is an old, generic, cheap, phenothiazine antipsychotic drug that has been in continuous clinical use worldwide since the 1950's. Clinical experience and research data over these decades have shown perphenazine to be well-tolerated in psychiatric populations, in normals, and in non-psychiatric, medically ill populations for whom perphenazine is used to reduce nausea. For now (Summer, 2020) the nature of glioblastoma requires a polypharmacy approach until/unless a core feature and means to address it can be identified in the future. Conclusions: Perphenazine possesses a remarkable constellation of attributes that recommend its use in GB treatment.","To try improving treatment in glioblastoma (a brain cancer), this work collected data on the cancer's symptoms and traits along with references to perphenazine (an anti-psychotic medication). This study found five areas of possibly beneficial treatment. 5 perphenazine attributes of benefit to glioblastoma treatment include blocking two target sites for chemical messengers, reducing movement of specific cells, activating certain enzymes, and reducing nausea. Perphenazine works with current chemradiotherapy and common medicines used to treat glioblastoma. Perphenzaine attributes argue for a trial to add it to current standard treatment with temozolomide (an anti-cancer drug) and irradiation. A specific brain region seeds the brain with mutated cells that become reappearing gliobastoma after outward movement. The current work shows how perphenazine may reduce this outward growing brain cancer. Perphenazine is an old, common, cheap antipsychotic drug used clinically worldwide since the 1950's. Perphenzaine has been well-tolerated in psychiatric groups, in healthy groups, and in non-psychiatric but medically ill groups who use perphenazine to reduce nausea. For now (Summer, 2020), glioblastoma needs a multi-drug approach until a core treatment can be identified. Perphenazine has many attributes that recommend its use in glioblastoma treatment.","To improve how well treatment for glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, works, we looked at studies on the disease-related processes associated with glioblastoma and their interaction with how the antipsychotic perphenazine affects the body. That study found five areas of possibly helpful interaction. Studies showed 5 independent qualities of perphenazine that might help treat glioblastoma, including changing how cells grow and move and reducing nausea. Perphenazine can be taken with current chemotherapy and radiation treatments and with commonly prescribed glioblastoma drugs. These qualities suggest the addition of perphenazine to current chemotherapy and radiation treatment should be studied. Part of the brain sends out damaged cells that become recurring glioblastoma after they move outward. This paper shows how perphenazine might decrease this activity. Perphenazine is an old, generic, cheap drug used to treat psychotic disorders worldwide since the 1950s. Studies over time have shown perphenazine does not cause many side effects in normal people, people with mental illness, and ill people taking perphenazine to reduce nausea. As of Summer 2020, glioblastoma requires multiple drugs to treat it until and unless it is better understood and a single treatment drug is found. We conclude that perphenazine has many qualities that suggest its use in treating glioblastoma.","In the effort to improve treatment effectiveness in glioblastoma, this short note reviewed collected data on the pathophysiology of the brain tumor with particular reference to intersections with the pharmacology of perphenazine.

However, in the current status of laboratory medicine, despite the fact that blood pressure measurement has been used for a long time, not many DBMs contribute to the subsequent diagnosis and treatment. In this article, we discuss studies focusing on peptide fragments in blood identified by comprehensive quantitative methods, among the currently proposed DBM candidates. Furthermore, researchers describe the basic techniques of peptidomics, especially quantitative proteomics (measuring proteins in a body's tissues). This article will also outline the present status and challenges of measuring peptides (peptides in urine) as a biomarker (detecting the presence of a disease-fighting protein) forHDP."
52,29973620,"Turner Syndrome (TS) is a condition where several genes are affected but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Identifying the genes that regulate the TS network is one of the main challenges in understanding its aetiology. Here, we studied the regulatory network from manually curated genes reported in the literature and identified essential proteins involved in TS. The power-law distribution analysis showed that TS network carries scale-free hierarchical fractal attributes. This organization of the network maintained the self-ruled constitution of nodes at various levels without having centrality-lethality control systems. Out of twenty-seven genes culminating into leading hubs in the network, we identified two key regulators (KRs) i.e. KDM6A and BDNF. These KRs serve as the backbone for all the network activities. Removal of KRs does not cause its breakdown, rather a change in the topological properties was observed. Since essential proteins are evolutionarily conserved, the orthologs of selected interacting proteins in C. elegans, cat and macaque monkey (lower to higher level organisms) were identified. We deciphered three important interologs i.e. KDM6A-WDR5, KDM6A-ASH2L and WDR5-ASH2L that form a triangular motif.

In this study, researchers constructed a lactic acide gene called L. plantarum LP18: RBD that uses information from the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (the part of the virus located on the spike protein which is involved in introducing a virus into host cells) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by anchoring to the surface. Researchers also evaluate the immune response in mice by the intranasal administration (a non-invasive route for drug delivery through the nose) of LP18:RBD. The results show that LP18:RBD significantly brought out IgA antibodies (antibodies that play a crucial role in the immune function of mucous membranes) in the organs involved in breathing and in digesting food.

50,28756540,"Background: There is no agreeing if rescue therapy can avoid short-term colectomy in patients treated for severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. Aims: The aim of our study was to identify predictors of response to infliximab and cyclosporine A. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 49 patients with severe ulcerative colitis were included. Response to therapy was defined as three or more point reductions in Mayo score after 6 months of treatment and avoidance of colectomy after 1 year. The predictors analysed were gender, age, time from ulcerative colitis diagnosis, months of steroid or/and azathioprine therapy before onset of the severe phase, smoking habits, extension of the disease, laboratory analyses and Mayo score. Results: Patients treated with infliximab showed a statistically significant higher response rate in case of moderate Mayo score (P = 0.04). Ex-smokers had very low chance of response to infliximab (P = 0.03). In the group treated with cyclosporine A, patients with C-reactive protein >3 mg/L had a response rate significantly higher than those with C-reactive protein <3 mg/L (P = 0.03); those with negative C-reactive protein and moderate Mayo score did not responded to therapy, while in the ones with elevated C-reactive protein and/or severe Mayo score, 15 versus 4 responded (P = 0.008). Conclusions: Our data suggest that cyclosporine A is advisable in ex-smokers. In never smokers or active smokers, infliximab can be prescribed in case of Mayo score ≤10 and/or negative CRP, while cyclosporine A is indicated in case of Mayo score >10 and positive CRP.","It is unknown if rescue therapy, or therapy given after an ailment does not respond to normal treatment, can avoid colectomy (removal of all or parts of colon) in patients treated for severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. Steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis is chronic inflammatory bowel disease that no longer responds to steroid treatment. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of response to infliximab and cyclosporine A, drugs that aim to improve the immune system. In this study, 49 patients with severe ulcerative colitis were included. Response to therapy was characterized as three or more point reductions in Mayo score (a disease ranking system) after 6 months of treatment and avoidance of colectomy after 1 year. Increased Mayo score indicated worsened disease condition. The predictors evaluated were gender, age, time from ulcerative colitis diagnosis, months of steroid or/and azathioprine therapy before onset of the severe phase, smoking habits, extension of the disease, laboratory analyses and Mayo score. Azathioprine is a medication given to improve immune function. Patients treated with infliximab showed a statistically significant higher response rate in case of moderate Mayo score. Ex-smokers had very low chance of response to infliximab. In the group treated with cyclosporine A, patients with a higher volume of C-reactive protein had a response rate significantly higher than those with lower C-reactive protein volume. Patients with negative (no detected) C-reactive protein volume and moderate Mayo score did not responded to therapy. Patients with elevated C-reactive protein and/or severe Mayo score predominately respond. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). This study suggests that cyclosporine A is advisable as treatment in ex-smokers. In never smokers or active smokers, infliximab can be prescribed in case of Mayo score ≤10 and/or negative CRP. However, cyclosporine A is indicated as a better option in case of Mayo score >10 and positive CRP.",,"There is no agreeing if rescue therapy can avoid short-term colectomy in patients treated for severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis.

Eating too much or too little selenium can cause health problems, with a small ideal range for consumption. Studies that look at how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why show a relationship between eating too little selenium and higher rates of inflamed thyroid caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, Graves disease (a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells and lead to an overactive thyroid), and enlarged thyroids. Studies of people taking selenium who have long-term inflamed thyroids caused by thyroid cells attacked by infection-preventing cells generally have bloodwork that suggests more normal thyroid function but no improvement in symptoms.

28,34578187,"SARS-CoV-2 infection has caused a global pandemic that has severely damaged both public health and the economy. The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is multifunctional and plays an important role in ribonucleocapsid formation and viral genome replication. In order to elucidate its functions, interaction partners of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in human cells were identified via affinity purification and mass spectrometry. We identified 160 cellular proteins as interaction partners of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in HEK293T and/or Calu-3 cells. Functional analysis revealed strong enrichment for ribosome biogenesis and RNA-associated processes, including ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, ribosomal large and small subunits biogenesis, RNA binding, catalysis, translation and transcription. Proteins related to virus defence responses, including MOV10, EIF2AK2, TRIM25, G3BP1, ZC3HAV1 and ZCCHC3 were also identified in the N protein interactome. This study comprehensively profiled the viral-host interactome of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in human cells, and the findings provide the basis for further studies on the pathogenesis and antiviral strategies for this emerging infection.","SARS-CoV-2 infection, also known as COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease), has caused a global pandemic that has hurt both public health and the economy. A protein of the virus has several purposes and plays an important role in creating the protective outer shell of the virus and helping the virus replicate itself. In order to better understand how the virus protein works, proteins within human cells that interact with the COVID-19 protein were identified. The authors identified 160 proteins within two different human cell types that interact in some way with the COVID-19 protein. The human proteins found to interact with the virus protein are responsible for several cell functions, all of which impact the creation of more proteins. Additionally, some human proteins identified to interact with the virus protein have roles in defending the body from viruses.

45,31241491,"Background: Effect of nifedipine on pressure ulcer (PU) healing has not been evaluated in the human subjects yet. Study question: In this study, the effect of topical application of nifedipine 3% ointment on PU healing in critically ill patients was investigated. Study design: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical. Measures and outcomes: In this study, 200 patients with stage I or II PU according to 2-digit Stirling Pressure Ulcer Severity Scale were randomized to receive topical nifedipine 3% ointment or placebo twice daily for 14 days. Changes in the size and stage of the ulcers were considered as primary outcome of the study. The stage of the ulcers at baseline and on day 7 and day 14 of study was determined by using 2-digit stirling scale. In addition, the surface area of the wounds was estimated by multiplying width by length. Results: In total, 83 patients in each group completed the study. The groups were matched for the baseline stage and size of PUs. Mean decrease in the stage of PU in the nifedipine group was significantly higher than the placebo group on day 7 (-1.71 vs. -0.16, respectively, P < 0.001) and day 14 (-0.78 vs. -0.09, respectively, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the mean decrease in the surface area of PU was significantly higher in the nifedipine group compared with the placebo group on day 7 (-1.44 vs. -0.32, respectively, P < 0.001) and day 14 (-2.51 vs. -0.24, respectively, P < 0.001) of study. Conclusions: Topical application of nifedipine 3% ointment for 14 days significantly improved the healing process of stage I or II PUs in critically ill patients.","The effect of nifedipine (a common vasodilator medication that widens blood vessels) on pressure ulcers (PU), or bedsores, has not been measured in humans. In this study, the effect of skin-level application of nifedipine 3% ointment on PU healing in very ill patients was investigated. This was a randomized study with a sham treatment group. In this study, 200 patients with mild and moderate PU were randomzed to receive topical nifedipine 3% ointment or dummy treatment twice daily for 14 days. Changes in the size and severity of ulcers were the main measures of the study. The severity of ulcers at baseline, on day 7, and on day 14 of the study was measured. Also, the area of the wounds was estimated by multiplying width by length. In total, 83 patients in each group completed the study. The groups were matched for starting severity and size of PUs. Average decrease in the severity of PU in the nifedipine group was higher than the dummy treatment group on day 7 and day 14. Also, the average decrease in the area of PU was higher in the nifedipine group compared with the sham treatment group on day 7 and 14 of the study.

In this study, we looked at the effect of applying nifedipine 3% ointment to the skin on bedsore healing in critically ill patients. This was a medical study involving human participants in which neither side knew who was getting what treatment and ointment with no medicine was given to a control group. In this study, we randomly gave 200 patients with stage I or II, according to a common scoring system to measure the severity of bedsores, nifedipine ointment applied to the skin or ointment with no medicine two times a day for 14 days. The most important outcome was changes in the size and stage of bedsores. We used the bedsore scoring scale to measure bedsore stage at the beginning of the study and on study days 7 and 14. We estimated the surface area of the bedsores by multiplying width by length. In total, 83 patients in each group completed the study. We compared patients with similar bedsore stage and size at the beginning of the study. The group given nifedipine had significantly higher average decrease in bedsore stage than the group not given nifedipine on days 7 and 14. The group given nifedipine had significantly higher average decrease in bedsore surface area than the group not given nifedipine on days 7 and 14.

When lactobacilli is given through a spray in the nose in mice, it can help regulate the natural immune or infection-fighting response in the lungs and fight lung infections. Lactobacilli bacteria that comes from plants is tested to see how it impacts the immune systems of the cells in the lungs and if it can reduce the ability of the coronavirus (a virus causing COVID-19 - a lung infection) from entering the cells. Two types of lactobacilli bacteria that come from plants, called MPL16 and CRL506, are tested to understand their influence on the production of cells that are part of the immune response and the development of proteins. Additionally, these two types of bacteria increase the resistance of certain cells in the lungs called Calu-3 against the coronavirus.

The best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of how the immunodeficiency milk bacteria can positively influence the replication (or creation of) the new coronovirus. Further studies and experiments in animal models of infection are needed to identify specific strains of beneficial bacteria that can help prevent or treat the Covid- 19 virus."
22,32631372,"Background and objective: The purpose of this study was to create a practical CT-based algorithm to differentiate Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome from other diffuse cystic lung diseases (DCLD). Methods: The study was a retrospective review of the CT images of 33 patients with BHD syndrome, 33 patients with LAM, and 23 patients with NBNL (non-BHD and non-LAM) among DCLD patients. On the basis of the data collected, the CT images were reviewed again to evaluate the characteristics (size, number, distribution, and morphology) of pulmonary cysts. Results: Lower lung-predominant cysts were more likely to be found in patients with BHD syndrome than in patients with LAM or in the NBNL DCLD group. In the axial distribution, 18 of 33 patients in BHD group had cysts that were predominantly near the mediastinum, and all the patients in the LAM and NBNL DCLD groups had diffuse cysts. The appearance of fusiform cysts was more easily observed in patients in the BHD group. In total, 58% patients in the BHD group had less than 50 lung cysts, while all patients in the non-BHD group had more than 50 lung cysts. The biggest cyst was located in the lower lobe in 28 of 33 patients in the BHD group, while 11 of 33 patients in LAM group and 10 patients in the NBNL DCLD group had the biggest cyst in the lower lobe.

The study uses CT scans that were taken prior to the study from 33 patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, 33 patients with a rare disease called LAM where a muscle cell grows in the lungs, and 23 patients with other lung diseases that cause cysts (but are not Birt-Hogg-Dubé or LAM). The CT images are reviewed again to determine the size, number, location, and form of pulmonary cysts (cysts filled with air located on the lung). Cysts mainly located in the lower lung are more likely to be found in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome than in patients with LAM or in the group with other lung diseases. In the Birt-Hogg-Dubé group, 18 out of 33 patients have cysts that are mostly near the area between the lungs. All the patients in the LAM group and the group with other lung diseases have cysts in different locations. Cysts that are fusiform (wide in the middle and taper at the ends) are more easily observed in patients in the Birt-Hogg-Dubé group. In total, 58% patients in the Birt-Hogg-Dubé group have less than 50 lung cysts, while all patients in the non-Birt-Hogg-Dubé group had more than 50 lung cysts.

We present a newly developed, clinically oriented classification of the various types of shock and their therapeutic implications. Results: There are only four major categories of shock, each of which is mainly related to one of four organ systems. Hypovolemic shock relates to the blood and fluids compartment while distributive shock relates to the vascular system; cardiogenic shock arises from primary cardiac dysfunction; and obstructive shock arises from a blockage of the circulation. Hypovolemic shock is due to intravascular volume loss and is treated by fluid replacement with balanced crystalloids. Distributive shock, on the other hand, is a state of relative hypovolemia resulting from pathological redistribution of the absolute intravascular volume and is treated with a combination of vasoconstrictors and fluid replacement. Cardiogenic shock is due to inadequate function of the heart, which shall be treated, depending on the situation, with drugs, surgery, or other interventional procedures. In obstructive shock, hypoperfusion due to elevated resistance shall be treated with an immediate life-saving intervention. Pathogenesis and pathophysiology: The characteristic feature of both, hemorrhagic and traumatic hemorrhagic shock is bleeding. However, differences exist between the two subcategories in terms of the extent of soft tissue damage. Clinically the most significant cause of hemorrhagic shock is acute bleeding from an isolated injury to a large blood vessel, gastrointestinal bleeding, nontraumatic vascular rupture (e.g., aortic aneurysm), obstetric hemorrhage (e.g., uterine atony), and hemorrhage in the region of the ear, nose, and throat (vascular erosion). The shock is triggered by the critical drop in circulating blood volume; massive loss of red blood cells intensifies the tissue hypoxia.","Inequality between the supply and demand of oxygen is the common feature of shock.

Distributive shock relates to the vascular system or blood vessels. Cardiogenic shock arises from primary cardiac or heart dysfunction. Obstructive shock arises from a blockage of circulation. Hypovolemic shock is due to volume loss with blood vessels or blood vascular system. This type of shock is treated by replacement with balanced fluids. Distributive shock is a state of low blood plasma. This type of shock comes from volume displacement in blood vessels. It is treated with a combination of vasoconstrictors, drugs that constrict blood vessels to increase blood pressure, and fluid replacement. Cardiogenic shock is caused by inadequate function of the heart, which shall be treated, depending on the situation, with drugs, surgery, or other treatment methods. In obstructive shock, circulatory failure due to increased resistance will be treated with an immediate life-saving intervention. Both hemorrhagic (excessive bleeding from a ruptured blood vessel) and traumatic hemorrhagic (internal bleeding from an injury) shock feature bleeding. However, differences exist between the two subcategories in terms of how much soft tissue damage they create. The most significant cause of hemorrhagic shock is bleeding from an isolated injury to a critical portion of the body.

Hypovolemic shock relates to the blood and fluids compartment while distributive shock is due to a blockage in the circulatory system. Cardiogenic shock comes from primary heart dysfunction; and obstructive (when the body cannot properly pump enough oxygen) shock arises from blockages in circulation and is treated with a combination of vasoconstrictors (vasors that block blood flow to and from the heart), and fluid replacement (concentration of blood vessels that allow oxygen to flow through the veins) that reduce blood vessel volume. In cardiac shock, the reduced blood volume is caused by reduced fluid flow. Intravascular shock (low blood oxygen levels) is a state of relative low blood levels resulting from pathological redistribution of fluid volume in veins. Controlling shock occurs from a reduced amount of fluids in vessels. Patients should be treated, depending on the situation, with drugs, surgery, or other interventional (surgery) procedures that treat heart failure and heart-related issues. However, patients should also be given immediate life-saving treatment. The most common cause of hemorrhagic shock are immediate bleeding from an isolated injury (isolated injury to an important vessel), gastrointestinal bleeding, nontraumatic vascular rupture (e.g., aortic aneurysm), obstetric hemorrhage (unwanted pregnancy), uterine atony (inflamation of veins and arteries). The shock can be triggered by the critical drop in blood amount; massive loss of red blood cells increases the tissue hypoxia (high blood sugar).","A severe mismatch between the supply and demand of oxygen is the common feature of all types of shock. We describe a new, clinically-oriented classification of the various types and their therapeutic implications. There are only four major categories of shocks, each of which is mainly related to one of four organ systems. Hypovolemic shock relates to the blood and fluids compartment. Distributive shock is a state of relative hypovolemia (low blood pressure) due to redistribution of blood volume and is treated with a combination of vasoconstrictors (blood vessels restricting blood flow) and fluid replacement. Cardiogenic shock refers to a lack of heart function. In obstructive shock, hypoperfusion (decreased heart rate) caused by resistance to drugs, surgery, or other treatments shall be treated immediately with an immediate life-saving intervention. Pathogenesis and pathophysiology: The characteristic features of both, hemorrhagic and traumatic hemorrhagic shock are bleeding. However, differences exist in the two subcategories in terms of how much tissue damage is done. Clinically, the most significant cause of hemorrhagic or sudden bleeding is acute bleeding from an isolated injury to large blood vessel, gastrointestinal bleeding, nontraumatic vascular rupture (e.g., aortic aneurysm), obstetric hemorrhage, uterine atony (birth-related bleeding), and hemorrhage in region of ear, nose, and throat (vascular erosion). The sudden loss of red blood cells intensifies the tissue hypoxia (oxygen shortage).","A severe mismatch between the supply and demand of oxygen is the common feature of all types of shock. We present a newly developed, clinically-oriented classification of the various types to shock and their therapeutic implications. Results: There are only four major categories, each of which is mainly related to one of four organ systems. Hypovolemic shock relates to the blood and fluids compartment. Distributive shock refers to vascular system. Cardiogenic shock arises from primary cardiac dysfunction. Obstructive (or blocked) shock is when there is a blockage of circulation (the flow of blood in and out of a body's cells) and is treated by fluid replacement with balanced crystalloids. Circadian shock, on the other hand, is due to blood volume loss in the heart and kidney. This is done with a combination of vasoconstrictors (vasoders that constrict blood vessels) to reduce blood vessel pressure. Heart-related shock occurs from a lack of heart function, which shall be treated with drugs, surgery, or other interventional (medical) procedures. In obstructive shocks, hypoperfusion (lower than normal blood flow) will need an immediate life-saving intervention. The characteristic of both, hemorrhagic (excessive bleeding) or traumatic (life-threatening) bleeding is bleeding. However, differences exist between subcategories in terms of how much soft tissue damage is caused. Clinically, the most significant cause of bleeding from an isolated injury to a large blood cell, gastrointestinal bleeding, nontraumatic (unnatural) vascular rupture (e.g., aortic aneurysm), obstetric (abnormal) hemorrhage (when the mother's blood leaks into the uterus), and bleeding near the ear, nose, and throat are all examples of this type of swelling and scarring from blood loss. Shock is triggered by the critical drop in circulating (blood) volume; massive loss of red blood cells intensifies the tissue hypoxia (low oxygen in tissues)."
9,25328387,"Objective: In the present study, an attempt was made to examine the effects of aural stimulation with ointment containing capsaicin on swallowing function in order to develop a novel and safe treatment for non-obstructive dysphagia in elderly patients. Patients and methods: The present study included 26 elderly patients with non-obstructive dysphagia. Ointment containing 0.025% capsaicin (0.5 g) was applied to the external auditory canal with a cotton swab under otoscope only once or once a day for 7 days before swallowing of a bolus of colored water (3 mL), which was recorded by transnasal videoendoscopy and evaluated according to the endoscopic swallowing score. Results: After a single application of 0.025% capsaicin ointment to the right external auditory canal, the endoscopic swallowing score was significantly decreased, and this effect lasted for 60 minutes. After repeated applications of the ointment to each external auditory canal alternatively once a day for 7 days, the endoscopic swallowing score decreased significantly in patients with more severe non-obstructive dysphagia. Of the eight tube-fed patients of this group, three began direct swallowing exercises using jelly, which subsequently restored their oral food intake. Conclusion: These findings suggest that stimulation of the external auditory canal with ointment containing capsaicin improves swallowing function in elderly patients with non-obstructive dysphagia. By the same mechanism used by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to induce cough reflex, which has been shown to prevent aspiration pneumonia, aural stimulation with capsaicin may reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in dysphagia patients via Arnold's ear-cough reflex stimulation.","We looked at the effects of rubbing an ointment with capsaicin, found in different types of hot peppers, on the ears to improve swallowing function and create a new and safe treatment for old people who have the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. We looked at 26 old people who had the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. We used a Q-tip to put ointment with 0.025% capsaicin (0.5 g) in the ear only once or once a day for 7 days before drinking 3 mL of colored water, which was recorded using a flexible tube with a camera and rated using a common test that measures how well one swallows. After putting 0.025% capsaicin ointment to the right ear, the common swallowing test showed less difficulty swallowing. This effect lasted for one hour. After putting the ointment on alternating ears once a day for 7 days, the common swallowing test showed less difficulty swallowing in people with more serious sensations of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. Of the eight people fed with tubes in this group, three began direct swallowing exercises using jelly, which then returned their ability to eat food by mouth. We concluded that putting ointment with capsaicin on the ear improves swallowing function in old people who have the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. In the same way as other methods to stimulate the cough reflex, putting capsaicin on the ears may decrease how often people with difficulty swallowing develop pneumonia, caused by something entering the airway or lungs by accident, through a cough reflex stimulated by a nerve.",,"In this study, an attempt was made to examine the effects of hearing stimulation with ointment containing capsaicin on swallowing function in order to develop a new and safe treatment for non-obstructive dysphagia in elderly patients. The present study included 26 elderly people with no obstruction of the systolic movement. A small amount of 0.025% capsicum (0.5 g) was applied to the external auditory canal only once or once every day for 7 days. After one application of 0.50% capaccinoid (0.1 gram) to an ear canal, the swallowed score was significantly decreased, and this effect lasted for 60 minutes. When repeated applications to each internal auditorial canal alternatively once each day, essophagus score decreased significantly in patients with more severe neopauria. Of the eight tube-fed patients of this group, three began direct swallows exercises using jelly, which subsequently restored their oral food intake. These findings suggest that stimulation of external auditor canal with an anecdotal peptide (a drug that inhibits the growth of blood vessels) improves swallower's ability to breathe. By the same mechanism used by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to induce cough reflex (cough reflex), which has been shown to prevent aspiration pneumonia (pneumonia caused by coughing), anaural stimulation (stimulation) may reduce the incidence of airway pneumonia in dyspepsies (increased breathing-related breathing problems).","The present study aims to look at the effects of aural stimulation with ointment containing capsaicin on swallowing function in order to develop a new and safe treatment for non-obstructive dysphagia (a condition in which the body cannot properly swallow food) in elderly patients.

Of the eight tube-fed patients of this study, three began direct swallowing exercises using jelly, which subsequently restored their oral food intake. These findings suggest that stimulation of an external hearing canal (the inner ear) with the capaicins improves swallowing ability (when swallowing food). By the same mechanism used by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to induce cough reflex (an involuntary, uncontrollable cough) which has been shown to prevent aspiration pneumonia (e.g., when the throat becomes too weak to swallow), stimulation by the ear-cough reflex may reduce the incidence of pneumonia in those with less severe disorders. In conclusion, this work suggests that stimulating the internal auditory drainage (ear canal) better than using an anesthetic to stimulate the mouth and throat may decrease the frequency of breathing in people who do not have a normal or normal breathing.","In this study, an attempt was made to examine the effects of aural (ear-to-ear) stimulation with ointment containing capsaicin on swallowing function in order to develop a novel and safe treatment for non-obstructive dysphagia (dysphagia) in elderly patients.

After a single application of 0.025 capsaicin ointment (a type of ointment used to treat breathing-related issues) on the right side of the outside ear, the score for swallowing was significantly decreased, and this effect lasted for 60 minutes. In patients with more severe dysphagia, swallowing scores decreased significantly in patients who applied the ointment to each ear canal more than 7 times per day. Of the eight tube-fed patients of this group, three began direct swallowing exercises using jelly, which subsequently restored their oral food intake.

By the same mechanism used by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to prevent aspiration pneumonia (when a person's breathing gets out of control) and to reduce the risk of aspiration lung infection in dysphagia patients via a nasal-cough reflex (cough-like sensation), stimulation using an ointment that contains capsaicin may decrease the chance of swallowing pneumonia in people who have dysphagia via swallowing difficulties.","In the present study, an attempt was made to examine the effects of aural stimulation with ointment containing capsaicin on swallowing function in order to develop a new and safe treatment for non-obstructive dysphagia (disease of swallowing) in elderly patients.

26,32150748,"Background: A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS.

Little is known about how COVID-19 impacts human health, including how long the disease's incubation period (the time between initial exposure and the first signs of illness) lasts. Knowing the incubation period of the disease is important for preventing further spread. The goal of this paper was to estimate the length of the COVID-19 incubation period and how it impacts the public's health. To reach this goal, the authors reviewed confirmed COVID-19 cases that were reported between January 4th to February 24th in 2020. The information was gathered from news reports and press releases from over 50 locations outside of Wuhan city within the Hubei province of China. Only people with confirmed COVID-19 infection outside of the Hubei province of China were of interest for the evaluation. Patient characteristics (e.g. age, ethnicity) and specific health measurements (e.g. dates of exposure, start of symptoms) were reviewed. In total, 181 confirmed COVID-19 cases with definable exposure points and start of symptoms were evaluated for incubation period estimation. The average incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days. Overall, the majority of people will develop symptoms within 11.5 days after time of infection. These estimates imply that a portion of the population (101 out of every 10,000 COVID-19 patients) will show symptoms after 14 days of quarantine. Because only cases from new outlets and press releases were evaluated, the estimations may be based on more severe COVID-19 cases. Mild cases, which may go unreported, may have a different incubation period. Even though the data for mild COVID-19 cases may differ, this estimate provides support for an average incubation period for COVID-19 of 5 days.

25,34409778,"Hyperinflammation and cytokine storm has been noted as a poor prognostic factor in patients with severe pneumonia related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In COVID-19, pathogenic myeloid cell overactivation is found to be a vital mediator of damage to tissues, hypercoagulability, and the cytokine storm. These cytokines unselectively infiltrate various tissues, such as the lungs and heart, and nervous system. This cytokine storm can hence cause multi-organ dysfunction and life-threatening complications. Mavrilimumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that may be helpful in some cases with COVID-19. During an inflammation, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release is crucial to driving both innate and adaptive immune responses. The GM-CSF immune response is triggered when an antigen attaches to the host cell and induces the signaling pathway. Mavrilimumab antagonizes the action of GM-CSF and decreases the hyperinflammation associated with pneumonia in COVID-19, therefore strengthening the rationale that mavrilimumab when added to the standard protocol of treatment could improve the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, specifically those patients with pneumonia. With this review paper, we aim to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of mavrilimumab on cytokine storms in patients with COVID-19 by reviewing published clinical trials and emphasize the importance of extensive future trials.","Hyperinflammation and overproduction of inflammatory molecules is a poor predictor of recovery in patients with severe pneumonia (an infection that inflames air sacs in lungs) related to the viral respiratory disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In COVID-19, disease-causing white blood cell overactivation is a key mediator of damage to tissues, increased blood clots, and inflammatory molecule overproduction. These inflammatory molecules invade many body parts like the lungs, heart, and nervous system. This overproduction of inflammatory molecules can cause multi-organ damage and life-threatening issues. Mavrilimumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb), which binds to only one site of a foreign organism. It may aid some cases of COVID-19. During inflammation, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release, release of molecules that activate specific white blood cells, is crucial for an immune response. The GM-CSF immune response is triggered when a foreign organism attaches to a cell and activates a signal. Mavrilimumab combats the effect of GM-CSF and reduces hyperinflammation linked to pneumonia in COVID-19. This effect stregthens the idea that mavrilimumab, when added to standard treatment, may improve health outcomes in COVID-19 patients, specifically those with pneumonia. With this paper, we aim to show how mavrilimumab reduces overproduction of inflammatory molecules in patients with COVID-19.","Patients with severe pneumonia or lung infections related to COVID-19 (a viral breathing-related disease) may also have an overactive immune response and cytokine storm, which is when the immune system floods the body with proteins called cytokines. These events are associated with poor outcomes. In COVID-19, excessive activity of immune cells is linked to tissue damage, an increased risk of blood clots, and the cytokine storm. The cytokines enter different tissues, such as the lungs and heart, and the nervous system (the spinal cord, brain, and nerves). This cytokine storm can cause multiple organs to not work properly and cause life-threatening complications. Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. One type of monoclonal antibody that may help some COVID-19 cases is mavrilimumab. During inflammation, the release of a GM-CSF, another type of protein that controls the body's immune responses, is necessary for proper immune responses. These proteins are triggered when a foreign substance attaches to a cell and creates a path for cells to communicate and pass information. Mavrilimumab disrupts the action of GM-CSF and decreases the severe inflammation associated with pneumonia in COVID-19. Therefore, adding mavrilimumab to the standard treatment may improve the condition of COVID-19 patients, especially those with pneumonia. This paper reviews data from published studies to show how mavrilimumab can block cytokine storms in patients with COVID-19, and to highlight the importance of future studies.","Hyperinflammation and cytokine storm has been noted as a poor prognostic factor in patients with severe pneumonia related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Within a short period of time, SARS-CoV-2 has spread around the world. A significant amount of strong scientific evidence now backs up the initial thoughts on how COVID spreads from one person to another. This can improve current policies surrounding COVID-19 health safety rules and prevent the spread of false information. This paper offers a thorough review of the scientific reports concerning the spread of COVID-19. Several laboratory studies have been able to grow live COVID-19 viruses from the air and surfaces, even several hours after the virus was placed there. However, real-world studies that detect COVID-19 genetic material in the environment report very low levels. Few have been able to grow the virus from these samples. Strong evidence from cases and outbreaks shows that COVID-19 mostly spreads through the airways (lungs, throat, nose, and mouth). Distance and ventilation are key factors for risk of spreading COVID-19. Even in the few cases where scientists think the virus spread through contact with people or surfaces, spreading through the airways has not been ruled out. The rate that a person spreads the virus is highest a day before symptoms appear and declines within a week of symptoms appearing. The spread of the COVID-19 virus is different for each person. Most people infected do not spread COVID-19. However, some people infected with COVID-19 can cause many infections in groups, known as ""superspreading events.""

19,32710141,"Purpose: To investigate the comparative effectiveness of dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase type-B (MAO-B) inhibitors available for treatment of Parkinson's disease. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search identifying randomized controlled trials investigating 4 dopamine agonists (cabergoline, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) and 3 MAO-B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline, safinamide) for Parkinson's disease. We extracted and pooled data from included clinical trials in a joint model allowing both direct and indirect comparison of the seven drugs. We considered dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors given as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa. Selected endpoints were change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, serious adverse events and withdrawals. We estimated the relative effectiveness of each dopamine agonist and MAO-B inhibitor versus comparator drug. Results: Altogether, 79 publications were included in the analysis. We found all the investigated drugs to be effective compared with placebo when given as monotherapy except safinamide.

Dopamine antagonists were found to work as treatment for Parkinson’s disease, both when given with a single drug and with two drugs that are similar to one another, respectively, when taking a dummy treatment and using a combination drug to treat the same condition. Selegilline and santanine were the best options for treating Parkinson' disease with one drug while using the second drug combined with another.","Dopamine agonists (drugs that increase the amount of dopamine in the brain) and monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitors available for treatment of Parkinson's disease (a disease that affects movement and coordination). We performed a systematic literature search identifying randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating 4 dopamine agonist drugs (cabergoline, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine, and rasagiline, safinamide, a type of drug that blocks the activity of a specific molecule in a part of the body that helps control movement). 3 of these drugs are MAO B inhibitors. We extracted and pooled data from included clinical trials allowing both direct and indirect comparison of 7 drugs. The seven drugs we looked at were given as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa (an anti-seizure drug used to prevent tremors and movement-related disorders). The study included 79 publications. All the investigated drugs were found to be effective compared with a dummy treatment. When considering combination treatment, the estimated relative effects of selegiline and other drugs that block dopamine were 2.316 (1.819, 2.951), 2.091 (.889, 2.317), 2.037 (1.4804, 2.2294), 1.912 (1.7716, 2.129), 1.664 (1.1113, 2.418), 1.584 (1.49, 1.820) and 1.179 (1.302, 1.352), respectively, compared to joint placebo (no medication) treatment and the antiseizures drug (sedomitamine) used for movement disorders. In conclusion, dopamine-agonists are effective as treatment for the disease, both when taken as a single drug and in conjunction with the drug. Selegiline (another dopamine blocker) is also effective for treating Parkinson disease. Sarifinamide is the best option to combine with other dopamine blockers among all the drugs investigated.","The objective of this study is to investigate the comparative effectiveness of dopamine agonists (dopamine drugs) and monoamine oxidase type ofB (MAO-B) inhibitors available for treatment of Parkinson's disease, a brain disorder in which nerve cells in the brain die.

We extracted and pooled data from included trials in a joint model to allow both direct and indirect comparison of the seven drugs. These drugs are dopamine-related drugs given as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa (a brain medication). Selected endpoints are change in an assessment scale, serious adverse events and withdrawals. The study estimated the relative effectiveness (success) of each dopamine drug versus a comparison drug. Altogether, 79 publications were included in this analysis. All the investigated drugs were found to be effective compared with placebo (no treatment) when given by the patient. When considering combination treatment, the estimated relative effects (the difference between the effects of different treatments) were 2.316 and 1.179, respectively, compared to joint placebo and levidopa treatment. In conclusion, dopamine agents are effective as treatment for Parkinson’s disease when used as a single drug and in addition to levadopa, two other drugs that treat the condition. Selegieline and raasageilin are also effective for treating Parkinson. Among all the drugs investigated, se legileine is the best option to use in conjunction with lvadopopa."

The present study investigated whether the supplementation of soy-derived phosphatidylserine (PS), a naturally occurring phospholipid, improves ADHD symptoms in children who do not already have ADHD. Thirty-six children, aged 4-14 years, who had not previously received any drug treatment related to ADHD, received placebo (no treatment) or 200 mg day(-1) PS (19) for 2 months in a randomised, double-blind manner. Main outcome measures included: (i) symptoms of ADHD based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; (ii) short-term auditory memory and working memory using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children; and (iii) mental performance to visual stimuli (GO/NO GO task). PS supplementation resulted in significant improvements in several measures. These measures include: ADHD (using DSM-IV-TR), AD (P < 0.01) and HD (a test that measures attention and concentration); (II) memory recall and attention differences, and inattention (differentiation and reverse differentiation). No significant differences were observed in other measurements or in the placebo group. PS was well-tolerated and showed no adverse effects. In conclusion, PS significantly improved attention-related symptoms and memory differences in young children with ADHD who did not have it before. Adding PS to the diet might be a safe and natural nutritional strategy for improving mental and physical performance in early children suffering from ADHD that does not yet have the disorder."
47,28401263,"A majority of adults with persistently low serum alkaline phosphatase values carry a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in the ALPL gene and also have elevated alkaline phosphatase substrate values in serum and urine. These adults may fall within the spectrum of the adult form of hypophosphatasia. Introduction: The primary objective of this study was to determine what proportion of adults with persistently low serum alkaline phosphatase values (hypophosphatasemia) harbor mutations in the ALPL gene or have elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) substrates. Some adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia share clinical and radiographic features with the adult form of hypophosphatasia (HPP). In HPP, ALPL mutations result in persistent hypophosphatasemia and ALP substrate accumulation in plasma (pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)) and urine (phosphoethanolamine (PEA)). Methods: Biochemical analyses, including serum ALP activity, bone-specific ALP, plasma PLP, and urine PEA, were performed in adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia. Mutational analyses were performed using PCR and Sanger sequencing methods. Gene variants were classified as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign (LB), and benign (B). P and LP variants were further grouped as ""Positive ALPL variants"" and LB and B grouped as ""Negative ALPL variants."" Results: Fifty subjects completed all mutational and biochemical analyses. Sixteen percent carried only Negative ALPL variants. Of the remaining 42 subjects, 67% were heterozygous for a P variant, 19% for an LP variant, and 14% for a VUS. Biochemical results were highly inter-correlated and consistent with the expected inverse relationship between ALP and its substrates. Subjects harboring Positive ALPL variants showed lower ALP and BSAP and higher PLP and PEA values compared with subjects harboring only Negative ALPL variants. Approximately half of all subjects harboring Positive ALPL variants or ALPL VUS showed elevations in plasma PLP, and three quarters showed elevations in urine PEA. Conclusion: Adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia frequently harbor ALPL mutations and have elevated ALP substrates. These adults may fall within the spectrum of the adult form of hypophosphatasia. Clinicians should take note of persistent hypophosphatasemia in their patients and be cautious in prescribing bisphosphonates when present.

These adults also most likely have elevated alkaline phosphatase substrate values in serum and urine. Alkaline phosphatase can indicate bone health. These adults may suffer from the adult form of hypophosphatasia, an inherited disorder that affects bone and tooth development. The aim of this study was to determine what proportion of adults with hypophosphatasemia (low serum alkaline phosphatase) also have ALPL gene mutations or elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) substrates. Some adults with hypophosphatasemia share observable or radiographic (seen through x-ray) features with the adult form of hypophosphatasia (HPP). In HPP, ALPL mutations cause persistent hypophosphatasemia and ALP substrate (protein) accumulation in plasma (pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)) and urine (phosphoethanolamine (PEA)). Analyses of compounds from biological samples, including serum ALP activity, bone-specific ALP, plasma PLP, and urine PEA, were performed in adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia. Analysis to determine ALPL mutations were performed. Variations of the gene ALPL were classified as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign (LB), and benign (B). Pathogenic mutations often make a person more susceptible to disease. Benign mutations do not affect human health. P and LP variants were further grouped as ""Positive ALPL variants"" and LB and B grouped as ""Negative ALPL variants."" A total of 50 subjects completed all mutational and biochemical analyses. Sixteen percent carried only Negative ALPL variants. Of the remaining 42 subjects, 67% were heterozygous for a P variant, 19% for an LP variant, and 14% for a VUS. Biochemical results were associated with the inverse (opposite) relationship between ALP and its substrates. Subjects harboring Positive ALPL variants had lower ALP and BSAP and higher PLP and PEA values. Approximately half of all subjects harboring Positive ALPL variants or ALPL VUS showed elevations in plasma PLP. Most also showed elevations in urine PEA. Adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia often have ALPL mutations and have elevated ALP substrates. These adults may fall within the spectrum of the adult form of hypophosphatasia. Clinicians should note long-lasting hypophosphatasia in patients and be cautious in giving them anit-bone-breakdown drugs.","Many adults with persistently low blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, a protein that influences levels of the high-energy molecule phosphate, possibly have a mutation in the ALPL gene that encodes alkaline phosphatase. Many adults also have increased phosphate-carrying compounds in blood and urine. These adults may have low blood phosphate levels (hypophosphatasia). The study determines what proportion of adults with persistently low blood alkaline phosphatase levels (hypophosphatasemia) have mutations in the ALPL gene or accumulated phosphate-carrying compounds. Some adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia share symptoms with the adult form of low blood phosphate levels or hypophosphatasia (HPP). In HPP, ALPL mutations lead to persistent hypophosphatasemia and phosphate-carrying compounds in blood (pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) or active vitamin B6) and urine (phosphoethanolamine (PEA) or a key molecule to build cell boundaries). Blood ALP activity, bone-specific ALP, blood PLP, and urine PEA were measured in adults with persistently low levels of ALP. Variations of the ALPL gene were classified as disease-causing or pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely harmless or benign (LB), and benign (B). P and LP variants were also grouped as ""Positive ALPL variants"". LB and B were grouped as ""Negative ALPL variants."" Fifty subjects completed all the tests. Sixteen percent had only Negative ALPL variatns. Of the remaining 42, 67% had at least one copy of the P variant, 19% for an LP variant, and 14% for a VUS. Tests results agreed with each other and showed that the amount of ALP trended oppositely with the quantity of the molecules that it acts upon. Those with Positive ALPL variants had lower ALP and bone-specific ALP and had higher PLP and PEA than those with Negative ALPL variants. Around half of those with Positive ALPL variants or ALPL VUS had increases in blood PLP. Three quarters had increases in urine PEA. Adults with persistently low ALP levels frequently had ALPL mutations and increased phosphate-carrying compounds. These adults may have low blood phosphate levels.","A majority of adults with persistently low serum alkaline phosphatase values carry a disease-causing or likely pathogenic variant in the ALPL gene and also have elevated levels of phosphoethanolamine (PEA) in serum and urine. These adults may fall within the spectrum of the adult form of hypophosphatasia. The primary objective of this study is to determine what proportion of people with consistently low blood (sugar-containing) alkalinity (a condition in which the body does not produce enough calcium) or potassium in blood have mutations (mutations that lead to changes in gene sequences), or have high amounts of potassium (alkali-phosphate (ALP) substrates in plasma (pyridoxal-5-phospho (PLP)) levels. Some adults who have persistent low potassium levels share clinical and radiographic features with the adults form (HPP). In HPP, gene-related (gene-specific) ALP, plasma PLP (proteins that are found in bones) and urinary (pure) PEA. Analyses, including serum potassium level of sodium, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, are performed in adults without persistent hypophosphophosphatemia. Genetic analyses are done using PCR and sequencing methods. Gene variants are classified as pathogen (P), likely (LP), variant(s) of uncertain significance (VUS) (variables of unknown significance). Of the remaining 42 subjects, 67% are heterozygous for one gene variant, 19% for an LP variant and 14% for LB and B. Protein results are highly inter-correlated and consistent with expected inverse relationship between ATP and its substrate. Subjects harboring Positive (positive) ALCL variations showed lower (lower) AP and BSAP (blood-based) protein and higher (highly) high (very high) particle size compared with those with only Negative (no gene variation). Approximately half of all subjects with positive or negative (unusual or unusually rare or very rare), and three quarters showed elevations. Adults with persisting (responsible) Alkaline (an abnormal protein), protein, or protein) genes showed elevated (normally high levels in urine and plasma protein levels, versus those who had only negative genes. Half of subjects had abnormalities in liver protein concentrations, which is correlated with abnormal gene activity.","A majority of adults with persistently low blood alkaline phosphatase values (hypophosphatasemia) carry a pathogenic or likely pathogen variant in the ALPL gene. These adults may also have elevated phosphate phosphate levels in serum (blood) and urine (a mixture of phosphate and other minerals). These people may fall within the spectrum of the adult form of hypophilatasia. The primary objective of this study is to determine what proportion of people with long-lasting low levels of sodium phosphate (an enzyme that monitors blood levels) harbor mutations in a gene or have high phosphate phosphases (ALP) substrates. In HPP, ALP mutations result in persistent low sodium phosphate levels and ALP substrate accumulation in plasma (pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)) and in urine. Biochemical analyses, including blood ALP activity, bone-specific ALP, plasma PLP (PEA), urine PEA, are performed in adults who have persistent high sodium phosphorus levels. Mutational analyses are done using PCR and Sanger sequencing methods. Gene variants are classified as harmful, likely harmful (LP), variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign, and benign (B). P and LP variants were further grouped as ""Positive AL PL PLPL variants"" and LB and B grouped respectively. Fifty subjects completed all mutational and biochemical analyses. Sixteen percent carried only Negative ALpl variants. Of the remaining 42 subjects, 67% were heterozygous for a P variant, 19% for an LP variant (variants that are unknown to the patient), and 14% with a VUS variant. Genetic results are highly inter-correlated and consistent with the expected inverse relationship between ALP and its substrate. Subjects with Positive ALPl variants showed lower ALP (specific) ALP levels (as measured by a specific gene) levels compared with subjects harboring only negative (non-AlPL) variants (or variants). Approximately half of all subjects who had positive or non-alPL variant showed elevations (increases in blood) of plasma PPA. Three quarters showed increases (decreases), respectively (upgradations) in urinal (abnormal) phosphate level (particles that absorb phosphate from the body). In conclusion, Adults with persistent sodium phosphantase levels frequently harbor ALPs mutations and have higher phosphate substrate values, which may indicate an increased level of alkal phosphate in body fluids. However, these adults are likely to fall outside the child form. Clinicians should take note of persistent decreased sodium levels within their patients and be cautious in prescribing drugs when present.","A majority of adults with persistently low serum (blood) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values carry a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in the ALPL gene and also have elevated ALP substrate values in serum and urine. These adults may fall within the spectrum of the adult form of hypophosphatasia. This study aims to determine how many adults have persistent low ALP values (hypophosphatasemia) and have mutations (changes in a gene that makes a protein) or have high ALP substrates (proteins that bind to the ALP molecule) in their blood. Some people with persistent ALP levels share clinical and radiographic (physical exam) features with people who have a rare, inherited, and often fatal type of HPP, which is when the body's natural defense system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. In this case, mutations result in long-lasting ALP and ALP-substrate accumulation in plasma (pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)), urine (phosphoethanolamine (PEA), and blood cells. Biochemical analyses, including blood ALP activity, bone-specific ALP, plasma PLP and PEA values, were performed in adults who had persistent hypophosphataseemia. Gene variants were classified as pathogenic (P), likely (LP), variants of uncertain significance (VUS), possibly benign (LB), or benign. P and LP variants are further grouped as ""positive"" and ""negative"" variants. Of the remaining 42 subjects, 16 percent carried only negative variants (no mutations). Sixty-three percent were heterozygous for a P variant, 19% for an LP variant and 14% for the VUS. Results were highly correlated and consistent with the expected relationship between ALP (a protein that binds to a molecule). Subjects harboring positive ALP variant showed lower ALP concentration and BSAP and higher ALP concentrations compared with subjects who only had negative ALP variations. Approximately half of all subjects harboring Positive ALP variants showed elevations (increases or changes in levels of a specific protein). Three quarters had elevations in urine PSAP values. The authors conclude that adults (people who are not yet diagnosed with a disease) frequently carry mutations or mutations in APL genes. They may be within a spectrum (range of) of adult-type of Hypophosphapathy. Clinicians should take note of persistent, be cautious in prescribing bisphosphonates (anti-phosphorusinhibitors) when present.","A majority of adults with long-lasting low blood alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values carry a pathogenic or likely harmful variant in the ALPL gene and also have high ALP substrate values in blood and urine. These adults may fall within the spectrum of the adult form of hypophosphatasia (HPP). In HPP, gene changes result in persistent low levels of ALP and ALP substrates in plasma (pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), blood-specific ALP, plasma PLP (PEA), urine PEA). Biochemical (measurement) analyses, including blood ALP activity, bone (abdomen) ALP (substance in bones), and blood (protein) PEP are performed in adults who have long lasting low-alkaline-pipetase values. Gene variants are classified as harmful (P). Pathogenic (LP), variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign (LB). and benign. P and LP variants were further grouped as ""Positive"" and LB and B were ""Negative"" alterations. Fifty subjects completed all mutational and biochemical analyses. Sixteen percent carried only negative alterations in AL PL variants. Of the remaining 42 subjects, 67% were heterozygous for a P variant. 19% for an LP variant, and 14% had a VUS. Results are highly inter-correlated and consistent with the expected inverse relationship (disparity) between ALP protein and its substrate. Subjects harboring positive ALpl variants showed lower ALP proteins and higher PLPs and Peps compared with those with only Negative alterations (no changes). Approximately half of all subjects with positive alterations showed elevations (increases) in plasifal PLp and three quarters showed rises in urine pep-amine. In conclusion, adult patients with persistent lower-than-normal ALP values often have altered alterations and have higher ALP molecules. The adults in this study often harbor altered mutations and are more likely to have elevated ALP monoclonal monoamine transporter type 1 (AMAT1) or AMAT2, which is a type of protein found in bone, blood, urine and other body fluids, than those who do not have changed alterations or amatoids (drugs that can lead to disease). The adult patient with ongoing low ALP-protein values frequently has altered altered changes and has higher ALP molecules than patients without altered alters. This study's objective is to determine how many adults have persistently low alkal phosphate values (hypoph phosphateatasemia) and who has changed mutations or has high ALL monoaminamin transporter 1 in their genes. Some adults that have persistent high-kidney-ametamine levels share clinical and radiographic (medical and imaging) features with adult forms of subnormal blood phosphate levels. Alterations or changes to the gene cause persistent under-absorption of sodium and potassium in patients and may also cause elevated ALMAs. Clinicians should take note of persistent sub-optimal blood phosphate levels and be cautious in prescribing bisph phosphonates (anti-inflammatory drugs) when present."

We present this study to further enrich the knowledge of physicians towards the effect of different patient characteristics upon predicting extra-corporal shock wave lithotripsy success rates. Methods: We evaluated 155 patients who received ESWL for renal and ureteric stone measuring 3-20 mm (mm), over a 3-month period. The stone size in millimeters, density in Hounsfield units (HU) and its location was determined on pre-treatment CT-KUB. ESWL was successful if post-treatment residual renal stone fragments were ≤3 mm and for ureteric stones should be totally cleared. Results: The overall success of ESWL treatment was observed in 65.8% of the 155 patients. There was no significant difference seen when the effect of patients age, sex and BMI were studied with ESWL outcome with P values were 0.155, 0.101 and 0.415 respectively. Also, stone location either in the kidney or ureter has no statistically significant effect on ESWL response rate. while stone density and size determined on CT KUB have statistically significant effect on the success rate of ESWL with a P-value of 0.002 and 0.000 respectively. Conclusions: This study shows that determination of stone density and stone size on CT KUB pre ESWL can help to predict the outcome of ESWL. We propose that stone density <500 HU and stone size < 5 mm are highly likely to result in successful ESWL.","Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a procedure to break up stones in the body by using shock waves and an X-ray to target the stones. Researchers search for the effects of patient characteristics (age, sex, and body mass index or BMI) and stone characteristics (density, location, and size) on how successful ESWL procedure is on stones in the kidneys, ureters (tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder), and bladder. This study is intended to increase the knowledge of doctors on the effect of different patient characteristics on predicting how successful using extra-corporal shock wave lithotripsy is. Researchers evaluate 155 patients who receive ESWL for stones in the kidney and ureter (tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) over a 3-month period. The stone size in millimeters (mm), density, and its location is determined using an x-ray scan before patients received treatment. ESWL is considered to be successful if the size of remaining kidney stone fragments after the procedure are ≤3 mm and if ureteric stones are totally cleared. The overall success of ESWL treatment was observed in 65.8% of the 155 patients. There is no major difference seen when the effect of age, sex, and BMI of patients are studied with ESWL outcomes. Also, stone location either in the kidney or ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) has no statistically significant effect (not likely to happen randomly or by chance) on the success of ESWL. Stone density and size based on the scanned images have a statistically significant effect on the success rate of ESWL. In conclusion, this study shows that finding out the density and size of stones using a scanned x-ray image before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) can help predict the outcome of ESWL.

Although many studies have been done for more than 50 years, there is not enough data to make a clear conclusion. All data for the main outcomes in this review were of very low quality evidence. At best, we can say that the antipsychotic showed similar effects to other antipsychotic drugs. However, more studies are needed to better understand how this drug works and how it affects the body. Since it is a relatively inexpensive and frequently used drug, further studies should be done to clarify the properties.","Phenothiazine is an old antipsychotic with a potency similar to haloperidol.

The objective of this study is to examine the effects and safety of perphenazine for those with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses. Although per Phenzane is used in randomised trials for more than 50 years, incomplete reporting and the variety of comparisons used make it impossible to draw clear conclusions. All data for the main outcomes in this review are of very low quality evidence. At best, this paper can say that per phenazine showed similar effects, side effects as many of the other anti-psychotic drugs.

47,34547524,"Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is the heritable dento-osseous disease caused by loss-of-function mutation(s) of the gene ALPL that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). TNSALP is a cell-surface homodimeric phosphomonoester phosphohydrolase expressed in healthy people especially in the skeleton, liver, kidneys, and developing teeth. In HPP, diminished TNSALP activity leads to extracellular accumulation of its natural substrates including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), an inhibitor of mineralization, and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the principal circulating form of vitamin B6 (B6). Autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance involving >450 usually missense defects scattered throughout ALPL largely explains the remarkably broad-ranging severity of this inborn-error-of-metabolism. In 1985 when we identified elevated plasma PLP as a biochemical hallmark of HPP, all 14 investigated affected children and adults had markedly increased PLP levels. However, pyridoxal (PL), the dephosphorylated form of PLP that enters cells to cofactor many enzymatic reactions, was not low but often inexplicably elevated. Levels of pyridoxic acid (PA), the B6 degradation product quantified to assess B6 sufficiency, were unremarkable. Canonical signs or symptoms of B6 deficiency or toxicity were absent. B6-dependent seizures in infants with life-threatening HPP were later explained by their profound deficiency of TNSALP activity blocking PLP dephosphorylation to PL and diminishing gamma-aminobutyric acid synthesis in the brain. Now, there is speculation that altered B6 metabolism causes further clinical complications in HPP. Herein, we assessed the plasma PL and PA levels accompanying previously reported elevated plasma PLP concentrations in 150 children and adolescents with HPP. Their mean (SD) plasma PL level was nearly double the mean for our healthy pediatric controls: 66.7 (59.0) nM versus 37.1 (22.2) nM (P < 0.0001), respectively. Their PA levels were broader than our pediatric control range, but their mean value was normal; 40.2 (25.1) nM versus 39.3 (9.9) nM (P = 0.7793), respectively.

HPP is caused by mutations of the gene ALPL. ALPL encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). TNSALP is an enzyme that assists in breaking down phosphate groups. Phosphate groups are important in activating proteins. TNSALP is expressed in healthy people, especially in the skeleton, liver, kidneys, and developing teeth. In HPP, decreased TNSALP activity leads to extracellular accumulation of its natural substrates, including pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). PLP is the principal circulating form of vitamin B6 (B6). Different mutations of ALPL largely explains the remarkably broad-ranging severity of this genetic inborn-error-of-metabolism. In 1985, elevated (blood) plasma PLP was identified as hallmark of HPP. In the study, all 14 investigated affected children and adults had increased PLP levels.

Levels of pyridoxic acid (PA), a compound used to determine B6 levels in the body, were unremarkable. Signs or symptoms of B6 deficiency or toxicity were absent. B6-dependent seizures in infants with life-threatening HPP were later explained by their low TNSALP activity. Lack of TNSALP activity was blocking PLP dephosphorylation, removal of phosphate groups, to PL. This diminished formation of gamma-aminobutyric acid, a neurotransmitter, in the brain.

After the first clinical sign for Covid-19 starts, the positivity rate and other measures to find the percentage of positive and negative (no virus) results in tests that are true positive, called positive predictive value, and true negative results, called negative predictive value, are calculated each week. Combinations of tests are measured to better understand how the primary tests are working. Maps are created to show how the different tests operate.

We aimed to describe the positivity rate (the rate at which a test detects a virus or infection) of SARS Covirus tests using three different measurement methods over a long period. Two hundred sixty-eight samples from 180 symptomatic patients with Covid-9 and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test followed by serological (measurement) investigation of antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) are included in this study. Positivity rates, as well as positive (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs), are calculated for each week after first clinical presentation (when a patient is admitted to the hospital and tests positive for the virus). Furthermore, combinations of tests are assessed within an orthogonal testing approach employing two independent assays. Predictive values were calculated. Heat maps were created to graphically illustrate operational test characteristics. During a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, chemiluminescence (or fluorescence) tests and one ELISA (an antibody-measuring test) showed stable positive rates after third week. With the exception of ECLIA, the PPVs (positive test scores) were ≥95% for Covids only after second week, while other lab tests had somewhat lower PPV scores. IgM, a type of antibody, did not have enough predictive characteristics to be able to predict a positive or negative result. The confirmation of negative results using another lab test provided lower NPVs than the single assay. When interpreting results from tests from coronovirus testing, it is important to consider the pretest probability, time of blood draw, and assay characteristics must be carefully considered. Orthogonic testing increases the accuracy of positive, but not negative, predictions."

This syndrome and the pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in your hand that result from it are caused by pressure on the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. Guidelines published in the May 2019 issue of JOSPT make recommendations, based on best practices from the published literature, for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating carpal tunnel syndrome. For you as a patient, these guidelines outline the best rehabilitation treatment options based on the scientific research. Ultimately, the best care is a combination of the leading science, the clinical expertise of your health care provider, and your input as the patient. These guidelines help inform the first step in that process. Practical Advice: Physical therapists are well trained to assess and evaluate people with carpal tunnel syndrome. Although some patients (anywhere from 28% to 62%) recover without treatment, others (from 32% to 58%) get worse. A key to nonsurgical treatment shown to help those with carpal tunnel syndrome is the use of a night brace; a night brace should hold your wrist in a neutral position and only be worn for short-term symptom relief. If you have mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, stretching exercises and the night brace can help, as can manual therapy of your cervical spine and upper extremity performed by a therapist. Education on the proper setup of your computer, especially the mouse, and how hard you strike the keyboard may also help control your symptoms of pain and loss of feeling. The literature review for these guidelines found that low-level laser therapy, thermal ultrasound, iontophoresis, and magnets provided no consistent benefit in treating carpal tunnel syndrome.

37,20194915,"Background: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can be associated with neurotoxic side effects including cognitive dysfunction, a problem of considerable importance given the usual long-term course of treatment. Pregabalin is a relatively new AED widely used for the treatment of seizures and some types of chronic pain including fibromyalgia. We measured the cognitive effects of 12 weeks of pregabalin in healthy volunteers. Methods: Thirty-two healthy volunteers were randomized in a double-blind parallel study to receive pregabalin or placebo (1:1). Pregabalin was titrated over 8 weeks to 600 mg/d. At baseline, and after 12 weeks of treatment, all subjects underwent cognitive testing. Test-retest changes in all cognitive and subjective measures were Z scored against test-retest regressions previously developed from 90 healthy volunteers. Z scores from the placebo and pregabalin groups were compared using Wilcoxon tests. Results: Thirty subjects completed the study (94%). Three of 6 target cognitive measures (Digit Symbol, Stroop, Controlled Oral Word Association) revealed significant test-retest differences between the pregabalin and placebo groups, all showing negative effects with pregabalin (p < 0.05). These cognitive effects were paralleled by complaints on the Portland Neurotoxicity Scale, a subjective measure of neurotoxicity (p < 0.01). Conclusion: At conventional doses and titration, pregabalin induced mild negative cognitive effects and neurotoxicity complaints in healthy volunteers.

37,33515658,"Pregabalin (PGB) is an analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. The currently available evidence favors the misuse and abuse potential of PGB. However, its neurotoxicity remains unclear. Therefore, this study assessed the toxic effects of chronic pregabalin dependence as well as withdrawal on the cortical neurons of the frontal lobe. This study included eighty adult male albino rats which were divided into three groups. Group I (Control) included 40 rats and was further subdivided into two equal subgroups (IA and IB) as negative and positive controls. Group II (PGB-dependent) included 20 rats which received PGB starting with the therapeutic dose (300 mg/day), then the doses were gradually increased until they reached the dependent dose (3400 mg/day) by the end of the first month. Further, the dependent dose was given daily for another 2 months. Group III (PGB withdrawal) included 20 rats which received PGB as described in group II. After that, administration of PGB was stopped and the rats were kept for another one month. By the end of the experiment, all animals were sacrificed by cervical decapitation. The specimens were taken from the frontal cortex for histologic and immunohistochemical staining as well as morphometric analysis. Sections of the frontal cortex of group II showed changes in the form of disturbed architectural pattern of cortical layers, apoptotic cells, weak immunoexpression of Bcl-2 and VEGF as well as moderate-strong immunoexpression of iNOS and nestin. These expressions were significantly different from the control groups, but they were non-significant in comparison with group III. These findings indicate that chronic PGB dependence induces neurotoxic effects mainly in the form of neuronal apoptosis, gliosis, and oxidative stress injury of the frontal cortex. The PGB- induced neurotoxic effects persisted after withdrawal. The influence of these neurotoxic effects and their relevance to the cognitive or neurologic disorders in PGB-dependent individuals warrants further research. Furthermore, it is recommended to quantify the behavioral changes related to PGB dependence as well as withdrawal in future studies.","Pregabalin (PGB) - a nerve pain medication - is an analog of the inhibitory (silencing) neurotransmitter, (chemical messenger in the brain) gamma-aminobutyric acid. Analogs are compounds that have similar structure to other compounds but are not identical. The currently available evidence favors the misuse and abuse potential of PGB. However, its neurotoxicity (poison to the brain) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess (measure) the toxic effects of long term dependence on pregabalin. Additionally, the study aimed to assess how withdrawal from (removal of) PGB affects cortical neurons (brain cells) in the front lobe of the brain.

Group I (Control) included 40 rats and was further subdivided into two equal subgroups (IA and IB) as negative and positive controls - groups to compare the treatment group to. Group II (PGB-dependent) included 20 rats. Each rat received PGB starting with the therapeutic (beneficial) dose (300 mg/day). The doses were gradually increased until they reached the dependent (full) dose (3400 mg/day) by the end of the first month. Further, the dependent dose was given daily for another 2 months. Group III (PGB withdrawal) included 20 rats which received PGB as described in Group II. After that, administration (use) of PGB was stopped, and the rats were kept for another one month.

By the end of this experiment, all animals were sacrificed by cervical decapitation (cut off the neck). The specimens were taken from the frontal cortex for histologic and immunohistochemical staining (measuring how the brain works) and morphometric analysis (analyzing the changes in the body's structure and how cells move and interact with other cells) to determine how well the cells work. Sections in group III showed changes, including disturbed architectural pattern of cortical layers, apoptotic cells, weak immunoexpression of Bcl-2 and VEGF, and moderate-strong immunosuppressive expression of iNOS and nestin. These expressions were significantly different than the control groups, but they were non-significant in comparison with groups III and IV. Overall, these findings suggest that chronic Poggalin dependence leads to neurotoxic effects mainly (in the form of neuronal apoptosis, gliosis (redness and swelling from fighting an infection), and oxidative stress injury (damage to the nervous system). These effects persisted after withdrawal. Researchers need further research. Furthermore, it is recommended to quantify the behavioral changes related to Pgg dependence and withdrawal in future studies.","Pregabalin (PGB) is an analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. The currently available evidence favors the misuse and abuse potential of PGB. However, its neurotoxicity is unclear. Therefore, this study assessed the toxic effects of long-term pregablignin dependence as well as withdrawal on the cortical neurons (cells that control movement) in the frontal lobe. This study included eighty adult male albino rats which were divided into three groups. Group I (Control) included 40 rats and was further subdivided into two equal groups (IA and IB) as negative and positive controls. Groups II and III included 20 rats each which received the drug starting with the therapeutic dose (300 mg/day). Then, the doses were gradually increased until they reached the dependent dose (3400 mg per day) by the end of first month. Further, groups III and IV received daily doses for another 2 months. After that, treatment was stopped and all animals were sacrificed by cervical decapitation (slaughtering the neck and spine). The rats were kept for one month after that. All animals are sacrificed when the experiment is over. Samples were taken from frontal cortex for histologic (tissue analysis) and immunohistochemical (blood-drawing) staining. Also, samples were analyzed for morphometric (body composition) analysis. These samples showed changes in areas of cortical layers, apoptotic cells, weak immunoexpression of Bcl-2 and VEGF (anti-tumor proteins), moderate-strong immune expression of iNOS (interleukin signaling pathway), and nestin, which is a protein that helps the immune system recognize and respond to foreign substances. Compared to the control groups, these changes were not significant in comparison with group III. In group II, there were differences in other areas, but these differences were non-significant compared to group IV. Chronic PG dependence induces neurotoxic effects mainly on neuronal apoptosis (cell death), gliosis, and oxidative (oxidative damage) stress injury of brain cells. When the effects are stopped, they persist after withdrawal. Furthermore, it is recommended to measure the behavioral changes related to PGAB-dependent individuals and their relevance to cognitive or neurologic disorders.","Pregabalin (PGB) is an analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (a chemical messenger).

Further, the dependence dose was given daily for another 2 months. After that, administration (medication) was stopped and the rats were kept for a further one month to complete the study. All animals were sacrificed by cervical decapitation (removal from the neck). Tests were done on the frontal cortex of group II for histologic and immunohistochemical staining (measuring the immune system's response to an infection) and morphometric analysis (the study's description of a person's physical characteristics).

These expressions were significantly different from groups I and II, but they were non-significant in comparison with group III. Long-term PPG dependence leads to neurotoxic effects mainly from cell death, inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting a bacterial infection), and oxidative stress injury (damage to the body's natural defense system) of brain cells. Neurodegeneration (or damage to brain and nerve cells) that occur after withdrawal (when the drug is no longer given to patients) continued after the drugs were stopped. Furthermore, it is recommended to quantify the behavioral changes related to PBG dependence and withdrawal. In future studies, researchers should measure the changes in behavior."

35,28634907,"Background: Existing guidelines for repeat screening and treatment monitoring intervals regarding the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans are conflicting or lacking. The Choosing Wisely campaign recommends against repeating DXA scans within 2 years of initial screening. It is unclear how frequently physicians order repeat scans and what clinical factors contribute to their use. Objective: To estimate cumulative incidence and predictors of repeat DXA for screening or treatment monitoring in a regional health system. Design: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5992 women aged 40-84 years who received initial DXA screening from 2006 to 2011 within a regional health system in Sacramento, CA. Main measures: Two- and five-year cumulative incidence and hazard rations (HR) of repeat DXA by initial screening result (classified into three groups: low or high risk of progression to osteoporosis, or osteoporosis) and whether women were prescribed osteoporosis drugs after initial DXA. Key results: Among women not treated after initial DXA, 2-year cumulative incidence for low-risk, high-risk, and osteoporotic women was 8.0%, 13.8%, and 19.6%, respectively, increasing to 42.9%, 60.4%, and 57.4% by 5 years after initial screening. For treated women, median time to repeat DXA was over 3 years for all groups. Relative to women with low-risk initial DXA, high-risk initial DXA significantly predicted repeat screening for untreated women [adjusted HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.40-2.00)] but not within the treated group [HR 1.09 (95% CI 0.91-1.30)]. Conclusions: Repeat DXA screening was common in women both at low and high risk of progression to osteoporosis, with a substantial proportion of women receiving repeat scans within 2 years of initial screening. Conversely, only 60% of those at high-risk of progression to osteoporosis were re-screened within 5 years.

A campaign to avoid unnecessary medical tests, treatments and procedures does not suggest DXA scans within 2 years of the first test. How often and for which patient characteristics doctors order repeat scans is unclear. We aim to estimate the number of people at risk who develop osteoporosis over a period and predictors of repeat DXA for checks and treatment check-ins in a healthcare facility. We studied 5992 women aged 40-84 years who underwent DXA scans to check for osteoporosis from 2006 to 2011 at a healthcare facility in Sacramento, CA. Main test scores included two- and five-year amounts and risks of repeat DXA by initial test results (classified into three groups: low or high risk of worsening to osteoporosis, or osteoporosis) and whether women were given osteoporosis drugs after the first DXA. For women not treated after a first DXA, 2-year amounts for low-risk, high-risk, and osteoporotic women were 8.0%, 13.8%, and 19.6%, respectively, increasing to 42.9%, 60.4%, and 57.4% by 5 years after the first screening.

In conclusion, repeat xray scans for DXC are common in women both at low and high risk for progression to bone thinning, with a large proportion of women receiving the scans after the initial exam. Conversely, only 60% of those at high risks of bone breaking are re-screened within five years. Interventions are needed to help clinicians make higher-value decisions regarding repeat X-rays to use again and again."

The 'internal' control monitors the change in potassium as it moves in and out of cells to help maintain a stable level of potassium. The 'external' control is responsible for excreting (releasing) the potassium, and the kidney is the main part of this process. The kidney releases nearly 90% of the daily intake of potassium.

47,34711245,"Background: Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) encoded by the ALPL gene is of particular importance for bone mineralization. Mutation in the ALPL gene can lead to persistent low ALP activity resulting in the rare disease Hypophosphatasia (HPP) that is characterized by disturbed bone and dental mineralization. While severe forms are extremely rare with an estimated prevalence of 1/100.000, recent studies suggest that moderate form caused by heterozygous mutations are much more frequent with an estimated prevalence of 1/508. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of low AP levels in the population based on laboratory measurements. Methods: In this study, the prevalence of low AP activity and elevated pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) levels was analyzed in 6.918.126 measurements from 2011 to 2016 at a single laboratory in northern Germany. Only laboratory values of subjects older than 18 years of age were included. Only the first measurement was included, all repeated values were excluded. Results: In total, 8.46% of the measurements of a total of 6.918.126 values showed a value < 30 U/L. 0.59% of the subjects with an ALP activity below 30 U/L had an additional PLP measurement.

Phosphate groups are important in activating proteins. TNSALP is encoded by a gene, known as ALPL, that is of particular importance for bone mineralization or when minerals deposit onto bone. Mutation, or a structural change, in the ALPL gene can cause persistent low alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. ALP is an enzyme that helps bone strength. Low ALP activity can result in the rare disease Hypophosphatasia (HPP). HPP is characterized by disturbed bone and dental or tooth mineralization. Severe forms of HPP are extremely rare. However, there is an estimated prevalence of 1/100,000 people. Recent studies suggest that moderate HPP is more common with an estimated prevalence of 1/508 people. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of low ALP levels in the population based on laboratory measurements. The prevalence of low AP activity and elevated pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) levels was analyzed in 6,918,126 measurements from 2011 to 2016. PLP is a co-enzyme or helper in several body processes. Only laboratory values of subjects older than 18 years of age were included. Only the first measurement was included. All repeated values were excluded. In total, 8.46% of the measurements showed a value < 30 U/L. 0.59% of the subjects with an ALP activity below 30 U/L had an additional PLP measurement. Of the participants, 6.09% showed elevated pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) levels. This suggest that 0.52% of subjects show signs of HPP. These data support the estimation that the prevalence of moderate forms of HPP is higher than expected. The authors recommend automatic measurement of PLP in cases of low ALP activity.

47,28238808,"Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is the inborn-error-of-metabolism that features low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (hypophosphatasemia) caused by loss-of-function mutation(s) of the gene that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of ALP (TNSALP). Autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant inheritance from among >300 TNSALP (ALPL) mutations largely explains HPP's remarkably broad-ranging severity. TNSALP is a cell-surface homodimeric phosphohydrolase richly expressed in the skeleton, liver, kidney, and developing teeth. In HPP, TNSALP substrates accumulate extracellularly. Among them is inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a potent inhibitor of mineralization. Superabundance of extracellular PPi explains the hard tissue complications of HPP that feature premature loss of deciduous teeth and often rickets or osteomalacia as well as calcific arthropathies in some affected adults. In infants with severe HPP, blocked entry of minerals into the skeleton can cause hypercalcemia, and insufficient hydrolysis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the major circulating form of vitamin B6, can cause pyridoxine-dependent seizures. Elevated circulating PLP is a sensitive and specific biochemical marker for HPP. Also, the TNSALP substrate phosphoethanolamine (PEA) is usually elevated in serum and urine in HPP, though less reliably for diagnosis. Pathognomonic radiographic changes occur in pediatric HPP when the skeletal disease is severe. TNSALP mutation analysis is essential for recurrence risk assessment for HPP in future pregnancies and for prenatal diagnosis. HPP was the final rickets/osteomalacia to have a medical treatment. Now, significant successes using asfotase alfa, a mineral-targeted recombinant TNSALP, are published concerning severely affected newborns, infants, and children. Asfotase alfa was approved by regulatory agencies multinationally in 2015 typically for pediatric-onset HPP.","Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a genetic condition that blocks metabolic pathways. HPP features low serum (blood) alkaline phosphatase (ALP - a protein which indicates bone health) activity (hypophosphatasemia). This is caused by mutation(s) of the gene that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme (form) of ALP (TNSALP). This mutation renders the gene unable to complete it function. Variations in the type of mutations largely explains HPP's remarkably broad-ranging severity. TNSALP is an enzyme expressed in the skeleton, liver, kidney, and developing teeth. In HPP, TNSALP substrates (proteins altered by TNSALP) accumulate outside of cells. One substrate is inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a potent inhibitor (blocker) of mineralization. Superabundance of extracellular PPi explains the hard tissue complications of HPP.

55,34540633,"This is a comprehensive literature review of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). We provide a description of the background, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management regarding CFS. CFS is a multifaceted illness that has many symptoms and a wide array of clinical presentations. As of recent, CFS has been merged with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Much of the difficulty in its management has stemmed from a lack of a concrete understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis. There is a potential association between dysfunction of the autoimmune, neuroendocrine, or autonomic nervous systems and the development of CFS. Possible triggering events, such as infections followed by an immune dysregulation resulting have also been proposed. In fact, ME/CFS was first described following Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infections, but it was later determined that it was not always preceded by EBV infection. Patient diagnosed with CFS have shown a noticeably earlier activation of anaerobic metabolism as a source of energy, which is suggestive of impaired oxygen consumption. The differential diagnoses range from tick-borne illnesses to psychiatric disorders to thyroid gland dysfunction. Given the many overlapping symptoms of CFS with other illnesses makes diagnosing it far from an easy task.

This study provides a description of the background, cause, development, diagnosis, and management regarding CFS. CFS is a multifaceted illness that has many symptoms and a wide array of clinical presentations. As of recent, CFS has been merged with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). ME is a disease characterized with profound fatigue, abnormal sleep, and pain. Much of the difficulty in its management has stemmed from a lack of a concrete understanding of its cause and development. There is a potential association between dysfunction of the autoimmune (immune cells attacking healthy cells), neuroendocrine (brain- and hormonal-related system), or autonomic nervous systems and CFS development. Possible triggering events, such as infections followed by an immune dysregulation, have been proposed as potential causes. ME/CFS was first described following Epstein Barr virus (EBV - herpes virus) infections. It was later determined that it was not always preceded by EBV infection. Patient diagnosed with CFS have shown a noticeably earlier activation of anaerobic metabolism (no-oxygen energy production on the cellular level) as a source of energy. This suggests impaired oxygen consumption. The differential (different) diagnoses range from tick-borne illnesses to psychiatric disorders to metabolism-regulating thyroid gland dysfunction. The many overlapping symptoms of CFS with other illnesses makes diagnosis very hard. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers it a diagnosing of exclusion, meaning other illnesses have to first be excluded before CFS diagnosis can be offered. The CDC states that self-reported fatigue for a minimum of six months and four additional symptoms are necessary for diagnosis. These symptoms include: memory problems, sore throat, post-exertion illness, tender cervical (neck) or axillary (armpit) lymph nodes, muscle pain, multi-joint pain, headaches, and troubled sleep. Management of CFS is just as difficult. Treatment ranges from conservative (e.g. antidepressants) to minimally invasive (surgical) management. Minimally invasive management can involve transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (non-surgical electrical pain relief) of target points. This treatment was shown to improve fatigue and associated symptoms in a 2017 study. The understanding of CFS is continuously evolving as the medical community tries to learn more about it. Further reliable studies will be conducted, providing a better grasp of what the syndrome encompasses. From this, researchers will be able to improve diagnosis and management of the disease.",,"This is a comprehensive literature review of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).

47,34515659,"Summary: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare and under-recognised genetic defect in bone mineralisation. Patients presenting with fragility fractures may be mistakenly diagnosed as having osteoporosis and prescribed antiresorptive therapy, a treatment which may increase fracture risk. Adult-onset HPPhypophosphatasia was identified in a 40-year-old woman who presented with bilateral atypical femoral fractures after 4 years of denosumab therapy. A low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and increased serum vitamin B6 level signalled the diagnosis, which was later confirmed by identification of two recessive mutations of the ALPL gene. The patient was treated with teriparatide given the unavailability of ALP enzyme-replacement therapy (asfotase alfa). Fracture healing occurred, but impaired mobility persisted. HPP predisposes to atypical femoral fracture (AFF) during antiresorptive therapy; hence, bisphosphonates and denosumab are contraindicated in this condition. Screening patients with fracture or 'osteoporosis' to identify a low ALP level is recommended. Learning points: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare and under-recognised cause of bone fragility produced by impaired matrix mineralisation that can be misdiagnosed as a fragility fracture due to age-related bone loss. Antiresorptive therapy is contraindicated in HPP. Low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) provides a clue to the diagnosis. Elevated serum vitamin B6 (an ALP substrate) is indicative of HPP, while identification of a mutation in the ALPL gene is confirmatory. Enzyme therapy with recombinant ALP (asfotase alfa) is currently prohibitively costly. Treatment with anabolic bone agents such as teriparatide has been reported, but whether normally mineralized bone is formed requires further study.","Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare and under-recognized genetic defect in bone mineralization. Bone mineralization is when bone become calcified. Patients presenting with fragility fractures may be mistakenly diagnosed as having osteoporosis (brittle bones). These patients may be prescribed antiresorptive therapy, or drugs that block the breakdown of bone. These drugs may increase fracture risk. Adult-onset HPP was identified in a 40-year-old woman. She had with femur fractures after 4 years of using denosumba, a drug to treat osteoporosis. A low serum (blood) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and increased serum vitamin B6 level signaled the diagnosis. Her diagnosis of HPP was later confirmed by identification of two recessive gene mutations of the ALPL gene. ALP is an enzyme that helps bone strength. ALPL is the gene that encodes ALP. The patient was treated with teriparatide (an osteoporosis drug) due to the unavailability of ALP enzyme-replacement therapy. The fractures healed. However, her mobility was impaired. HPP makes someone more likely to experience femur fractures during antiresorptive therapy. Because of this, bisphosphonates (drugs that limit bone density) and denosumab should not be given to people with this condition. Healthcare workings should screen patients with fracture or 'osteoporosis' to identify a low ALP level. HPP is a rare and under-recognized cause of bone fragility. HPP is caused by impaired mineralization that can be misdiagnosed as a fragility fracture due to age-related bone loss. Antiresorptive therapy is not recommended in HPP treatment. Low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can aid in diagnosis. Elevated serum vitamin B6 (a chemical that works with ALP) is suggestive of HPP. Identifying mutations within the ALPL gene can confirm HPP status. Therapy with a chemical ALP reacts with, known as asfotase alfa, is currently unmanageably expensive. Treatment with anabolic (repairing) bone agents has been reported. However, if this treatment helps normally mineralized bone form needs further study.",,"Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare and under-recognised genetic defect in bone mineralisation.

23,32668217,"Phenylketonuria (PKU), caused by variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, is the most common autosomal-recessive Mendelian phenotype of amino acid metabolism. We estimated that globally 0.45 million individuals have PKU, with global prevalence 1:23,930 live births (range 1:4,500 [Italy]-1:125,000 [Japan]). Comparing genotypes and metabolic phenotypes from 16,092 affected subjects revealed differences in disease severity in 51 countries from 17 world regions, with the global phenotype distribution of 62% classic PKU, 22% mild PKU, and 16% mild hyperphenylalaninemia. A gradient in genotype and phenotype distribution exists across Europe, from classic PKU in the east to mild PKU in the southwest and mild hyperphenylalaninemia in the south. The c.1241A>G (p.Tyr414 Cys)-associated genotype can be traced from Northern to Western Europe, from Sweden via Norway, to Denmark, to the Netherlands. The frequency of classic PKU increases from Europe (56%) via Middle East (71%) to Australia (80%). Of 758 PAH variants, c.1222C> T (p.Arg408Trp) (22.2%), c.1066-11G>A (IVS10-11G>A) (6.4%), and c.782G> A (p.Arg261Gln) (5.5%) were most common and responsible for two prevalent genotypes: p.[Arg408Trp];[Arg408 Trp] (11.4%) and c.[1066-11G>A];[1066-11G>A] (2.6%). Most genotypes (73%) were compound heterozygous, 27% were homozygous, and 55% of 3,659 different genotypes occurred in only a single individual. PAH variants were scored using an allelic phenotype value and correlated with pre-treatment blood phenylalanine concentrations (n = 6,115) and tetrahydrobiopterin loading test results (n = 4,381), enabling prediction of both a genotype-based phenotype (88%) and tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness (83%).

We estimated that 0.45 million individuals have PKU worldwide at a given point in time, occurring in 1 in 23,930 live births (range: 1 in 4,500 [Italy]-1 in 125,000 [Japan]). Comparing genetic makeups and observable PKU symptoms from 16,092 affected people showed differences in disease seriousness in 51 countries from 17 world regions, with the worldwide observable PKU symptoms being 62% classic PKU, 22% mild PKU, and 16% mild elevated phenylalanine blood levels. Observable PKU symptoms and genetic makeups differ across Europe, from classic PKU in the east to mild PKU in the southwest and mild elevated phenylalanine blood levels in the south. A specific genetic alteration can be followed from Northern to Western Europe, from Sweden through Norway, to Denmark, to the Netherlands. The part of the population with classic PKU at any point in time increases from Europe (56%) through the Middle East (71%) to Australia (80%). Of 758 genetic alterations, three were the most common (22.2%, 6.4%, and 5.5%, respectively) and caused two widespread genetic types at any point in time (11.4% and 2.6%, respectively). Most genetic makeups (73%) were compound heterozygous (both forms of the gene have different mutations), 27% were homozygous (both forms of the gene have the same mutation), and 55% of 3,659 different genetic makeups happened in only one person. Genetic alterations associated with PAH were scored and connected with pre-treatment blood phenylalanine levels (6,115 patients) and results from a test to predict long-term treatment responsiveness (4,381 patients). This allowed prediction of both observable PKU symptoms based on genetic makeup and treatment responsiveness.

There is some evidence that perphenazine is more likely to cause akathisia and less likely to cause severe toxicity, but most adverse effect results were equivocal. The number of studies as well as the quality of studies is low, with quality of evidence for the main outcomes ranging from moderate to very low, so more randomised evidence would be needed for conclusions to be made.","Drugs used to treat psychotic disorders are the main treatment for schizophrenia (a reality-distorting mental illness).

In this study, we attempted to screen circRNAs that can be used to predict postoperative recurrence and survival in patients with gastric cancer (GC). Methods: High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in GC patients with different prognoses. The expression level of circRNAs in the training set (n = 136) and validation set (n = 167) was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Kaplan-Meier estimator, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and cox regression analysis were used to evaluate the prognostic value of circRNAs on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in GC patients. CeRNA network prediction, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed for the circRNAs with prognostic significance. Results: A total of 259 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in GC patients with different RFS. We found two circRNAs (hsa_circ_0005092 and hsa_circ_0002647) that highly expressed in GC patients with good prognoses, and subsequently established a predictive model for postoperative recurrence and prognosis evaluation, named circPanel.

CircRNAs have attracted increasing attention in recent years for their potential application as disease biomarkers due to their high abundance and stability. Biomarkers are measurable, biological substances that can indicate disease in a patient. The authors aimed to screen circRNAs that can be used to predict post-operation recurrence and survival in patients with gastric cancer (GC), cancer of the stomach. Tests were used to identify differentially (uniquely) expressed circRNAs in GC patients with different prognoses or forecasts of the disease. The expression level of circRNAs in the training and validation sets were detected by laboratory testing. Training and validation sets are used in scientific modeling to train the artificial intelligence machine and then validate its output, respectively. Several statistical tests were used to predict the amount of circRNAs on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in GC patients. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) refers to the time between the day of diagnosis of a disease and the day the patient relapses into illness. Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the day of disease diagnosis that the patients are still alive. Several bioinformatics tests evaluating disease recurrence and gene expression were performed for the circRNAs with prognostic significance (estimating the future disease course). A total of 259 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in GC patients with different RFS. Two circRNAs were highly expressed in GC patients with good prognoses. These results established a predictive model for postoperative recurrence (disease relapse) and prognosis evaluation (likely course of disease), named circPanel.

13,11403753,"Background: For patients presenting with atrial fibrillation of only a few weeks duration, the use of transesophageal echocardiography offers the opportunity to markedly abbreviate the duration of atrial fibrillation before cardioversion. We sought to determine if the shorter duration of atrial fibrillation allowed by a transesophageal echocardiography strategy had an impact on the recurrence of atrial fibrillation and prevalence of sinus rhythm during the first year following cardioversion. Methods: Transesophageal echocardiography was attempted in 539 patients (292 men, 247 women; 71.6 +/- 13.0 years.) with atrial fibrillation > or =2 days (66.1% <3 weeks) or of unknown duration before elective cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. Therapeutic anticoagulation at the time of transesophageal echocardiography was present in 94.6% of patients, and 73.4% of subjects were discharged on warfarin. Results: Atrial thrombi were identified in 70 (13.1%) patients. Successful cardioversion in 413 patients without evidence of atrial thrombi was associated with clinical thromboembolism in 1 patient (0.24%, 95% confidence interval: 0.0--0.8%). In patients with atrial fibrillation <3 weeks at the time of cardioversion (a duration incompatible with conventional therapy of 3 to 4 weeks of warfarin before cardioversion), the 1-year atrial fibrillation recurrence rate was lower (41.1% vs. 57.9%, P <0.01), and the prevalence of sinus rhythm at 1 year was increased (65.8% vs. 51.3%, P <0.03). No other clinical or echocardiographic index was associated with recurrence of atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm at 1 year. Conclusions: Early cardioversion facilitated by transesophageal echocardiography has a favorable safety profile and provides the associated benefit of reduced recurrence of atrial fibrillation for patients in whom the duration of atrial fibrillation is <3 weeks.","Atrial fibrillation is a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots or stroke. For patients that had atrial fibrillation for only a few weeks, using a test that produces pictures of the heart called transesophageal echocardiography is an opportunity to shorten the duration of atrial fibrillation before cardioversion, a procedure used to return an irregular or very fast heartbeat to a normal rhythm. Researchers aimed to find out if the shorter time period of atrial fibrillation from using transesophageal echocardiography impacts how often atrial fibrillation returns and the frequency of sinus rhythm in the first year after cardioversion. Sinus rhythm is the pattern of your heartbeat based on the sinus node of your heart which sends out electrical pulses. Transesophageal echocardiography is used in 539 patients who had atrial fibrillation for two or more days (more than half had atrial fibrillation for less than 3 weeks) or for an unknown duration before non-emergency cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. Blood thinners at the time of the transesophageal echocardiography were used in almost all patients, and 73.4% were discharged on warfarin, a blood thinner to prevent blood clots. Heart-related blood clots were found in 70 (13.1%) patients. Among patients who successfully had the cardioversion procedure, 1 patient had clinical thromboembolism, a blood clot in the vein. In the patients who had atrial fibrillation for less than 3 weeks at the time of cardioversion, the return of atrial fibrillation in the first year was lower, and the frequency of sinus rhythm at 1 year increased. No other clincal or heart evaluations are associated with returning atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm at 1 year. Having the cardioversion procedure earlier by using the transesophageal echocardiography is shown to be a safe method and is associated with reducing the return of atrial fibrillation in patients who have had the heart condition for less than 3 weeks.",,"For patients presenting with atrial fibrillation of only a few weeks, the use of transesophageal echocardiography (a technique used to measure heart rate and blood pressure) offers the opportunity to significantly shorten the duration of the condition before going to the hospital.

The procedure was attempted in 539 patients (292 men, 247 women; 71.6 +/- 13.0 years.) with the heart beat > or =2 days (66.1% 3 weeks) or of unknown duration before elective heart surgery. Therapeutic anticoagulation was present in 94.6% of patients, and 73.4% of subjects were discharged on warfarin. Atrial thrombi were identified in 70 (13.1%) patients. Successful cardiversion in 413 patients without evidence of heartbeat was associated with clinical blood clotting in 1 patient. In patients with an average of 3 weeks (or less) at the time of surgery (which is incompatible with conventional therapy of three to four weeks of warfighter before cardioverter), the 1-year rate of occurrence of an irregular heart beating was lower. There was an increase in the number of people with sinus beats at 1 year. No other clinical or echocardiographic index was linked with recurring of that same period of time.

In 539 patients (292 men, 247 women; 71.6 +/- 13.0 years) with an irregular heartbeat > or =2 days (66.1% <3 weeks) or of unknown duration before elective (decreased) (concentrated) cardioverting (exercversion) is done. Anticoagulation at the time of treatment was present in 94% of patients. 73.4% were discharged on warfarin (an anti-seizure medication). Atrial thrombi (the blood vessel lining that carries electrical signals to the heart) were identified in 70 (13%.1%) patients who did not have an abnormal heartbeat. Successful (accumulated) conversion in 413 patients without evidence of a heart rhythm was linked with a reduced risk of heart failure in 1 patient (0.24%, 95% confidence interval) and a reduction in the frequency (number of blood clots) associated with the occurrence of irregular beats at 1 year. This study concluded that using a procedure that involves inserting a small device into the lower part of your throat at 3 weeks is a favorable safety profile and provides the associated benefit of reduced (no detection) occurrence (increase in frequency) for patients in whom the average (average) time to have a normal or abnormal heart beating is < 3.5 weeks.","For patients presenting with atrial fibrillation of only a few weeks duration, the use of transesophageal echocardiography (a type of ultrasound) offers the opportunity to greatly shorten the duration of arrhythmia before cardioversion (when the heart beats faster than normal).

In patients with irregular atrial beats at the time of cardiac procedure, 1-year recurrence rate was lower (41.1% vs. 57.9%, P.0.01). The prevalence of irregular sinus rhythms at 1 year was increased (65.8% vs 51.3%). No other clinical or echocardiographic (heart-related) index was linked with the occurrence of atrial or sinus-rhythm episodes at one year. Cardioversion performed early has a favorable safety profile and provides the associated benefit of reduced atrial-fibrillation recurrence for patients in whom the length of the irregular-heart beat is less than 3 weeks.","For patients presenting with atrial fibrillation (a fluttery and rapid heartbeat) of only a few weeks duration, the use of transesophageal echocardiography offers the opportunity to greatly shorten the duration before cardioversion (the procedure of replacing a damaged blood vessel with a new one). The study's objective is to determine if the shorter duration allowed by a technique that uses a camera in the throat to monitor heart rate had an impact on the recurrence (increase in number of cases) and prevalence of sinus rhythm, or irregular heart beat, during the first year after cardioversions. Transesphagean e chocadiography is attempted in 539 patients (292 men, 247 women; 71.6 +/- 13.0 years.) with heart-related problems > or =2 days (66.1% <3 weeks) or of unknown duration (unidentified duration) before elective (medication-only) cardiovert (removal of an abnormal blood clot). Therapeutic anticoagulation (antibacterial medication) is present in 94% of patients, and 73.4% are sent home on warfarin (anti-infection medication). Atrial thrombi (blood clots) are identified in 70 of the patients. Successful (or successful) cardiac surgery in 413 patients with no evidence of a blood clot is associated with clinical (medical) throids in 1 patient. In patients who have atriotic fibillation less than 3 weeks at the time of heart surgery, 1-year (over 1 year) heart rhythm rate is lower and the prevalence (amount of) sinu rhythm at 1 years is increased. No other clinical or chinese or cardiac imaging is linked with the re-emergence or increase in sinul rhythm (an irregular rhythm) after a year. The authors conclude that early (substance-reduced or drug-free) cardiopulmonary therapy facilitated by an imaging technique has a favorable safety profile and provides the associated benefit of reduced (decreased) frequency of atriairfillation for patients in whom the length of time the heart is fluttering is <2 weeks. There is no link between the type of imaging that is used to measure heart health and a decrease in frequency or amount of sine waves."

Asthma is connected with gene-environment interactions, which is when two different genes respond to something in the environment in different ways. There is agreement that there are certain times during pregnancy and early in a child's life when environmental factors (such as food, pollutants, and temperature) may shape asthma's development. This review considers biologic factors, such as brain chemistry, genes, nutrition, gender, and hormone levels, as well as sociologic factors, such as education and economic activity, in the development of allergies and asthma. Studies show that the strategy of decreasing exposure to one allergen (any substance that causes an allergic reaction) does not impact asthma prevention. However, decreasing exposure to more than one allergen has shown a positive effect, such as improved health or symptoms. It is suggested that asthma and other allergic diseases represent an error in how our genes and the environment interact.

34,33439824,"Background: Approximately 10% of adults in Germany have chronic kidney disease (CKD). The prevalence of CKD among patients being cared for by general practitioners is approximately 30%, and its prevalence in nursing homes is over 50%. An S3 guideline has been developed for the management of CKD in primary care. Methods: The guideline is based on publications retrieved by a systematic search of the literature for international guidelines published in the period 2013-2017, and additional searches on specific questions. It was created by the German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Allgemeinmedizin und Familienmedizin, DEGAM) and consented with the German Societies of Nephrology and Internal Medicine (DGfN, DGIM) and patient representation. Results: Upon the initial diagnosis of CKD (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 mL/ min), the patient's blood pressure and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) should be measured, and the urine should be examined for hematuria. Monitoring intervals are determined on an individual basis depending on the stage of disease and the patient's general state of health and personal preferences. Nephrological consultation should be obtained if the GFR is less than 30 mL/min, if CKD is initially diagnosed (GFR 30-59 mL/min) in the presence of persistent hematuria without any urological explanation or of albinuria in stage A2 or higher, if the patient has refractory hypertension requiring three or more antihypertensive drugs, or if the renal disease is rapidly progressive. The threshold for referring a patient should be kept low for persons under age 50; persons over age 70 should be referred only if warranted in consideration of their comorbidities and individual health goals. Conclusion: The main elements of the treatment of CKD are the treatment of hypertension and diabetes and the modification of lifestyle factors. An innovation from the primary care practioner's perspective is the assessment of albuminuria with the albumin-to-creatinine ratio.","About 10% of adults in Germany have chronic kidney disease, which is when the kidneys are damaged and can't filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. The percentage of chronic kidney disease among patients being cared for by primary care doctors (family doctors) is about 30% and is over 50% in nursing homes. A guideline has been developed for the care of chronic kidney disease in primary (family) care offices. This guideline is based on existing, available data in articles published during 2013 - 2017 and also on additional searches of data on specific questions. It is created by the German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians and agreed with by the German Societies of Nephrology and Internal Medicine and patient representation. At the first diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, the patient's blood pressure, as well as a urine sample that may indicate a kidney complication from high proteins, should be measured. The urine should also be checked for the presence of blood. How often the patient should be monitored is based on the individual and depends on the stage of disease, the patient's overall health, and personal preferences. A doctor who specializes in kidney disease should be consulted based on tests that check how well the kidneys are working, if there is blood in the urine, if the patient's blood pressure requires 3 or more drugs, and if the kidney disease is quickly getting worse. The requirements and test levels to refer a patient under the age of 50 years for specialty care should be kept low. People over 70 should be referred only if necessary due to other illnesses and individual health goals. The main parts of treating chronic kidney disease are the treatment of high blood pressure and diabetes and changing lifestyle. A new assessment from the family doctor is a sign of kidney disease due to too much of a protein called albumin in the urine.",,"Approximately 10% of adults in Germany have chronic kidney disease (CKD), a disease of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and its prevalence in nursing homes (nursing homes) is over 50%.

41,34486178,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited renal disorder that results from mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2, encoding polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively. Downregulation or overexpression of PKD1 or PKD2 in mouse models results in renal cyst formation, suggesting that the quantity of PC1 and PC2 needs to be maintained within a tight functional window to prevent cystogenesis. Here we show that enhanced PC2 expression is a common feature of PKD1 mutant tissues, in part due to an increase in Pkd2 mRNA. However, our data also suggest that more effective protein folding contributes to the augmented levels of PC2. We demonstrate that the unfolded protein response is activated in Pkd1 knockout kidneys and in Pkd1 mutant cells and that this is coupled with increased levels of GRP94, an endoplasmic reticulum protein that is a member of the HSP90 family of chaperones. GRP94 was found to physically interact with PC2 and depletion or chemical inhibition of GRP94 led to a decrease in PC2, suggesting that GRP94 serves as its chaperone. Moreover, GRP94 is acetylated and binds to histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a known deacetylase and activator of HSP90 proteins. Inhibition of HDAC6 decreased PC2 suggesting that HDAC6 and GRP94 work together to regulate PC2 levels. Lastly, we showed that inhibition of GRP94 prevents cAMP-induced cyst formation in vitro. Taken together our data uncovered a novel HDAC6-GRP94-related axis that likely participates in maintaining elevated PC2 levels in Pkd1 mutant cells.","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited kidney disorder that causes many cysts (growths) and is caused by changes in either the PKD1 or PKD2 genes. These genes are used to make the proteins polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), which regulate cells growth, cell movement, and interaction with other cells. In experiments with mice, when the PKD1 or PKD2 genes are less sensitive to other cells or make too many proteins, it may lead to cysts forming in the kidneys. This suggests that the number of PC1 and PC2 proteins needs to be stable within a brief time period to prevent the formation of cysts. In this study, researchers show that more cells and proteins from PC2 is a common feature of PKD1 changes, in part because of an increase in PKD2. However, this data also suggests that more effective protein folding, which is when a protein changes from a long chain to a functional shape, contributes to more levels of PC2 proteins. Researchers show that the unfolded protein response is active in the kidneys without Pkd1 and in Pkd1 mutant (changed) cells. This effect is in addition to increases in the number of an endoplasmic reticulum protein, called GRP94. The endoplasmic reticulum helps create and package proteins in cells. GRP94 is found to physically interact with PC2, and reducing or slowing GRP94 can lead to a decrease in PC2, suggesting that GRP94 serves as its chaperone (plays a part in the folding of itself as a protein). Also, GRP94 is acetylated (modified structurally) and attaches to histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), an enzyme that can control several important proteins and activate other proteins. Slowing or stopping HDAC6 decreases PC2 proteins, suggesting that HDAC6 and GRP94 work together to regulate PC2 levels. Lastly, researchers show that the slowing of GRP94 prevents the formation of cysts in laboratory tests. Together, these data uncover a new HDAC6-GRP94-related point that likely participates in maintaining higher PC2 levels in Pkd1 mutant cells.",,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited kidney disorder that results from mutations in either PKD1 or PDD2, which are proteins that encode two types of proteins. Downregulation (or overexpression) or overexpression (infection-fighting) of PHD1 (a protein that binds to other proteins) results in kidney cyst formation. This suggests that the amount of PC1 and PC2 needs to be maintained within the same window to prevent cysts from developing. Here, we show that enhanced PC2-expression is common in tissues that are mutants, in part due to an increase in Pkd2 mRNA. However, our data also suggest that more effective protein folding (protein folding) contribute to the increased levels of CHD2. We demonstrate that unfolded protein response is activated in knockout kidneys and in cells with mutant cells. GRP94 is found to physically interact with PC2, and depletion or chemical inhibition of the protein led to decreased PC2. Moreover, gp94 can be acetylated and attaches with HDAC6 (HDAC6), an enzyme and activator of HSP90. Inhibition of this enzyme decreases CAMP (an enzyme that acts as an inhibitor of cAMP)-related protein. Lastly, the authors showed that blocking the growth of cyst growth in vitro. Taken together, their data uncovered an important axis that likely plays an active role in maintaining elevated PC3 levels in pkgd1-mutant cell.","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD1) is a common inherited kidney disorder that results from mutations in either PKD2 (a protein that encodes a specific protein) or PK-1 (PC1), respectively.

This suggests that the amount of PC1 and PC2 needs to be maintained within a tight functional window to prevent cystogenesis. Here, researchers show that enhanced PC 2 expression is common in PKd1 mutant tissues, in part due to an increase in Pkd2 mRNA. However, the data also suggest that more effective protein folding contributes to the increased levels of proteins. The unfolded protein response is activated in knockout kidneys and in mutant cells. Additionally, this is coupled with increased amounts of GRP94, an endoplasmic reticulum protein, a member of a family of chaperones called HSP90 (an enzyme that helps control the release and release of energy from the body's cells) that are proteins that play a major role in regulating the protein levels in the blood. Inhibition of HDAC6 led to a decrease in PC3. Lastly, scientists showed that slowing or stopping the slowing of GPM94 prevents cAMP-induced cystic formation in vitro. Taken together, these findings reveal a new HMP90-related axis that likely participates in maintaining elevated (increased) PC-levels in a mutant (pregnant) cell.","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common inherited kidney disorder that results from mutations in either PKD1 (PKD1), a protein involved in the development of the kidneys, or Pkd2, another protein. Downregulation or overexpression (overproduction) of either of these proteins in mouse models results in kidney cyst formation, suggesting that the quantity of PC1 and PC2 needs to be maintained within a tight functional window to prevent cystogenesis. Here, we show that enhanced PC2-expression is common in tissues that have been genetically altered to have ADPKD. However, our data also suggest that more effective protein folding contributes to the increased levels of protein 2. We demonstrate that unfolded protein response is activated in kidneys that do not respond to a specific protein, and in cells that respond differently to different proteins. GRP94, an endoplasmic reticulum (ERI) protein that is part of a family of proteins called chaperones, is found to interact with PC2, and this interaction leads to an increase in PC2. Additionally, the protein is acetylated (deformed) and binds to histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which is known for its role in regulating protein levels. Inhibition of HDAC6 decreased PC-protein interaction and reduced PC-2 suggesting the two proteins work together to regulate the amount. Lastly, researchers showed that inhibition of an ERI protein prevents cAMP (a type of chemical released during cell division)-induced cyst creation in lab animals. Taken together, this study shows that a new interaction between two ERIs likely participates in maintaining elevated PC2/PC2 levels in Pksd1 mutant cells.","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (a disease inherited from both parents) is a common inherited kidney disorder that results from mutations in either PKD1 (PC1) or PKd2, which encode monoclonal antibodies (proteins that protect cells from infection) and poly Cystin-2 (pc2), respectively. Downregulation or overexpression of PKC1 orPKD2 in mouse models results in kidney cyst formation. This suggests that the amount of PC1 and PC2 needs to be maintained within a tight functional window to prevent cysts. Here, we show that enhanced (increased) PC 2 expression is common feature of Pkd1 mutant tissues, in part due to an increase in the mRNA (genetic material) of the protein. However, our data also suggest that more effective protein folding contributes to the increased levels ofPC2. We demonstrate that unfolded protein response (the folding of proteins to create a new molecule, called unfolded-response), is activated in cells that have not received the kidney protein and that this is coupled with increased amounts of GRP94, an endoplasmic reticulum protein, that is part of a family of chaperones (cells that act as a barrier between cells and the outside world) that helps protect the inner parts of cells. GRp94 was found to physically interact with PC3 and depletion or chemical (mechanical) inhibition led to a decrease (decrease) in PC4, suggesting that GR P94 serves as the body's protective layer. Also, GR p94 is acetylated and binds to histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a known protein-folding enzyme and activator of HSP90 proteins. Inhibition (removal of activity) by HDAC 6 decreased PC0 suggesting the two proteins work together (coordinate with each other to regulate PC levels) to maintain high levels. Lastly, the authors showed that stopping or stopping GRPs94 prevents cAMP (anti-inflammatory molecule) formation in vitro (in lab experiments). Taken together, these data uncovered a novel (unrelated to one another) gene-related axis that likely helps maintain elevated (excess) levels in Ppd 1 mutant cells in PKK1 damaged or missing kidneys. The data shows that in this study, there is an additional gene involved in maintaining elevated levels (amount of protein in a cell's blood stream)."
20,33404081,"Objective: Since several recent meta-analyses report a dose-response relationship for the antidepressant effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), we investigated how these drugs are dosed in clinical practice. Methods: Through linkage of nation- or region-wide registers, we describe SSRI doses in 50,365 individuals residing in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden, with an incident diagnosis of depression and initiating SSRI treatment between 2007 and 2016.

40,21944912,"Objectives: This study was conducted to define bandage pressures that are safe and effective in treating leg ulcers of mixed arterial-venous etiology. Methods: In 25 patients with mixed-etiology leg ulcers who received inelastic bandages applied with pressures from 20 to 30, 31 to 40, and 41 to 50 mm Hg, the following measurements were performed before and after bandage application to ensure patient safety throughout the investigation: laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF) close to the ulcer under the bandage and at the great toe, transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPo(2)) on the dorsum of the foot, and toe pressure. Ejection fraction (EF) of the venous pump was performed to assess efficacy on venous hemodynamics. Results: LDF values under the bandages increased by 33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17-48; P < .01), 28% (95% CI, 12-45; P < .05), and 10% (95% CI, -7 to 28), respectively, under the three pressure ranges applied. At toe level, a significant decrease in flux of -20% (95% CI, -48 to 9; P < .05) was seen when bandage pressure >41 mm Hg. Toe pressure values and TcPo(2) showed a moderate increase, excluding a restriction to arterial perfusion induced by the bandages. Inelastic bandages were highly efficient in improving venous pumping function, increasing the reduced ejection fraction by 72% (95% CI, 50%-95%; P < .001) under pressure of 21 to 30 mm Hg and by 103% (95% CI, 70%-128%; P < .001) at 31 to 40 mm Hg. Conclusions: In patients with mixed ulceration, an ankle-brachial pressure index >0.5 and an absolute ankle pressure of >60 mm Hg, inelastic compression of up to 40 mm Hg does not impede arterial perfusion but may lead to a normalization of the highly reduced venous pumping function.

The study evaluated 25 patients with leg ulcers who received inelastic bandages applied with various pressures (20 to 30, 31 to 40, and 41 to 50 mm Hg). Several measurements were performed before and after bandage application to ensure patient safety throughout the investigation. These measurements included laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF), transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPo(2)), and toe pressure. LDF measures blood flow. TcPO2 measures oxygen in the skin. Ejection fraction (EF) of the venous pump, or the blood flowing from the heart, was performed to assess blood flow from the heart every time it contracts. LDF values under the bandages increased at all three pressure ranges. At toe level, a significant decrease in flux (blood buildup) was seen when bandage pressure was >41 mm Hg. Toe pressure values and TcPo(2) moderately increased. Inelastic bandages were highly efficient in improving venous pumping function. This is when a machine compresses veins to force blood flow to the heart. The study concluded that patients with mixed ulceration using inelastic compression of up to 40 mm Hg do not experience impeded (blocked) arterial perfusion. Arterial perfusion is when a patient has their blood drawn, has the blood mixed with medication, and has the blood pumped back into the host. However, this inelastic compression may lead to a regularly decreased venous pumping function.

Safety was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue and headache. Compared to other viral vaccines, the risk of serious side effects was low and was similar in both groups. Two-doses of vaccine gave 95% protection against COvid19. Safety over a median of 2 months is similar to that of other virus vaccines.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (Covid-19) is a viral, breathing-related disease and has affected tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. In an ongoing, multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). The vaccine is made of a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a stabilized, membrane-anchored, full-length spike protein. The primary end points are the success of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid 19 and safety. A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization (randomization) of injections: 21,720 (with the vaccination) with BNNT162B2 and 21-728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covids with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to get BNBT162a2, and 162 cases among the placebo group. B NBT2 was 95% effective (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine success (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index (a measure of body mass), and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases with severe CovIDs, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in B ntnnty vaccine recipient. Safety was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue and headache. Serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccinated and placebo groups. Conclusions: A two-dose regimen of Bnbt2 protected 95 percent of patients from CovIDS in those who received it in their 16th and 17th years. Patient safety over a median of 2 months is similar to that of other viral vaccines."

41,34155062,"Background: In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), cyst development and enlargement lead to ESKD. Macrophage recruitment and interstitial inflammation promote cyst growth. TWEAK is a TNF superfamily (TNFSF) cytokine that regulates inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, and cell death, and its receptor Fn14 (TNFRSF12a) is expressed in macrophage and nephron epithelia. Methods: To evaluate the role of the TWEAK signaling pathway in cystic disease, we evaluated Fn14 expression in human and in an orthologous murine model of ADPKD. We also explored the cystic response to TWEAK signaling pathway activation and inhibition by peritoneal injection. Results: Meta-analysis of published animal-model data of cystic disease reveals mRNA upregulation of several components of the TWEAK signaling pathway. We also observed that TWEAK and Fn14 were overexpressed in mouse ADPKD kidney cysts, and TWEAK was significantly high in urine and cystic fluid from patients with ADPKD. TWEAK administration induced cystogenesis and increased cystic growth, worsening the phenotype in a murine ADPKD model. Anti-TWEAK antibodies significantly slowed the progression of ADPKD, preserved renal function, and improved survival. Furthermore, the anti-TWEAK cystogenesis reduction is related to decreased cell proliferation-related MAPK signaling, decreased NF-κB pathway activation, a slight reduction of fibrosis and apoptosis, and an indirect decrease in macrophage recruitment. Conclusions: This study identifies the TWEAK signaling pathway as a new disease mechanism involved in cystogenesis and cystic growth and may lead to a new therapeutic approach in ADPKD.","In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), an inherited disorder that causes cysts (growths) in the kidneys, cyst development and enlargement lead to end-stage kidney disease. The recruitment of macrophage cells (a type of white blood cell that surrounds and kills microorganisms, removes dead cells, and activates other immune system cells) and spaces between the kidney becoming swollen are found to promote cyst growth. TWEAK is a type of cytokine (chemical messenger) that regulates inflammatory (infection-fighting) responses, cell growth and division, and cell death. Its receptor Fn14 (TNFRSF12a) that sends and receives signals is expressed in macrophages and a layer of outer lining cells in the kidney called nephron epithelia. To evaluate how the TWEAK cytokine signaling plays a role in cystic disease, researchers evaluate the Fn14 gene development in humans and in experiments with animals of ADPKD. Researchers also looked at the response from cysts to the activation of TWEAK signaling as well as its limited signaling by injections. Data published from animal studies of cystic disease show increases in mRNA (genetic strands with instructions to build proteins) of several parts of the TWEAK signaling pathway. Researchers also found that too many TWEAK and Fn14 gene-derived molecules are in made in mouse ADPKD kidney cysts, and TWEAK is very high in the urine and cystic fluid from patients with ADPKD. TWEAK use started formation of cysts and increased cystic growth, worsening physical traits in an animal ADPKD model. Anti-TWEAK antibodies (a protein used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as harmful bacteria and viruses) significantly slowed the progression of ADPKD, protected kidney function, and improved survival. Additionally, the reduction of cyst formation is related to decreased cell growth and a decrease in macrophage recruitment. In conclusion, this study identifies the TWEAK signaling pathway as a new disease process involved in the growth and formation of many cysts and may lead to a new treatment approach in ADPKD.",,"In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), cyst development and enlargement lead to ESKD.

To evaluate the role of the TweAK signaling pathway in cystic disease, this study evaluated expression in human and in an orthologous murine model of dyne disease. We also explored the cyst response to activating and blocking by peritoneal injection (injected into the bladder) injection. The study also observed that both of these two genes were overexpressed in mouse kidney cysts and was significantly high in urine and cyst fluid from patients with DDK. Treatment with anti-tweak antibodies significantly slowed the progression of DK, preserved kidney function and improved survival. In addition, the reduction of cystogenesis reduction is related to decreased cell growth-related MAPK signals, decreased NF-B pathway activation (activation) pathway (increased fibrosis (swelling of cells), and an indirect decrease in cell recruitment.

We also explored how the immune system responds to a certain pathway activation and inhibition by peritoneal injection. Analysis of published animal-model data shows changes in several key signaling pathways. Researchers also observed that certain signaling molecules were overexpressed in mouse ADPKDs kidney cytches. A specific pathway was significantly high in urine and fluid from patients with the disease. Treating the Cystic response with Treatments induced cyctogenesis and increased cytic growth. These changes worsened the phenotype in a mouse model. Anti-Treat antibodies (antibodies that target specific proteins) significantly slowed the progression of ADPD, preserved kidney function (redness and swelling from fighting an infection), and improved survival. Furthermore, the reduction in anti-treatants is related to decreased cell proliferation-related MAPK signaling, decreased NF-κB signaling activation, a slight reduction of fibrosis (fibrosis and apoptosis) and an indirect decrease in immune cells.

Analysis of published animal-model data reveals mRNA (genetic material) upregulation (increase in activity) of several components (substances in the body that are involved in cell growth, signaling, or signaling to other cells). The analysis also shows that Ttwaak and Fn14 are overexpressed (expressed more than the amount of a protein in a cell's messenger messenger, NF-κB, in humans and mice, respectively) and are found to be very high in urine (blood) from patients with AD PKD. In addition to this, Tweedak administration (treatment) causes cyostogenesis and increased cyast growth (growth of an organ or tissue in which the cells are unable to turn urine into energy).
