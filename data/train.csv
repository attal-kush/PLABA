46,33805605,"Cystic fibrosis is a monogenic, autosomal, recessive disease characterized by an alteration of chloride transport caused by mutations in the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene. The loss of Phe residue in position 508 (ΔF508-CFTR) causes an incorrect folding of the protein causing its degradation and electrolyte imbalance. CF patients are extremely predisposed to the development of a chronic inflammatory process of the bronchopulmonary system. When the cells of a tissue are damaged, the immune cells are activated and trigger the production of free radicals, provoking an inflammatory process. In addition to routine therapies, today drugs called correctors are available for mutations such as ΔF508-CFTR as well as for others less frequent ones. These active molecules are supposed to facilitate the maturation of the mutant CFTR protein, allowing it to reach the apical membrane of the epithelial cell. Matrine induces ΔF508-CFTR release from the endoplasmic reticulum to cell cytosol and its localization on the cell membrane. We now have evidence that Matrine and Lumacaftor not only restore the transport of mutant CFTR protein, but probably also counteract the inflammatory process by improving the course of the disease.","Cystic fibrosis is a deadly disease inherited from both parents characterized by changes in a compound (chloride) movement caused by genetic changes in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. One gene change, ΔF508-CFTR, causes the resulting protein the gene creates to fold incorrectly, which leads to its destruction and mineral imbalance. CF patients are at very high risk of developing long-term inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) of part of the lungs. When tissue cells are damaged, immune cells are stimulated and produce unstable molecules, prompting the immune system to defend the body. In addition to normal treatments, drugs called correctors are available for changes like ΔF508-CFTR and other less common changes. Correctors help the CFTR protein form the right shape to move to the surface of the epithelial cell (cell that covers outer surface of the internal organs). Matrine, a drug, starts ΔF508-CFTR release from the cell's transportation system through the cell liquid to the surface. We now have proof that Matrine and Lumacaftor, another drug, not only allow the changed CFTR to move, but probably neutralize inflammation by improving the course of the disease.",
55,16935966,"Evidence is put forward to suggest that myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, may be associated with persistent viral infection. In turn, such infections are likely to impair the ability of the body to biosynthesise n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids by inhibiting the delta-6 desaturation of the precursor essential fatty acids--namely, alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid. This would, in turn, impair the proper functioning of cell membranes, including cell signalling, and have an adverse effect on the biosynthesis of eicosanoids from the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. These actions might offer an explanation for some of the symptoms and signs of myalgic encephalomyelitis. A potential therapeutic avenue could be offered by bypassing the inhibition of the enzyme delta-6-desaturase by treatment with virgin cold-pressed non-raffinated evening primrose oil, which would supply gamma-linolenic acid and lipophilic pentacyclic triterpenes, and with eicosapentaenoic acid. The gamma-linolenic acid can readily be converted into dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and thence arachidonic acid, while triterpenes have important free radical scavenging, cyclo-oxygenase and neutrophil elastase inhibitory activities. Furthermore, both arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid are, at relatively low concentrations, directly virucidal.","Scientific evidence suggests that myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome or long-lasting tiredness, may be associated with persistent viral infection. These infections may impair the body's ability to biosynthesize (create) fatty acids by inhibiting (blocking) the enzymatic reaction associated with essential fatty acids. This would, in turn, impair the proper functioning of cell membranes (cell boundaries), including cell signaling, and have an adverse effect on the biosynthesis of signaling molecules. These actions might offer an explanation for some of the symptoms and signs of myalgic encephalomyelitis. A potential treatment could be found in virgin cold-pressed primrose oil. The oil would supply gamma-linolenic acid and lipophilic pentacyclic triterpenes (specific fatty substances). The resulting acid and triterpenes would be further converted into beneficial compounds. Furthermore, the resulting compounds are virucidal or can destroy inactive viruses.",
21,28828685,"Purpose: Hiatal hernias are a common finding on radiographic or endoscopic studies. Hiatal hernias may become symptomatic or, less frequently, can incarcerate or become a volvulus leading to organ ischemia. This review examines latest evidence on the diagnostic workup and management of hiatal hernias. Methods: A literature review of contemporary and latest studies with highest quality of evidence was completed. This information was examined and compiled in review format. Results: Asymptomatic hiatal and paraesophageal hernias become symptomatic and necessitate repair at a rate of 1% per year. Watchful waiting is appropriate for asymptomatic hernias. Symptomatic hiatal hernias and those with confirmed reflux disease require operative repair with an anti-reflux procedure. Key operative steps include the following: reduction and excision of hernia sac, 3 cm of intraabdominal esophageal length, crural closure with mesh reinforcement, and an anti-reflux procedure. Repairs not amenable to key steps may undergo gastropexy and gastrostomy placement as an alternative procedure. Conclusions: Hiatal hernias are commonly incidental findings. When hernias become symptomatic or have reflux disease, an operative repair is required. A minimally invasive approach is safe and has improved outcomes.","Hiatal hernias, which occur when the upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm into the chest, are often found by x-ray and using a long, thin tube with a camera to look inside the body. Hiatal hernias may cause symptoms or, less often, can become trapped or twisted, cutting off blood flow to organs. This review looks at the latest studies on the diagnosis and treatment of hiatal hernias. We reviewed the strongest current and most recent studies. We studied this information and put it in an easily reviewable format. We found that hiatal hernias without symptoms develop symptoms and need repair at a rate of 1% per year. Watching without treatment unless symptoms appear or change is suggested for people with hernias with no symptoms. Hiatal hernias with symptoms and those with stomach acid reflux disease need surgery with an anti-reflux procedure. Surgery has key steps. When these key steps can't be done, stitching the stomach to the diaphragm and inserting a feeding tube is another option. We conclude that hiatal hernias are often found when looking for something else. When hernias cause symptoms or have reflux disease, surgery is needed. A minimally invasive treatment is safe and has improved results.","Hiatal hernias, in which the stomach bulges into the chest, are common clinical findings. Hiatal hernias can lead to unwanted symptoms, trapped or twisted intestines, and reduced blood flow to certain body parts. This review examines the latest works on identifying and managing these stomach bulges into the chest.  No-symptom stomach or organ bulges into the chest acquire symptoms and need repair at a rate of 1% per year. Watchful waiting is appropriate for these no-symptom organ bulges into the chest. Hiatal hernias with unwanted symptoms and stomach acid reflux into throat need special, anti-reflux surgery. Key surgery steps include: cutting out the bulging sac, 3 cm of the lower esophagus, closing the site with mesh, and an anti-acid reflux operation. Repairs not possible with common surgery may need stitching and opening of the stomach instead. Hiatal hernias are common. When organ bulges lead to awful symptoms or stomach acid reflux, surgery is needed. A small incision surgery is safe and has improved outcomes."
36,32809722,"Renal stones pose a significant burden on the health care system. The prevalence of renal stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the United States, with annual healthcare costs of USD 3.8 billion. It is estimated that more than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone problems. The most common presenting symptoms include hematuria, pain in the flank, groin, or abdomen. There are many treatment modalities available for managing renal stones. They range from completely non-invasive outpatient procedures to invasive procedures requiring hospital admission and increased risks of complications. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a truly non-invasive procedure as opposed to other surgical treatments used, such as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). The efficacy of ESWL lies in its ability to pulverize calculi in vivo into smaller segments, which are them expelled spontaneously by the boy. Shockwaves are generated and are then focused on a point within the body. The shockwaves propagate through the body with minimal dissipation of energy (and therefore damage) due to minimal difference in density of the soft tissues. At the stone fluid interface, a relatively significant difference in density, combined with a large concentration of multiple shockwaves in a small area, produces a significant dissipation of energy. Through the different mechanisms, this energy can overcome the tensile strength of the stone resulting in fragmentation. Repetition of this process leads to the pulverization of the stone into small fragments that the body then can pass painlessly and spontaneously.","Kidney stones are a major burden on health care. The proportion of cases of kidney stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the United States, with yearly healthcare costs of 3.8 billion US dollars. More than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone issues. The most common symptoms are blood in the urine and pain at or near the abdomen. There are many treatment options for kidney stones. They range from non-surgical away-from-hospital treatments to surgical procedures needing hospital care and increased risks of side effects. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), or kidney stone removal with shockwaves, is a truly non-srugical procedure compared to other surgical treatments like kidney surgery with a camera tube and making a small skin cut to remove stones. The success of ESWL comes from pulverizing stones into small stones, which are removed naturally by the body. Shockwaves are created and focused on a point in the body. The shockwaves spread through the body with minimal loss of energy (and therefore damage) due to small density or hardness differences of the surrounding body parts. At the boundary between the stone and body fluid, a large difference in hardness, along with many shockwaves in one area, creates a large burst of energy. Via different mechanisms, this energy can break up the stone. Repeating this process pulverzies the stone into small fragments that the body can remove painlessly and naturally.","Kidney stones are a major burden on the health care system. The number of kidney stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the United States, and yearly healthcare costs are at $3.8 billion. It is estimated that more than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone problems. The most common symptoms include blood in the urine, pain in the back and sides, groin, or stomach area (abdomen). There are many treatment methods available for managing kidney stones. These options range from non-invasive (non-surgical) outpatient procedures that do not require hospital stays to invasive (surgical) procedures requiring staying in the hospital and an increased risk of complications. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a truly non-invasive procedure as opposed to other surgical treatments used, such as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) that require an incision into the skin. ESWL is effective because it can crush stones inside the body into smaller parts, which are then released from the body when going to the bathroom. Shockwaves are generated and focused on a point within the body. The shockwaves go through the body with little damage to surrounding tissues. When the stone changes, there is a big difference in the density of the stone which may produce a larger reach of energy due to a lot of shockwaves in a small area of the body. This energy can overpower the strength of the stone, resulting in breaking the stone into smaller parts. Repeating this process leads to the pulverizing of the stone into small fragments that the body can then pass through the body with no pain."
11,32654164,"Metabolic epilepsies arise in the context of rare inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), notably glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, and mitochondrial cytopathies. A common feature of these disorders is impaired bioenergetics, which through incompletely defined mechanisms result in a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, such as epileptic seizures, developmental delay, and movement disorders. The ketogenic diet (KD) has been successfully utilized to treat such conditions to varying degrees. While the mechanisms underlying the clinical efficacy of the KD in IEM remain unclear, it is likely that the proposed heterogeneous targets influenced by the KD work in concert to rectify or ameliorate the downstream negative consequences of genetic mutations affecting key metabolic enzymes and substrates-such as oxidative stress and cell death. These beneficial effects can be broadly grouped into restoration of impaired bioenergetics and synaptic dysfunction, improved redox homeostasis, anti-inflammatory, and epigenetic activity. Hence, it is conceivable that the KD might prove useful in other metabolic disorders that present with epileptic seizures. At the same time, however, there are notable contraindications to KD use, such as fatty acid oxidation disorders. Clearly, more research is needed to better characterize those metabolic epilepsies that would be amenable to ketogenic therapies, both experimentally and clinically. In the end, the expanded knowledge base will be critical to designing metabolism-based treatments that can afford greater clinical efficacy and tolerability compared to current KD approaches, and improved long-term outcomes for patients.","Metabolic epilepsies (a disorder that disturbs brain and nerve activity and causes seizures) are present with rare, inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), especially with deficiencies of certain energy-monitoring molecules. These disorders commonly include weakened energy-monitoring processes, which lead to a range of nerve-related effects, including epileptic seizures, growth delay, and movement disorders. The ketogenic diet (KD) (a low-carb diet) has successfully treated these conditions to some effect. While the reasons for the usefulness of KD or low-carb diets in inborn errors of metabolism is unclear, it may be because certain targets of KD work together to improve the negative effects from gene sequence changes affecting key metabolic particles, cell stress, and cell death. These helpful effects can be grouped into restoration of weakened energy-monitoring processes and nerve-related damage, improved electrical balance, anti-inflammation, and gene-related activity. Therefore, it is possible that KD may help other metabolic disorders with epileptic seizures. However, there are issues with KD use, including fat breakdown disorders. More research is needed to explain metabolic epilepsies (disorders that disturbe brain and nerve activity and cause seizures) that may be treated with low-carb treatments. Ultimately, this new knowledge will be useful to design metabolic treatments that can further help patients compared to current KD approaches, with better long-term outcomes for patients.","Metabolic epilepsies (seizures) arise in the context of rare hereditary or inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and can be caused in rare disorders. A common feature of these disorders is they cause brain-related symptoms, such as epileptic seizures, developmental delay (delays in reaching language, thinking, social, or motor skills), and movement disorders. The ketogenic diet, a low-carb/high-fat diet, has been successfully used to treat such conditions. How a ketogenic diet exactly impacts inborn errors of metabolism is not known, but it is likely that they influence the negative impacts of genetic mutations. Benefits of a ketogenic diet are broadly grouped into restoration of parts of metabolism that are impaired, improved maintenance of cells and cells processes, reduced pain and swelling, and processes that control gene activity without changing the DNA. It is possible that a ketogenic diet may be useful in other disorders of metabolism that include epileptic seizures. At the same time, there are some disorders where ketogenic diets should be avoided. More research is needed to better describe metabolic epilepsies that would benefit from a ketogenic diet. Expanding knowledge will be important to design metabolism-based treatments."
23,24882081,"Detection of individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessively inherited disorder in phenylalanine degradation, is straightforward and efficient due to newborn screening programs. A recent introduction of the pharmacological treatment option emerged rapid development of molecular testing. However, variants responsible for PKU do not all suppress enzyme activity to the same extent. A spectrum of over 850 variants, gives rise to a continuum of hyperphenylalaninemia from very mild, requiring no intervention, to severe classical PKU, requiring urgent intervention. Locus-specific and genotypes database are today an invaluable resource of information for more efficient classification and management of patients. The high-tech molecular methods allow patients' genotype to be obtained in a few days, especially if each laboratory develops a panel for the most frequent variants in the corresponding population.","Checks for conditions that affect newborns make finding individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), a disorder inherited from both parents in which the body cannot properly turn a substance (phenylalanine) into energy, easy and effective. A recent drug treatment option brought fast development of a lab method that checks for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules that may be a sign of a disease. However, genetic alternations that cause PKU do not equally reduce protein activity. A range of over 850 genetic alterations causes elevated phenylalanine blood levels from very mild with no treatment to severe PKU, which needs immediate treatment. Databases of physical gene locations and alterations carried in a gene allow effective classification and treatment of patients. The lab method that checks for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules determines a patient's genetic alterations in a few days, especially if each lab comes up with a test to look for alterations in more than one gene for the most common alterations in a group of people.",
13,24088747,"Objective: Nighttime onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) is sometimes associated with obstructive sleep apnea accompanied by a characteristic heart rate (HR) pattern known as cyclical variation of HR. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether cyclical variation of HR is prevalent in patients with nocturnal AF. Methods: The subjects consisted of 34 patients (68±12 years) with paroxysmal AF, including 14 patients with daytime AF and 20 patients with nighttime AF. Holter electrocardiogram (ECGs) were examined for the presence of cyclical variation in HR and to quantify the HR variability within the 40-minute period preceding each AF episode using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods. Results: Cyclical variation in HR was observed in 12 of 20 (60%) nighttime episodes and in only two of 14 (14%) daytime episodes. The prevalence of cyclical variation in HR was significantly greater in the nighttime AF episodes than in the daytime AF episodes (Chi=5.34, p<0.05). The mean frequency of cyclical variation in HR was 0.015±0.003 Hz. The mean power of the VLF (very low frequency) component (0.008-0.04 Hz) before the onset of AF was significantly greater in the nighttime AF episodes than in the daytime AF episodes. Among the nighttime AF episodes, the power of the HF (high frequency), LF (low frequency) and very low frequency (VLF) components increased significantly just before the onset of AF compared with that observed 40 minutes before onset. Conclusion: The high prevalence of cyclical variation in HR observed before nocturnal AF episodes suggests that sleep apnea may play a role in the onset of nighttime AF.","Nighttime onset of atrial fibrillation (a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots or stroke) is sometimes associated with obstructive sleep apnea (where muscles in the throat relax, the airway is narrowed or closed, and breathing is momentarily cut off) along with a specific heart rate pattern called cyclical variation. This study determines whether cyclical variation of heart rate is common in patients with nighttime atrial fibrillation (AF). There are 34 patients in the study with paroxysmal AF (when the heart rate returns to normal within 7 days on its own or with treatment), including 14 patients with daytime AF and 20 patients with nighttime AF. The presence of cyclical variation in heart rate is examined, and the heart rate differences are measured and counted 40 minutes before each AF episode. Cyclical variation in heart rate is found in 12 of 20 (60%) nighttime episodes and only in two of 14 (14%) daytime episodes. Cyclical variation in heart rate was much greater in the nighttime AF than in daytime AF episodes.  The high presence of cyclical variation in heart rate found before nighttime atrial fibrillation episodes suggests that sleep apnea may play a role in the onset of nighttime atrial fibrillation.",
49,26692738,"46 year old male with past medical history of schizoaffective disorder and chronic lower back pain, was admitted for management of worsening depression and anxiety. He was started on gabapentin, 300mg twice daily for his back pain and anxiety symptoms. His only other medication was hydrocodone. Over next few days, he started developing worsening bilateral lower extremity edema. He did not have any cardiovascular related symptoms. Physical exam was only significant for 3+ pitting edema with all laboratory values and imaging being unremarkable. Gabapentin was discontinued and his lower extremity swelling improved over subsequent days. Incidence of pedal edema with gabapentin use is approximately 7 to 7.5% with all studies being in elderly patients receiving doses above 1200 mg/day. This case illustrates that lower doses of gabapentin can also cause this adverse effect. It is important to recognize this adverse effect because gabapentin is used in conditions like diabetic neuropathy, which is associated with multiple co-morbidities that can give rise to bilateral leg swelling. Presence of gabapentin induced leg swelling can thus confound the clinical picture.","A 46 year old male with past medical history of schizoaffective (reality-distorting) disorder, a mental disorder, and chronic lower back pain, is admitted to a medical facility to manage worsening depression and anxiety. He is started on a medicine called gabapentin (nerve pain medication) for his back pain and anxiety symptoms. His only other medication is an opioid pain reliever called hydrocodone. Over the next few days, he starts developing worsening edema, swelling caused by too much fluid trapped in the body's tissues, in both legs. He does not have any cardiovascular (heart) related symptoms. A physical exam found pitting edema, where pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation. All other lab tests and imaging scans did not show anything significant. Gabapentin is stopped and the swelling in his legs improved over the following days. In other studies, the occurrence of swollen feet (pedal edema) while on gabapentin is about 7 to 7.5% in elderly patients receiving doses above 1200 mg/day. This case illustrates that lower doses of gabapentin can also cause this negative effect. It is important to recognize this negative effect because gabapentin is used in conditions like nerve damage common with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), which is associated with multiple illnesses that can give rise to swelling in both legs. ","We admitted a 46 year old male to treat his worsening depression and anxiety. He had a prior history of symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorders and long-lasting lower back pain. He was started on gabapentin (nerve pain medication), 300 mg twice daily for his back pain and anxiety symptoms. His only other medication was hydrocodone, a pain and cough medication. Over the next few days, he developed worsening swelling in both legs. He did not have any heart-related symptoms. Physical exam only noted serious swelling with all lab values and imaging not being serious. Gabapentin use was stopped, and his leg swelling improved over the next few days. Frequency of leg swelling with gabapentin use is around 7 to 7.5% with all studies being in elderly patients receiving doses above 1200 mg/day. This case shows that lower doses of gabapentin can also cause this harmful effect. This serious effect should be noted since gabapentin is used in conditions like diabetic nerve pain, which is linked with other diseases that can give rise to swelling in both legs. Presence of gabapentin-caused leg swelling can thus confuse the diagnosis."
33,28070716,"Pharmacokinetic data of gabapentin (GBP) in community-dwelling elderly patients show a significant effect of advanced age on GBP pharmacokinetics due to altered renal function. However, there are no data in elderly nursing home (NH) patients to evaluate gabapentin absorption and elimination. Our objective was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of GBP in elderly nursing home patients maintained on GBP therapy. This was a prospective pharmacokinetic study in elderly nursing home patients (≥60 years) receiving GBP for the management of chronic pain or epilepsy from seven nursing homes. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. A one-compartment model described the data and clearance (CL) was associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p < 0.0001). The GBP CL in elderly nursing home patients was 2.93 L/h. After adjusting for the effect of GFR, GBP CL was not affected by age, sex, body weight, or comorbidity scores. No significant effects of body size measures, age, and sex were detected on volume of distribution. Dose-dependent bioavailability of GBP was demonstrated, and the saturable absorption profile was described by a nonlinear hyperbolic function. Prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pc-VPC) suggests adequate fixed- and random-effects models that successfully simulated the mean trend and variability in gabapentin concentration-time profiles. In this analysis, the parameters of the hyperbolic nonlinearity appear to be similar between elderly and younger adults.","Data on how gabapentin (GBP -a nerve-related pain medication) is used in the body in elderly patients show a major effect of older age on how the drug works due to changes in kidney function. However, there are no data in elderly nursing home patients to evaluate how the body absorbs and removes gabapentin. The objective of this study is to describe how the body uses and processes gabapentin in elderly nursing home patients who are on gabapentin. This study observed elderly nursing home patients (≥60 years) receiving gabapentin for chronic (ongoing) pain or epilepsy (seizure disorders) from 7 nursing homes. Data on gabapentin and the clearance of the drug are associated with the rate that measures how well the kidneys are working. The gabapentin clearance in elderly nursing home patients was 2.93 liters per hour. After accounting for the rate that measures how well the kidneys are working, GBP clearance is not affected by age, sex, body weight, or other illnesses and their medications. No significant effects of body size measures, age, and sex are detected on volume of distribution, the ability of various drugs to distribute through the body fluids. The availability of the drug being dependent on dosage is shown, and how it is absorbed is calculated. Additional calculations are done on the entire group to evaluate the performance of the drug and identify other individual factors that may impact the effect. In this analysis, the patterns of the drug appear to be similar between elderly and younger adults.","Drug activity data of gabapentin (GBP) in community-dwelling elderly patients show a great effect of advanced age on GVP drug activity due to altered kidney function.

This is a drug actvity study in elderly nursing home patients (≥60 years) given GBP for long-term pain or epilepsy (brain disorder causing seizures) from seven nursing homes. A mathematical model showed the data and clearance (CL) was linked with estimated kidney filtration rate. The GBP clearance in elderly nursing home patients was 2.93 liters/hour. After adjusting for kidney filtration, GBP clearance was not affected by age, sex, body weight, or associated diseases. No effects of body size, age, and sex were detected on amount of distribution. Functional or active GBP amount is linked to dose amount. Analysis suggests certain mathematical models successfully tracked the trend and variation in gabapentin amount over time. In this analysis, certain measures seem similar between elderly and young adults."
30,33368332,"Diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) cases is based on the count of real-time reverse transcription-plymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive people. Viral load by real-time RT-PCR has been suggested as a biomarker of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the association of viral load and severity of the disease is not yet resolved. Nasopharyngeal samples from 458 patients were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Relative quantitation was made by the comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCt ) formula between ORF1ab viral and RNase P housekeeping genes. Absolute viral load was calculate using a reference positive control. Most prevalent clinical signs were cough (75.8%), myalgia (66.7%), and fever (48.5%). Hypertension (18.2%), neurological diseases (15.1%), and asthma and hypothyroidism (12.1%) were most frequent comorbidities. Fever, either as an exclusive symptom or combined with others, was associated with high viral loads ( 2−ΔΔCt range, 35.65-155.16; 4.25-4.89 log10 RNA copies/test]). During the first week after onset of symptoms in mild patients up to 60 years-old was detected the peak of viral load. Children under 10 years old have a high viral load (313.84; 2.50) in the first 2 days postinfection with a sharp decline thereafter. Cases between 10 and 49 years old mostly showed low and moderate viral load during the first 2 days postinfection (range, 0.03 to 17.24; -1.50 to 1.24). Patients over 60 years old have high viral load up to the second week after the onset of symptoms (range, 25.32-155.42; 1.40-2.19), indicating the longer presence of the virus in them. These findings suggest the viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs would help to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 infection in mild coronavirus disease 2019 cases.","Diagnosis of cases of coronavirus (a virus causing the lung infection known as Covid-19) is based on the count of positive RT-PCR tests, a type of test that looks for traces of DNA from the virus and signals positive if there is virus present. The amount of virus in the body, called the viral load, measured by the RT-PCR test is seen as an indication of coronavirus infection. However, the association of the amount of virus and the severity of the disease is not yet understood. Samples from the back of the nose from 458 patients are tested by RT-PCR for coronavirus. Additional tests are done to measure the viral load. The most common signs are cough, muscle aches and pains, and fever. High blood pressure, diseases affecting the brain and nerves, asthma, and hypothyroidism (not enough thyroid hormone in the body) were the most frequent conditions of other illnesses. Fever, either as the only symptom or combined with others, is associated with high viral loads. During the first week after symptoms start in mild patients up to 60 years-old is the peak of viral load. Children under 10 years old have a high viral load in the first 2 days post-infection followed by a sharp decline. Cases between 10 and 49 years old mostly showed low and moderate viral load during the first 2 days after infection. Patients over 60 years old have high viral load up to the second week after the start of symptoms, indicating the virus stays present in them longer. These findings suggest the viral load in swabs from the nose would help to monitor the coronavirus infection in mild coronavirus disease 2019 cases.","Detecting cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), which causes a breathing-related viral disease, is based on the count of people which a certain molecular test (real-time RT-PCR) detects.

Nasal samples from 458 patients were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.  Most common symptoms were cough (75.8%), muscle pain (66.7%), and fever (48.5%). High blood pressure (18.2%), brain-related diseases (15.1%), and asthma and reduced thyroid function, which affects metabolism, (12.1%) were the most frequent associated conditions. Fever, either alone or with other symptoms, was linked with a high virus amount.

47,26783040,"Background: Low serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are a hallmark of hypophosphatasia. However, the clinical significance and the underlying genetics of low ALP in unselected populations are unclear. Methods: In order to clarify this issue, we performed a clinical, biochemical and genetic study of 42 individuals (age range 20-77yr) with unexplained low ALP levels. Results: Nine had mild hyperphosphatemia and three had mild hypercalcemia. ALP levels were inversely correlated with serum calcium (r=-0.38, p=0.012), pyridoxal phosphate (PLP; r=-0.51, p=0.001) and urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA; r=-0.49, p=0.001). Although many subjects experienced minor complaints, such as mild musculoskeletal pain, none had major health problems. Mutations in ALPL were found in 21 subjects (50%), including six novel mutations. All but one, were heterozygous mutations. Missense mutations were the most common (present in 18 subjects; 86%) and the majority were predicted to have a damaging effect on protein activity. The presence of a mutated allele was associated with tooth loss (48% versus 12%; p=0.04), slightly lower levels of serum ALP (p=0.002), higher levels of PLP (p<0.0001) and PEA (p<0.0001), as well as mildly increased serum phosphate (p=0.03). Ten individuals (24%) had PLP levels above the reference range; all carried a mutated allele. Conclusion: One-half of adult individuals with unexplained low serum ALP carried an ALPL mutation. Although the associated clinical manifestations are usually mild, in approximately 50% of the cases, enzyme activity is low enough to cause substrate accumulation and may predispose to defects in calcified tissues.","Low blood levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a protein that influences the high-energy molecule phosphate, indicates low blood phosphate levels. However, the importance and genetics of low ALP in random groups is unknown. To clarify this issue, we performed a clinical, biochemical and genetic study of 42 individuals with unexplained low ALP levels. Nine had mildly high blood phosphate levels. Three had mildly high blood calcium levels. ALP levels trended oppositely with blood calcium, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) or active vitamin B6, and urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA), a key molecule to build cell boundaries. Although many had minor complains, like mild musculoskeletal pain, none had major health problems. Gene sequence changes in ALPL, the gene encoding ALP, were found in 21 subjects (50%), including six new changes. Mutations that change a protein segment were the most common (present in 18 subjects; 86%). The majority were predicted to have a harmful effect on protein activity. Having a mutated gene was linked with tooth loss, slightly lower levels of blood ALP, higher levels of PLP and PEA, and mildly higher blood phosphate. Ten people had above-average PLP levels. All had a mutated gene. Half of the adults with unexplained low blood ALP had an ALPL mutation. Although the associated physical symptoms are usually mild, in around 50% of the cases, protein enzyme activity is low enough to cause phosphate accumulation and may predispose to defects in high-calcium body parts.","Low serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are a sign of hypophosphatasia (genetic disease that affects bone and tooth development). ALP is an enzyme that helps bone strength. However, the clinical significance and the underlying genetics of low ALP in unselected populations are unclear. To better understand this issue, the authors performed a study of 42 individuals with unexplained low ALP levels. The participants were between 20 to 77 years old. Nine had mild hyperphosphatemia (high serum phosphate) and three had mild hypercalcemia (high blood calcium). ALP levels were inversely related with serum calcium, pyridoxal phosphate, and urine phosphoethanolamine. These are all compounds within the body that play a role in bone health. Many subjects experienced minor complaints, such as mild muscle or bone pain. However, none had major health problems. Mutations in ALPL were found in 21 subjects, including six novel mutations. All but one were heterozygous mutations, which is a mutation only affecting one form of a gene. Missense mutations, or mistakes in the DNA, were the most common. Most of the mutations were predicted to have a damaging effect on protein activity. The presence of a mutated allele was associated with tooth loss, slightly lower levels of serum (blood) ALP, higher levels of PLP and PEA, as well as mildly increased serum phosphate. Ten individuals had PLP levels above the reference range. All carried a mutated allele or gene copy. One-half of adult individuals with unexplained low serum ALP carried an ALPL mutation. In almost half of the cases, enzyme activity is low enough to cause substrate (cell substance) accumulation. This may make an individual more likely to experience defects in calcified tissues, such as bone."
11,7853374,"Treatment of PDH deficiency rarely influences the course of the disease. It is usually possible to reverse or minimize systemic lactic acid accumulation by giving a high fat/low carbohydrate ""ketogenic"" diet, but this does not alleviate the neurological symptoms as structural damage in the brain is present from before birth and many patients do not have significant metabolic problems. There is some evidence that dichloroacetate (which inhibits the specific PDH kinase and thereby activates any residual functioning complex) will also reduce the metabolic disturbance in some patients, but, again, this is rarely accompanied by any objective improvement in neurological performance. A more favorable outcome can be expected in the extremely rare patients with a thiamine responsive form of the disease and, for this reason, a short therapeutic trial of thiamine is worth trying in all cases.","Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency or shortage is a rare disorder caused by genetic changes, and its progression can rarely be stopped by treatment.

The goal of this study was to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of patients with corona virus disease 2019 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and identify factors associated with mortality. Methods: Ninety four consecutive critically ill patients with confirmed corona virus disease 2019 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were included in this retrospective, single-center, observational study. The outcome variable was mortality of patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and factors associated with it during intensive care unit stay. Results: Seventy nine (84%) out of 94 patients with confirmed corona virus disease 2019 who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation didn't survive. Ninety four percent of patients who had Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus did not survive in comparison to 72 percent of patients who didn't have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

17,3730995,"Definitive management of the unconscious choking victim, whether in hospital or in the field, should include removal of the foreign body by instrumentation under direct visualization. However, there is debate as to the best management of the conscious victim with an obstructed upper airway and of the unconscious victim for whom such definitive instrumentation is not available. Which artificial-cough maneuver is the most eficacious in clearing the obstructed airway? Which maneuver should be used first? What are the complications of the various techniques? Is any maneuver dangerous or deleterious? To date there is no consensus on any of these issues. There are significant discrepancies in the literature as to which technique produces the highest intrathoracic pressures and airflow rates. Most of the data seem to support the conclusion that blows to the back generate the highest intrathoracic pressure, whereas chest or abdominal thrust produces the highest airflow rate. Clinically, all the maneuvers are somewhat efficacious in clearing the obstructed airway when used alone; however, each maneuver seems to be substantially more efficacious when used in combination with another maneuver. Also, the results appear to be more successful when pressure is applied as a series of jolts rather than applied steadily.","The best treatment for an unconscious person choking, whether in the hospital or by first responders, should include removal of the object that should not be swallowed with a medical tool while clearly seeing the object. However, experts do not agree about the best way to treat a conscious person with partial or complete blockage of the airway and the unconscious person for whom medical tools are not available. Which way to force air out of a person's lungs works the best to clear the blocked airway? Which way should be used first? What are the complications of the different ways? Is any way dangerous or harmful? To date, there is no agreement on any of these issues. Studies disagree as to which way creates the highest pressure in the chest that forces air out of the lungs and highest airflow rates. Most studies support the idea that blows to the back make the highest pressure in the chest that forces air out of the lungs, while stomach thrusts make the highest airflow rate. All the ways work somewhat to clear the blocked airway on their own; however, each way seems to work much better when combined with another way.

11,28101805,"Objectives: Our aime was to study the short- and long-term effects of ketogenic diet on the disease course and disease-related outcomes in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, the metabolic factors implicated in treatment outcomes, and potential safety and compliance issues. Methods: Pediatric patients diagnosed with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency in Sweden and treated with ketogenic diet were evaluated. Study assessments at specific time points included developmental and neurocognitive testing, patient log books, and investigator and parental questionnaires. A systematic literature review was also performed. Results: Nineteen patients were assessed, the majority having prenatal disease onset. Patients were treated with ketogenic diet for a median of 2.9 years. All patients alive at the time of data registration at a median age of 6 years. The treatment had a positive effect mainly in the areas of epilepsy, ataxia, sleep disturbance, speech/language development, social functioning, and frequency of hospitalizations. It was also safe-except in one patient who discontinued because of acute pancreatitis. The median plasma concentration of ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyric acid) was 3.3 mmol/l. Poor dietary compliance was associated with relapsing ataxia and stagnation of motor and neurocognitive development. Results of neurocognitive testing are reported for 12 of 19 patients. Conclusion: Ketogenic diet was an effective and safe treatment for the majority of patients. Treatment effect was mainly determined by disease phenotype and attainment and maintenance of ketosis.","A ketogenic diet is a low carb, high-fat diet that can help create fuel for the body when glucose levels are low. The aim of this study is to find the short- and long-term effects of a ketogenic diet on disease progression and disease-related outcomes (changes in health) in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, a rare disease that impacts the nervous system. The effects of a ketogenic diet on the body's chemical process to turn food into energy and potential safety issues are also studied. Child patients diagnosed with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency in Sweden and treated with a ketogenic diet are evaluated in this study. The study includes different tests on development and brain function, recording assessments in patient log books, and a series of questions for both researchers and parents to answer. A review of all relevant research on this topic is also performed. Nineteen patients were included in the study. For most of the patients, the disease developed during pregnancy. Patients were treated with ketogenic diet for about 2.9 years, but this time varied. All patients alive at the time of data registration were about 6 years old, but the age did vary. The treatment has a positive effect mainly in the areas of epilepsy (a disorder that causes seizures), ataxia (loss of control of movement), sleep disturbance, speech/language development, social functioning (the ability to engage with others), and the number of hospitalizations. It is also safe-except in one patient who had to stop because of acute pancreatitis, where the pancreas becomes swollen over a short period of time. Not staying on the diet regularly is connected with returning ataxia (loss of control of movement) and slowing or stopping of the strengthening of bones and muscles and brain development. Ketogenic diet is an effective and safe treatment for the majority of patients. How effective treatment is was mostly determined by physical traits or characteristics of patients and by if the body reaches and maintains ketosis, a process where the body burns stored fat for energy instead of glucose.",
16,1139040,"Lymphocyte kinetic studies employing 51-chromium-labeled autologous lymphocytes were performed in nine normal volunteers in order to determine the effects of hydrocortisone administration on the recirculating versus the nonrecirculating intravascular lymphocyte pools. Following infusion of labeled cells, the recirculating portion of the labeled cells rapidly equilibrated with the total intravascular lymphocyte pool and the vastly larger total-body recirculating lymphocyte pool, so that by 1 hr following infusion 21.8% plus or minus 3.2% of the labeled lymphocytes were left in the circulation. Four hundred milligrams of intravenous hydrocortisone administered 24 hr after infusion of labeled cells caused a profound but transient lymphocytopenia which was maximal at 4 hr with return of lymphocyte counts to normal by 24 hr after injection. Concomitant with the lymphocytopenia there was a dramatic increase in lymphocyte specific activity (cpm per 10-6 lymphocytes), while the total lymphocyte-associated radioactivity remaining in the circulation was unchanged, indicating that corticosteroid administration depleted the unlabeled recirculating cells. As the lymphocyte counts returned to normal following hydrocortisone, the specific activity also returned to normal. These studies indicated that hydrocortisone administration caused a transient lymphocytopenia by a preferential depletion of the recirculating portion of the intravascular lymphocyte pool.","Studies on lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system) that are taken from people and returned to the same individuals is performed on nine healthy volunteers to determine the effects of hydrocortisone (a steroid medication used to help calm the immune system) on the lymphocyte pools in blood. The recirculating or re-added part of the new lymphocyte cells returned to volunteers quickly balanced with the total lymphocyte pools and by 1 hour after the cells were put in the body, 21.8% were left in circulation. Hydrocortisone is provided to the volunteers through the vein 24 hours after the infusion of cells. It caused a major but short-term lymphocytopenia (a lower-than-normal number of lymphocytes in the blood) at 4 hours and then lymphocytes returned to normal levels by 24 hours after the injection. Naturally occurring with lymphocytopenia was a big increase in lymphocyte (white blood cell) specific activity, while the total lymphocyte radioactivity (release of energy) in the circulation did not change, suggesting that corticosteroid administration reduced the recirculating cells that were not provided to the volunteers. The lymphocyte counts (white blood cell count) returned to normal after hydrocortisone use. The specific activity also returned to normal. These studies suggest that giving hydrocortisone caused a short-term lymphocytopenia by reducing the recirculating portion of the lymphocyte pool in the blood.",
15,27306796,"Purpose of review: Renal potassium (K) secretion plays a key role in maintaining K homeostasis. The classic mechanism of renal K secretion is focused on the connecting tubule and cortical collecting duct, in which K is uptaken by basolateral Na-K-ATPase and is secreted into the lumen by apical ROMK (Kir1.1) and Ca-activated big conductance K channel. Recently, genetic studies and animal models have indicated that inwardly rectifying K channel 4.1 (Kir4.1 or Kcnj10) in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) may play a role in the regulation of K secretion in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron by targeting the NaCl cotransporter (NCC). This review summarizes recent progresses regarding the role of Kir4.1 in the regulation of NCC and K secretion. Recent findings: Kir4.1 is expressed in the basolateral membrane of the DCT, and plays a predominant role in contributing to the basolateral K conductance and in participating in the generation of negative membrane potential. Kir4.1 is also the substrate of src-family tyrosine kinase and the stimulation of src-family tyrosine kinase activates Kir4.1 activity in the DCT. The genetic deletion or functional inhibition of Kir4.1 depolarizes the membrane of the DCT, inhibits ste20-proline-alanine rich kinase, and suppresses NCC activity. Moreover, the downregulation of Kir4.1 increases epithelial Na channel expression in the collecting duct and urinary K excretion. Finally, mice with low Kir4.1 activity in the DCT are hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia. Summary: Recent progress in exploring the regulation and the function of Kir4.1 in the DCT strongly indicates that Kir4.1plays an important role in initiating the regulation of renal K secretion by targeting NCC and it may serves as a K sensor in the kidney.","Kidney-related potassium (K) secretion helps maintain K balance. Kidney-related K removal commonly focuses on specific parts of sub-kidney units. In these units, K is pulled in by outer-facing protein, which transports K and sodium across a boundary, and is secreted into the inner tube by ROMK (Kir1.1), a K-specific transport protein, and calcium-activated K-specific transport channel. Recently, gene-related studies and animal models have shown that inwardly correcting potassium channel 4.1 (Kir4.1 or Kcnj10) in a specific region of sub-kidney units may monitor potassium secretion in the hormone-sensitive, outward sub-kidney unit by targeting the sodium-chloride cotransporter. This review summarizes recent improvements regarding the role of Kir4.1 channel in regulating the sodium-chloride cotransporter and potassium secretion. Kir4.1 is active in the outer-facing boundary of a specific region of the sub-kidney units and helps transport potassium outward and create a negative boundary charge. Kir4.1 is also the target of a high-energy transporting protein. This transporting protein activates Kir4.1 activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units. The gene-related deletion or silencing of Kir4.1 changes the charge of the boundary of a specific region of sub-kidney units, blocks a high-energy transporting protein, and prevents sodium-chloride channel activity. Also, reducing Kir4.1 activity increases boundary-lining sodium channel activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units and K removal via urine. Finally, mice with low Kir4.1 activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units have low blood magnesium and low blood potassium. Recent progress in exploring the monitoring and use of Kir4.1 in a specific region of sub-kidney units shows that Kir4.1 helps begin the monitoring of kidney-related K removal by targeting sodium-chloride channels. Kir4.1 may also be a K sensor in the kidney.","Renal (kidney-related) secretion or release plays a key role in maintaining potassium homeostasis (processes used by the body to maintain a normal potassium concentration in the fluid outside the cells). Renal release of potassium mainly takes place within the kidneys through as series of tubes and ducts. Potassium is absorbed through the potassium channel that is located at the base or sides of the cell called the basolateral and is released into a tube called the lumen through potassium channels. Recent studies have suggested that potassium channels 4.1 (Kir4.1 or Kcnj10) located within the kidney at the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) (which connects to the duct system in the kidneys and helps with salt and water reabsorption) may play a role in regulating the release of potassium by targeting the NaCl cotransporter (NCC) (the carrier protein that helps reabsorb sodium and chloride ions from tube fluid into the cells). This review summarizes recent progress on the role of the potassium channel Kir4.1 in the control of NCC and potassium secretion (release). Recent findings show that Kir4.1 is activated in the basolateral membrane (the thin layer surrounding a cell located at the base or sides of the cell) of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Kir4.1 plays a major role in helping the basolateral pass potassium through the cell and in helping cell membranes have a negative charge. Kir4.1 also activates proteins that send signals to other cells which in turn activate Kir4.1 activity in the DCT. Kir4.1 depolarizes (changes the internal charge to make the cell less negative) the membrane of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), slows down other proteins that regulate cell activity, and suppresses NaCl cotransporter activity. Additionally, the decrease in function of Kir4.1 increases activity of the epithelial Na channel (the lining of the outer part of the kidney tubule) in the ducts and potassium release through urine. Finally, mice with low Kir4.1 activity in the DCT are hypomagnesemia (have a low level of the magnesium mineral in the blood) and hypokalemia (have low levels of potassium). In summary, recent progress in exploring the control and function of Kir4.1 in the distal convoluted tubule suggests that Kir4.1 has an important role in starting the regulation of releasing potassium in the kidneys by targeting NaCl cotransporter and may be a potassium sensor in the kidney."

50,10530060,"Purpose: To evaluate the practical value of initial C-reactive protein (CRP) in the diagnosis of bacterial infection in children. Methods: The subjects comprised 11 children, six boys and five girls, aged 3 months through to 3 years (median age 16 months), whose initial CRP levels were < 1.0 mg/dL despite bacterial infection. C-reactive protein was quantitated at the first medical examination by nephelometry. Results: The diagnosis was urinary tract infection (n = 4), bacterial meningitis (n = 2), sepsis (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2) and arthritis of the hip joint (n = 1). The CRP levels were significantly elevated during the course of infection, ranging from 7.6 to 28.5 mg/dL. The bacterial etiology was non-specific. Eight patients were examined within 12 h of onset, three exhibited negative CRP values despite the duration of the insult over 12 h. Six patients were tentatively diagnosed as having a bacterial infection, but the other five were not. Each patient was treated, leading to a favorable outcome without any serious complications. Conclusions: Low levels of CRP do not rule out the possibility of bacterial infection in children. The initial value of CRP may be negative, even in patients with severe bacterial infection or even after 12 h from onset. The data suggest that pediatricians should consistently be aware of the possibility of bacterial infection even if the initial CRP test result is negative and that serial CRP measurements appear to be practical.","The aim of this paper was to determine how C-reactive protein volume in patients can help diagnose bacterial infections in children. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). The study evaluated 11 children. The group consisted of six boys and five girls that were between 3 months to 3 years of age. All of the children's' initial CRP levels were < 1.0 mg/dL despite bacterial infection. C-reactive protein was measured at the first medical examination. The eleven children were diagnosed with various illnesses. These include: 4 with urinary tract infection, 2 with bacterial meningitis (inflammation with intense headaches), 2 with sepsis (life-threatening condition when the body's response to infection damages itself), 2 with pneumonia (lung infection) and 1 with arthritis of the hip joint. CRP levels were increased during the course of infection. The cause of the bacterial infections were not specified. Eight patients were examined within 12 h of illness. Three showed negative CRP values despite the duration of the illness over 12 h. Six patients were tentatively diagnosed as having a bacterial infection. The other five were not. Each patient was treated. Treatment led to better health status without any serious complications. Low levels of CRP do not rule out the possibility of bacterial infection in children. The initial value of CRP may be negative, even in patients with severe bacterial infection or even after 12 h from onset. The data suggest that doctors of children should always be aware of the possibility of bacterial infection even if the initial CRP test result is negative (no detection) and that serial (multiple) CRP measurements appear to be practical.",

40,29981730,"Objectives: This study was conducted to determine hemodynamic and clinical tolerance under short-stretch compression therapy in elderly patients suffering from mixed-etiology leg ulcers. Design: Transversal observational study conducted in 25 hospitalized patients with a moderate peripheral arterial occlusive disease defined as an ankle-brachial pressure index>0.5, an ankle pressure of> 70mm Hg and a toe cuff pressure (TP)> 50mm Hg. Material and methods: Short-stretch bandages were applied daily with pressures from 20 to 30mm Hg. Ankle-brachial pressure, great toe laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) on dorsum of the foot were measured at baseline and after its removal at 24hours. Great toe LDF was also measured at 10minutes after bandage application. Compression pressure (CP) was measured with a sub-bandage device at baseline, at 10minutes and before bandage removal at 24hours. Clinical tolerance was evaluated taking into account the patient's pain and skin tolerance. Results: Mean age of patients was 80±15 years. Median duration of ulcers was 18 months. Hypertension was highly prevalent. One third of patients had diabetes. Toe pressure index and TcPO2 values did not significantly change under compression therapy (P=0.51 and P=0.09, respectively) whereas CP decreased significantly during 24hours. The loss of CP was significant 10minutes after bandage application (P<0.001). Nearly all ulcers were painful prior to placement of compression therapy and required level 1 analgesics. One patient required level 2 analgesic for pain relief. No increase in pain and no ischemic skin damage occurred under compression therapy. Conclusions: In elderly patients with mixed leg ulcers and with an absolute TP>50mm Hg, short-stretch compression of up to 30mm Hg does not adversely affect arterial flow and appears clinically well tolerated. Such bandages with appropriate levels of compression may aid ulcer healing by treating the venous part of the disease.","This study aimed to find blood flow and tolerance under less-stretchable compression treatment in elderly patients with mixed-cause leg sores or open wounds (leg ulcers). We studied 25 hospitalized patients with blocked blood vessels in the limbs. Less-stretchable compression bandages were applied daily. Ankle pressure, toe blood flow, and oxygen pressure at the skin on the top of the foot was measured at the start and after bandage removal at 24 hours. Big toe blood flow was measured 10 minutes after applying the bandage. Compression pressure was measured with a special device at the start, at 10 minutes, and before bandage removal at 24 hours. Patient tolerance was measured while considering the patient's pain and skin tolerance. Average age of patients was 80 years. Average duration of sores or open wounds was 18 months. High blood pressure was common. One third of patients had diabetes. Neither pressure nor oxygen to the toes changed with compression therapy, but compression pressure decreased over 24 hours. The compression pressure loss was noticeable 10 minutes after applying the bandage. Nearly all ulcers were painful before compression therapy and needed painkillers. One patient needed a more powerful pain killer. No increase in pain or blood-flow-related skin damage occured with compression. In elderly patients with mixed leg ulcers and sufficient toe pressure, less-stretchable compression does not negatively affect blood flow and appears tolerated. Bandages with appropriate compression may aid ulcer healing by treating the blood flow part of the disease.","The aim of this study was to determine how short-stretch compression therapy affected blood flow and clinical tolerance (how much a patient could take). The study was conducted in elderly patients suffering from leg ulcers (sores) caused by various reasons. This observational study was conducted in 25 hospitalized patients with moderate peripheral aterial occlusive disease, or limited blood flow to lower limbs. Short-stretch bandages were applied daily with pressures ranging from 20 to 30mm Hg. Several health measures were taken before the bandages were applied and after 24 hours. These measures include: ankle-brachial pressure, great toe laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) on top of the foot. LDF measures blood flow. TcPO2 measures oxygen in the skin. Great toe LDF was also measured at 10 minutes after bandage application. Compression pressure (CP) was measured before bandages were placed on, at 10 minutes, and before bandage removal at 24 hours. Clinical tolerance was evaluated taking into account the patient's pain and skin tolerance. The average age of patients was 80 ± 15 years. Median (average) duration of ulcers was 18 months. Hypertension (high blood pressure) was highly common. One third of patients had diabetes. Toe pressure index and TcPO2 values did not significantly change under compression therapy. CP decreased significantly during 24 hours. The loss of CP was significant 10 minutes after bandages were put on. Nearly all ulcers were painful prior to placement of compression therapy and required level 1 (minor) pain medication. One patient required level 2 (more intense) pain medication for pain relief. No increase in pain and no skin damage due to low blood flow occurred under compression therapy. The authors conclude that elderly patients with mixed leg ulcers using short-stretch compression did not have adversely (negatively) affected blood flow to the heart. The treatment was clinically well tolerated. Bandages with appropriate levels of compression may aid ulcer healing by treating the diseased veins."
26,33029620,"Defining the duration of infectivity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has major implications for public health and infection control practice in healthcare facilities. Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required 2 negative RT-PCR tests before discontinuing isolation in patients with Covid-19. Many patients, however, have persistently positive RT-PCR tests for weeks to months following clinical recovery, and multiple studies now indicate that these generally do not reflect replication-competent virus. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be most contagious around the time of symptom onset, and infectivity rapidly decreases thereafter to near-zero after about 10 days in mild-moderately ill patients and 15 days in severely-critically ill and immunocompromised patients. The longest interval associated with replication-competent virus thus far is 20 days from symptom onset. This review summarizes evidence-to-date on the duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and how this has informed evolving public health recommendations on when it is safe to discontinue isolation precautions.","Defining the duration of infectvity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronovirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a viral breathing-related illness, can influence public health and infection control practice for healthcare. Early in the pandemic, most hospitals needed 2 test results detecting no disease before releasing patients with Covid-19, or SARS-CoV-2. Many patients still have test results detecting the disease for weeks to months after recovery. Studies note that these results generally do not reflect contagious viruses. SARS-CoV-2 seems the most contagious around the time of symptom onset. The infectivity or ability to spread the virus quickly decreases to near-zero after about 10 days in mildly ill patients and 15 days in severely ill and immunocompromised patients. The longest interval for contagious viruses so far is 20 days from symptom onset. This review summarizes current evidence on the duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and how this affects new public health recommendation for releasing people in isolation.","Defining the period of time someone can spread Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, to others can positively impact public health and prevent infection spreading within healthcare facilities. COVID-19 is a harmful, breathing-related, viral disease. Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required two negative (or undetected) COVID-19 tests before COVID-19 infected patients could come out of quarantine (isolation). However, several COVID-19 patients continually test positive (with COVID-19 detected) after clinically recovering from the virus. Based on several reports, this is not believed to be the norm for the replication-competent virus, or a virus that is able to reproduce itself in one person and infect other people. The virus appears to be contagious (easily spread) around the time symptoms first appear. The ability of the virus to spread decreases as symptoms progress. The ability of the virus to spread becomes near-zero around 10 days in mild to moderately ill patients. The ability of the virus to spread becomes near-zero around 15 days in severely to critically ill and immunocompromised (those with decreased immune system function) patients. The longest documented duration between symptom onset and viral spread is 20 days. This review summarizes the most recent evidence on the length of time COVID-19 is able to spread from one patient to another. Additionally, this paper states how this knowledge has helped create improved COVID-19 mandates or rules on quarantine lengths."
30,33334398,"Background: Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays are used to test for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives are possible depending on swab type and time since symptom onset. Aim: To determine how the probability of obtaining a false-negative test in infected patients is affected by time since symptom onset and swab type. Methods: We used generalised additive mixed models to analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once. Results: The probability of a positive test decreased with time since symptom onset, with oropharyngeal (OP) samples less likely to yield a positive result than nasopharyngeal (NP) samples. The probability of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was considerably reduced if negative tests were repeated 24 hours later. For a small false-positive test probability (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests. For a higher false-positive test probability, the true number of infected individuals was smaller than the number of positive tests. Conclusion: NP samples are more sensitive than OP samples. The later an infected individual is tested after symptom onset, the less likely they are to test positive. This has implications for identifying infected patients, contact tracing and discharging convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious.","A test called reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is used to test for infection for the coronavirus (which causes COVID-19 - a viral, respiratory illness) by looking for traces of genes from the virus. The chances of getting an incorrect positive (or virus-detected) result is low when using RT-PCR tests, but false negatives (when a person tests negative - not having the virus - but they are actually positive) are possible depending on swab type and time since symptoms started. The aim of this study is to determine how the likelihood of getting a false-negative test in patients with coronavirus is impacted by the time since symptoms started and the type of swab, a small piece of soft material sometimes on the end of a small stick. Publicly available data from patients who received several RT-PCR tests and identified as positive for coronavirus are analyzed. The likelihood of a positive test decreased with the time passed since the start of symptoms. Samples from the middle part of the throat are less likely to give a positive result than swabs from the throat and back of the nose. The chance of incorrectly identifying an uninfected person because of a false-negative is reduced if negative tests are repeated 24 hours later. For a small chance of a false-positive test (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals is larger than the number of positive tests. For a higher chance of a false-positive test, the true number of infected individuals is smaller than the number of positive tests. In conclusion, the samples from the back of the nose called nasopharyngeal are more sensitive than the samples taken in the middle of the throat. The later an infected individual is tested after symptom start, the less likely they are to test positive. This finding may influence decisions on identifying infected patients, contact tracing, or disease tracking, and discharging or releasing recovering patients who are possibly still infectious and can transmit the virus.","Certain molecular tools called RT-PCR assays test for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can cause a threatening breathing-related illness. RT-PCR tests are very specific and detecting a target when there is none (or a false positive) is low. However, not detecting a target when there is one (or a false negative) is possible depending on the swab and time since symptoms. The authors' aim is to determine the likelihood of a false-negative test in infected patients is affected by time since symptoms and swab type. The chance of detecting the target decreased with time since symptoms. Also, oropharyngeal (OP) or mouth samples are less likely to detect the target than nasopharyngeal (NP) or nasal samples. The chance of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was reduced if tests showing no detection were repeated 24 hours later. For a small false-positive test chance (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests or tests detecting the target. For a higher false-positive test likelihood, the true number of infected individuals was smaller than the number of positive tests. NP samples are more sensitive than OP samples. The later an infected individual is tests after symptoms show, the less likely they are to test positive. Time since symptoms has implifications for identifying infected patients, tracing spread, and releasing recovering patients who may still be infectious."
18,17296512,"Aim: To measure ketonemia in a control population of pregnant women and in a population of women with gestational diabetes (GDM). To define a normal ketonemia threshold for the controls and to determine whether or not this value could play a role in the clinical management of women with GDM. Method: Fifty-six women with a normal OGTT and 49 women with GDM were included and monitored from the 25th to the 37th week of pregnancy. Control subjects agreed to perform glycaemia and ketonemia self-monitoring 3 times a day. In addition, women with GDM were asked to measure their postprandial glycaemia. Glycaemia and ketonemia measurements were performed using Optium meters. Subjects kept a 24-hour food record twice a week. Results: The mean ketonemia was lower in the control group than in the GDM group (0.01+/-0.10 vs. 0.04+/-0.009 mmol/l; P<0.001). Ketonemia values measured before the midday meal and prior to the evening meal were lower for control subjects than for GDM patients (P=0.002 and P=0.005). Fasting ketonemia was unrelated to ketonuria in the GDM group, whereas there was a correlation in the control group (P=0.006). At least one chronic increase in ketonemia levels was observed in 47% of the women with GDM, compared with only 12% of controls. The lowest levels of evening glycaemia correlated with the highest levels of ketonemia; women with GDM reported lower food and carbohydrate intakes than controls (P<0.001). Conclusion: This work has enabled the establishment of ketonemia reference standards in non-diabetic pregnant women. If ketonemia does indeed indicate overly restrictive dietary behavior, this parameter could be employed for monitoring adherence to the nutritional recommendations for GDM.","The aim of this study is to measure ketonemia (amount of ketones, a substance that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar, in the body) in a control (comparison) population of pregnant women and in a population of women with gestational diabetes (women diagnosed with diabetes for the first time during pregnancy). This study also aims to define normal ketonemia levels for the comparison group and to determine whether or not this level could play a role in the care of women with gestational diabetes. This study included 56 women with normal oral glucose tolerance test results (a test that measures how the body moves sugar from blood to the tissues). Women in the comparison group agreed to monitor glycaemia (blood sugar levels) and ketonemia themselves 3 times a day. In addition, women with gestational diabetes were asked to measure their blood glucose after a meal. Glycaemia and ketonemia measurements are performed using a small finger stick device. Study participants keep a 24-hour food diary twice a week. The average ketonemia is lower in the comparison group than in the gestational diabetes group. Ketonemia values measured before the midday meal and before the evening meal are lower for the comparison group than for patients with gestational diabetes. Fasting (no food) ketonemia is unrelated to ketonuria (high amounts of ketones in the urine) in the gestational diabetes group, whereas there is a connection in the comparison group. At least one chronic (recurring) increase in ketonemia levels is observed in 47% of the women with gestational diabetes, compared with only 12% in the comparison group. The lowest levels of evening glycaemia correlated with the highest levels of ketonemia; women with gestational diabetes reported lower food and carbohydrate intakes than the comparison group. In conclusion, this work has established ketonemia standards in pregnant women who do not have diabetes. If ketonemia does indicate overly restrictive dietary behavior, this measure could be used for monitoring how well people stick to the nutritional recommendations for gestational diabetes.","The aim is to measure blood ketone bodies (particles made from fat breakdown) in a baseline group of pregnant women and group with gestational diabetes (high blood sugar affecting pregnant women). To define a normal baseline level of blood ketone bodies, made from fat breakdown, and determine if this value could aid management of pregnant women with gestational diabetes or high blood sugar. Fifty-six standard women and 49 with gestational diabetes were measured from the 25th to 37th week of pregnancy. Standard women performed measurements of blood sugar and blood ketone bodies 3 times a day. Also, pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar were asked to measure after-meal blood sugar. Blood and ketone measurements were recorded. Patients kept a 24-hour food record twice a week. Average blood ketone bodies were lower in the standard group than the group with gestational diabetes. Blood ketone bodies measured before the midday and evening meals were lower for standard patients than gestational diabetics. Fasting blood ketone bodies were unrelated to urinary ketone bodies in the pregnant gestational diabetics, unlike the standard group. At least one long-lasting increase in blood ketone bodies occured in 47% of pregnant women with gestational diabetes compared to only 12% of standard patients. The lowest levels of evening blood sugar paralleled the highest levels of blood ketone bodies. Pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar reported lower food and carb intakes than standard women. This work created baselines of blood ketone bodies in non-diabetic pregnant women. If blood ketone bodies do indicate restricting diets, this value may monitor faithfulness to diet recommendations for pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar."
39,34569949,"Background: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. However, clinical feature of PPA based on Aβ positivity remains unclear. Objective: We aimed to assess the prevalence of Aβ positivity in patients with PPA and compare the clinical characteristics of patients with Aβ-positive (A+) and Aβ-negative (A-) PPA. Further, we applied Aβ and tau classification system (AT system) in patients with PPA for whom additional information of in vivo tau biomarker was available. Methods: We recruited 110 patients with PPA (41 semantic [svPPA], 27 non-fluent [nfvPPA], 32 logopenic [lvPPA], and 10 unclassified [ucPPA]) who underwent Aβ-PET imaging at multi centers. The extent of language impairment and cortical atrophy were compared between the A+ and A-PPA subgroups using general linear models. Results: The prevalence of Aβ positivity was highest in patients with lvPPA (81.3%), followed by ucPPA (60.0%), nfvPPA (18.5%), and svPPA (9.8%). The A+ PPA subgroup manifested cortical atrophy mainly in the left superior temporal/inferior parietal regions and had lower repetition scores compared to the A-PPA subgroup. Further, we observed that more than 90%(13/14) of the patients with A+ PPA had tau deposition. Conclusion: Our findings will help clinicians understand the patterns of language impairment and cortical atrophy in patients with PPA based on Aβ deposition. Considering that most of the A+ PPA patents are tau positive, understanding the influence of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers on PPA might provide an opportunity for these patients to participate in clinical trials aimed for treating atypical Alzheimer's disease.","Pimary progressive aphasia (PPA), a language and speech brain disorder, is linked with amyloid-β (Aβ), a brain protein segment associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, symptoms of PPA based on Aβ presence is unclear. We assess the amount of Aβ presence in patients with PPA and compare the symptoms of PPA patients with Aβ presence of Aβ-positive (A+) versus those without Aβ (A-). We also classified Aβ and tau type in PPA patients with this available information. We had 110 PPA patients (41 who can't understand words [svPPA], 27 who can't speak but understand words [nfvPPA], 32 who have trouble finding the right word [lvPPA], and 10 unclassified [ucPPA]) undergo Aβ imaging at multiple centers. The extent of language impairment and brain damage were compared between tehe A+ and A- PPA subgroups. The proportion of Aβ presence was highest in patients with lvPPA (81.3%), then ucPPA (60.0%), nfvPPA (18.5%), and svPPA (9.8%). The A+ PPA subgroup had brain damage mainly on the left side in the middle regions and had worse scores compared to the A- PPA subgroup. Also, over 90% (13/14) patients with A+ PPA had tau, a brain protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. Our findings will help clinicians understand the patterns of language impairment and brain damage in PPA patients based on Aβ presence. Since most A+ PPA patients have tau, understanding the effect of Alzheimer's disease markers on PPA may allow these patients to participate in clinical studies aimed for treating atypical Alzheimer's disease.","Primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a disease that damages nerve tissue, is associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. Amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology is the accumulation of protein plaques in the brain. However, diagnosis of PPA based on Aβ positivity (presence) remains unclear. The goal of this paper was to determine the prevalence (frequency) of Aβ positivity in patients with PPA. The paper also aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of patients with Aβ-positive (A+) and Aβ-negative (A- or no presence of Aβ) PPA. Additionally the authors applied the Aβ and tau classification system (AT system) in patients with PPA. However, this was only done for patients with available information of a tau (a type of protein) biomarker. Biomarkers are measurable, biological substances that can indicate disease in a patient. This study recruited 110 patients with PPA. Of the 110 patients, there were four PPA groups: 41 semantic [svPPA], 27 non-fluent [nfvPPA], 32 logopenic [lvPPA], and 10 unclassified [ucPPA]). Semantic PPA is characterized by loss of language function. Non-fluent PPA is characterized by the gradual loss of speech. Logopenic PPA is characterized by difficulty in naming and sentence repetition. All recruits underwent Aβ-PET (brain scan) imaging at multi centers. The extent of language impairment and cortical atrophy, or brain degeneration, were compared between the A+ and A-PPA subgroups. The prevalence of Aβ positivity was highest in patients with lvPPA, followed by ucPPA, nfvPPA, and svPPA, respectively. The A+ PPA subgroup had cortical atrophy (damage) mainly in the left brain regions and had lower repetition scores when compared to the A- PPA subgroup. The authors observed that >90% of the recruits with A+ PPA had tau or protein deposition. These findings will help clinicians understand the patterns of language impairment and cortical atrophy in patients with PPA based on Aβ deposition. Most of the A+ PPA patents were tau positive. Due to this, understanding the influence of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers on PPA may allow for these patients to participate in clinical trials that treat atypical Alzheimer's disease."
22,32943413,"Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare inherited autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene FLCN, encoding the protein folliculin. Its clinical expression typically includes multiple pulmonary cysts, recurrent spontaneous pneumothoraces, cutaneous fibrofolliculomas and renal tumours of various histological types. BHD has no sex predilection and tends to manifest in the third or fourth decade of life. Multiple bilateral pulmonary cysts are found on chest computed tomography in >80% of patients and more than half experience one or more episodes of pneumothorax. A family history of pneumothorax is an important clue, which suggests the diagnosis of BHD. Unlike other cystic lung diseases such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, BHD does not lead to progressive loss of lung function and chronic respiratory insufficiency. Renal tumours affect about 30% of patients during their lifetime, and can be multiple and recurrent. The diagnosis of BHD is based on a combination of genetic, clinical and/or skin histopathological criteria. Management mainly consists of early pleurodesis in the case of pneumothorax, periodic renal imaging for tumour detection, and diagnostic work-up in search of BHD in relatives of the index patient.","Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare inherited genetic disorder caused by changes in the gene FLCN that makes a protein called folliculin, which helps suppress tumor growth. It is often associated with the development of multiple cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs, sudden collapse of the lung, non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck, and chest (fibrofolliculomas), and kidney tumors. Birt-Hogg-Dubé has no preference between male and female and often appears when people are in their 30s or 40s. Multiple cysts on both lungs are identified using x-rays in more than 80% of patients. More than half experience one or more collapsed lung events which is when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall. A family history of collapsed lung is an important clue and suggests a diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé. Unlike other cystic lung diseases, Birt-Hogg-Dubé does not lead to loss of lung function over time or to ongoing breathing problems. Kidney tumors affect about 30% of patients during their lifetime. There can be multiple number of tumors, and they can be recurring. The diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé is based on a combination of genetic and medical characteristics and/or studying skin and skin cells with a microscope. For a collapsed lung, care mostly involves doing a procedure called pleurodesis early that involves sticking the lung to the chest wall to reduce space in the lungs and chest wall. Scanning the kidneys for tumors using x-rays and finding out if relatives have Birt-Hogg-Dubé are also ways to manage the disorder.","Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare inherited disorder caused by heritable DNA mutations in the tumor stopping gene FLCN, used to create the protein folliculin.

Multiple lung cysts in both lungs are detected in >80% of patients via medical imaging. >50% have one or more episodes of lungs collapsing. A family history of collapsing lungs may help identify BHD. Unlike other lung diseases with lung cysts or swellings, BHD does not lead to loss of lung function overtime and long-lasting breathing deficits. Kidney tumors affect ~30% of patients and can be multiple and reoccuring. Identifying BHD involves genetic, medical, and/or skin-related criteria.

41,32659844,"This consensus-based guideline was developed by all relevant German pediatric medical societies. Ultrasound is the standard imaging modality for pre- and postnatal kidney cysts and should also exclude extrarenal manifestations in the abdomen and internal genital organs. MRI has selected indications. Suspicion of a cystic kidney disease should prompt consultation of a pediatric nephrologist. Prenatal management must be tailored to very different degrees of disease severity. After renal oligohydramnios, we recommend delivery in a perinatal center. Neonates should not be denied renal replacement therapy solely because of their age. Children with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney do not require routine further imaging or nephrectomy, but long-term nephrology follow-up (as do children with uni- or bilateral kidney hypo-/dysplasia with cysts). ARPKD (autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease), nephronophthisis, Bardet-Biedl syndrome and HNF1B mutations cause relevant extrarenal disease and genetic testing is advisable. Children with tuberous sclerosis complex, tumor predisposition (e. g. von Hippel Lindau syndrome) or high risk of acquired kidney cysts should have regular ultrasounds. Even asymptomatic children of parents with ADPKD (autosomal dominant PKD) should be monitored for hypertension and proteinuria. Presymptomatic diagnostic ultrasound or genetic examination for ADPKD in minors should only be done after thorough counselling. Simple cysts are very rare in children and ADPKD in a parent should be excluded. Complex renal cysts require further investigation.","All relevant German child-care medical groups created the agreed-upon guideline. Ultrasound or sound-wave imaging is the standard imaging for pre- and post-birth kidney cysts (fluid-filled swellings) and should exclude non-kidney growths in the abdomen and genitals. Magnetic resonance imaging or imaging with radio waves and magnetic fields has selected uses. Suspicion of a kidney disease with cysts should prompt talking with a child-care kidney specialist. Pre-birth management should be personalized to different degress of disease severity. After renal oligohydramnios (diseases where scarce fluid surrounds the fetus due to kidney damage), we recommend delivery in a preganancy-specialized center. Newborns should not be denied kidney replacement therapy because of age. Children with a single, enlarged, nonfunctional kidney with cysts do not need regular imaging or kidney removal, but long-term kidney-related follow-ups (as do children with single or multiple kidney abnormalities with cysts). ARPKD (autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease), an inherited disorder of many kidney cysts, nephronophthisis (kidney inflammation), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (an inherited disorder that impairs kidneys, eyes, and more), and specific liver-related gene mutations cause disease outside the kidneys. Genetic testing is advisable. Children with an inherited disorder leading to tumors in the skin, brain, kidney and more, or a high risk of tumors (e.g. von Hippel Lindau syndrome) or kidney cysts should have regular ultrasounds. Even children without symptoms and of parents with ADPKD (a similar variant of ARPKD) should be monitored for high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Examining for ADPKD in minors via ultrasound or genes should only be done after in-depth counseling. Simple fluid-filled sacs are very rare in children. ADPDK in parents should be excluded. Compex fluid-filled sacs in the kidney need further investigation.","This guideline was developed by all relevant German pediatric medical societies, which are groups that represent medical professionals that focus on pediatric or child-concerned medicine. An ultrasound is a type of x-ray to see images inside the body and is the common method to view kidney cysts (growths) before and after birth. This method can also exclude cysts in the stomach (abdomen) and inside the genitals. An MRI also takes images of the body and may also be needed in some cases. Suspicion of a cystic kidney disease should lead to consulting a kidney specialist of children. Care provided during pregnancy should align with how serious the disease is and will be slightly different for each patient. Oligohydramnios occur when there is too little amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb) and can sometimes be caused by kidney dysfunction. With this condition, it is recommended that delivery occurs in a birth-delivering center where specialty care is available. Newborns should not be denied therapy that replaces the normal blood-filtering function of the kidneys just because of their age. Children with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney, where one kidney is large with cysts and is not functioning, do not require routine x-rays or surgery to remove one or both kidneys. However they will need long-term follow-up with kidney specialists (as do children with other kidney problems where one or both kidneys are not working well and have cysts). Certain diseases such as ARPKD (autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease - an inherited kidney disease with cysts), nephronophthisis (kidney scarring), and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (a full-body, inherited disease), as well as genetic changes, cause disease outside the kidney, and genetic testing for these conditions is recommended. Children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC - a rare disease that leads to noncancerous tumors forming in the body) or a high risk of developing tumors or kidney cysts should have regular ultrasounds to take images of the inside of the body. Even children of parents with ADPKD (autosomal dominant PKD) who do not have symptoms should be monitored for high blood pressure and increased levels of protein in the urine. Testing for ADPKD in minors using an ultrasound or genetic testing should only be done after a great deal of counseling. Simple cysts are very rare in children, and ADPKD in a parent should be excluded. Complex kidney cysts require more investigation."
38,31976835,"Background: The biodegradable and biocompatible nature of pectin-based films is of particular interest in wound dressing applications, due to its non-toxicity, pH-sensitivity and gelling activity. An approach to improve the mechanical properties, the release profile of bioactive compounds as well as the performance in wet environments of pectin-based films is mixing with other biopolymers. Objective: To prepare hydrocolloid films based on crosslinked pectin / starch blend loaded with bioactive extracts from leaves of G. tinctoria and U. molinae with controlled release of bioactive compounds and healing property. Methods: The hydrocolloid films were characterized by FTIR, SEM, and TGA-FTIR techniques and their tensile properties, water uptake, and polyphenolic release profile in aqueous media were evaluated. The dermal anti inflammatory activity of the hydrocolloid films was assessed by the mouse ear inflammation test. The wound healing property of the loaded hydrocolloid films was explored in a rat model and in a clinical trial (sacrum pressure ulcer). Results: The films showed an adequate water-uptake capacity between 100-160%. The release of active compounds from the hydrocolloid films followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation. The mechanical properties of hydrocolloid films were not affected by the plant extracts within the concentration range used. The incorporation of the bioactive extracts in the polysaccharide films inhibited the topical edematous response by about 50%. The topical application of the loaded hydrocolloid film on the pressure ulcer is completely closed after 17 days without showing any adverse reaction. Conclusion: A novel hydrocolloid matrix was produced from crosslinked starch-pectin, which exhibited suitable chemical-physical properties to be used as a carrier of plant extracts with wound healing properties.","The recycability of pectin-based films (thin strips of plant-based fiber) is of interest in wound bandaging, due to its non-toxicity, acid-sensitivity, and gel-like nature. One idea to improve the function, bioactive composition, and performance when wet of pectin-based films is mixing it with other biological molecules. Our objective is to create waterproof films based on a pectin/starch blend with specific plant extracts that have controlled release of bioactive and healing substances. The molecular composition of the waterproof films were measured with specific tools. We also measured the tension strength, water uptake, and bioactive molecules released in water. The skin-related anti-inflammatory activity of the waterproof films was measured by testing its anti-inflammatory eactivity on an inflammed mouse ear. We tested the healing effects of the active waterproof films with rats and human bedsores. The films showed an acceptable water-uptake capacity between 100-160%. The release of biological compounds from the waterproof films followed a standard drug-release trend. The function of the waterproof films was not affected by the plant extracts within the amounts used. Adding plant extracts into the films blocked the skin swelling by around 50%. The application of the active waterproof film on the surface of the bedsore is closed after 17 days without any side effects. A new waterproof film was created from a starch-pectin blend, with suitable chemical-physical properties to carry plant extracts with wound healing effects.","Pectin-based films are wrapping that is made from pectin, a substance extracted from ripe fruits. Pectin-based films are biodegradable and biocompatible. Additionally, the films are non-toxic, are pH (acid-base) sensitive, and have gelling activity. These qualities make the films of interest in wound dressing. In order to improve how the films responsd to stress and strain, specifically how the material holds up when wet, other biopolymers could be mixed with the pectin-based films. Biopolymers are substances that are found within living organisms, just like pectin is found in fruit. The aim of this study was the prepare hydrocolloid (gel-forming) films using a pectin and starch blend with extracts from two different leaves. The film was made to have a controlled release of bioactive compounds and healing properties. Bioactive compounds are components of food that influence biological or cellular activity within humans or animals that eat them. The hydrocolloid films were tested for their tensile strength (resistance to tension breakage), water uptake, and polyphenolic release profile in wet environments. Polyphenols are compounds with various biological properties, including anti-inflammatory (anti-swelling and -redness from an infection) and antioxidant. The skin anti-inflammatory activity of the hydrocolloid films was assessed (measured) by a test evaluating inflammation on a mouse ear. The wound healing property of the hydrocolloid films was explored in a rat model. The wound healing property was also explored in a human clinical trial looking at lower back pressure ulcers (skin sores). The films showed an adequate water-uptake capacity between 100-160%. The release of active compounds from the hydrocolloid films followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation, which implies that release of healing properties was controlled over time. The mechanical properties of the hydrocolloid films, or how they respond to stress, were not affected by the plant extracts. Addition of the same bioactive extracts in a carbohydrate-based film significantly decreased the topical edematous response or the accumulation of watery fluid. Applying the loaded hydrocolloid film on the pressure ulcer completely closed the wound after 17 days without any negative side effects. The study concluded that a novel (new) hydrocolloid mixture was produced from starch and pectin. This mixture showed suitable chemical-physical properties to act as a carrier of plant extracts with wound healing properties."

42,34667098,"Histones constitute the chief protein component of DNA. They help to maintain chromatin structure and regulate gene expression. The long double-stranded DNA molecule winds around histone octamers to form nucleosomes which serve the purpose of compacting DNA within the confines of the nuclear membrane. There are five major types of histones, namely H1/H5, H2, H3 and H4. H3.3 is a subtype of H3 histone and can be encoded either by the H3F3A or H3F3B genes independently. Amino acids such as lysine and arginine found in the histone tails are sites of post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as methylation and acetylation. These PTMs in histones are involved in the regulation of gene expression by chromatin remodelling and by controlling DNA methylation patterns. Mutations in histone genes can affect sites of PTMs causing changes in local and global DNA methylation status. These effects are directly linked to neoplastic transformation by altered gene expression. Recurrent H3.3 histone mutations are increasingly identified in several malignancies and developmental disorders. The following review attempts to shed light on the diseases associated with H3.3 histone mutations.","Histones make up the chief protein part of DNA. They help to maintain the structure of chromatin, which helps package the DNA in a compact form so it fits in the cell nucleus (chamber holding the DNA in a cell), and regulate how the instructions from genes are used. The long double-stranded DNA molecule winds around a group of histone proteins to form a structure called nucleosomes. Nucleosomes compact DNA within the cell wall. There are five major types of histones, namely H1/H5, H2, H3 and H4. H3.3 is a subtype of H3 histone and can be encoded (given instructions on how to structure it) either by the H3F3A or H3F3B genes independently. Molecules that combine to build proteins are called amino acids. Some are found in the histone tails and are sites of changes to the properties and make-up of proteins, a process called post-translational modifications (PTMs). These changes in histones are involved in regulating how genetic information is used from genes. Mutations (changes) in histone genes can affect sites of PTMs, causing changes in how genes can be silenced or slowed. These effects are directly linked to changes in cells by altered genes.

50,1887812,"Sarcoidosis is characterized by granuloma formation, the macrophage being the most important building block. The activated macrophage in sarcoidosis produces interleukin-1 (II-1). It is well known that interleukin-1, among other functions, stimulates the hepatic production of C-reactive protein. We therefore prospectively measured the serum C-reactive protein in 17 patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis, 10 patients with other chronic interstitial lung diseases of unknown etiology, 11 patients with active lung tuberculosis, and 10 healthy volunteers. Serum C-reactive protein was assayed by enzymoimmunodiffusion test. The serum C-reactive protein was negative in 13 patients suffering from active sarcoidosis and positive in four. Patients with other interstitial lung diseases had negative results in 7 and positive in 3 cases. The analyses of C-reactive protein in patients with sputum positive lung tuberculosis were positive in 10 cases. All the healthy controls had negative C-reactive protein measurements. The difference between the groups was statistically significant when sarcoidosis and tuberculosis serum C-reactive protein measurements were compared (p less than 0.01), as well as the difference between the group of other interstitial lung diseases and tuberculosis (p less than 0.01). In this respect, the measurements of serum C-reactive protein are valuable in the differentiation of sarcoidosis and other chronic interstitial lung diseases of unknown etiology from tuberculosis and other diseases which are known to induce an acute phase response.","Sarcoidosis is a disease that is characterized by granuloma formation or the tiny growth collections of inflammation (infection-fighting) cells. One of these cell types is the immune cell, macrophage. Macrophages are one of the most important building blocks of this disease. Macrophage in sarcoidosis produces interleukin-1 (II-1), a protein that helps fight infections. Interleukin-1 has many functions, including the stimulation of the hepatic (liver) production of C-reactive protein. C-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). Serum (blood) C-reactive protein was measured in 48 patients. Seventeen of the patients had active sarcoidosis in the lung. Ten patients had other lung diseases of unknown origin. Eleven patients had active lung tuberculosis (a serious lung infection). Ten patients were healthy volunteers. Serum C-reactive protein was measured. The serum C-reactive protein was negative (no detection) in 13 patients suffering from active sarcoidosis and positive in four. Patients with other lung diseases had negative results in 7 cases and positive (was detected) in 3 cases. The analyses of C-reactive protein in patients with lung tuberculosis were positive in 10 cases. All the healthy controls had negative C-reactive protein measurements. The difference between the groups was statistically significant when sarcoidosis and tuberculosis serum C-reactive protein measurements were compared.

51,62945,"Pancreatic islet-cell antibodies (I.C.Ab) were detected in 31 patients with organ-specific autoimmune disorders, 4 first-degree relatives of I.C.Ab-positive diabetics, and 1 apparently normal subject, none of whom had clinical evidence of diabetes. 10 of these 36 subjects were found to have diabetic glucose-tolerance tests (G.T.T.S), 4 had lag storage, and 22 had normal G.T.T.S.2 had latent diabetes, as evidenced by diabetic G.T.T.S during pregnancy and thyrotoxicosis; another 2 subsequently developed insulin-dependent diabetes (I.D.D.) Serum from 26 subjects had been stored for 1-11 yr before the G.T.T.S were done. The titres in some were shown to rise and fall over the years, while in others they remained remarkably constant. There was no correlation between the titre, change in titre or the duration of I.C.Ab or the presence of HLA-B8, BW15, or CW3 and the result of the G.T.T. In addition to acting as a marker for asymptomatic and latent diabetes and prediabetes, it seems that the presence of I.C.Ab in the serum may define a new group of potential diabetics with normal G.T.T.S. Many such subjects have one or more organ-specific autoimmune disorders (irrespective of diabetic family history), but some are first-degree relatives of I.C.Ab-positive subjects (mainly I.D.D.). About 0-5% of the general population also have I.C.Ab in their serum.","We found pancreatic islet-cell antibodies (I.C.Ab; proteins made against insulin-producing cells in the pancreas) in 31 patients with disorders where the body's defense system attacks certain organs; 4 parents, siblings, or children of people with I.C.Ab-positive diabetes, and 1 apparently normal person, none of whom had symptoms of diabetes. Of these 36 people, glucose (sugar molecule)-tolerance tests (G.T.T.S) showed 10 had diabetes, 4 had lag storage (normal glucose levels spike and return to normal), and 22 had normal results. Two people had latent diabetes (slow progressing with features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes) while pregnant and thyrotoxicosis (too much metabolism-regulating thyroid hormone in the body) and another 2 later developed type 1 diabetes.

8,20739894,"Background and objective: despite the introduction of newer antiemetics in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), perphenazine is recommended in current guidelines, as the concept of multimodal management of PONV in high-risk patients requires more than two drugs to be combined. The aim of this quantitative systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of perphenazine in the prophylaxis of PONV in adults and children. Results: eleven trials published between 1965 and 1999 including a total of 2081 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were further analysed. In children, perphenazine 0.07 mg kg was effective in preventing vomiting (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.18-0.54), whereas in adults, a dose of about 5 mg was effective for the prevention of PONV (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37-0.67). When compared with established newer drugs, for example, ondansetron, dexamethasone or droperidol, no significant differences were observed in the pooled analysis with limited data. Reporting of adverse events was poor. Transient sedation was reported in three eligible trials (RR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.40-2.05). Conclusion: there is evidence that perphenazine is effective in the prevention of PONV in children and adults without serious adverse effects compared with placebo.","Even though there are newer drugs to prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery, current guidelines recommend the drug perphenazine. A multi-process way to prevent nausea and vomiting in high-risk patients requires using more than two drugs. We aimed to rate the success and safety of perphenazine in prevention of nausea and vomiting in adults and children. We looked at eleven studies published between 1965 and 1999 with a total of 2081 people. Perphenazine 0.07 mg kg and 5 mg prevented nausea and vomiting in children and adults, respectively. We saw no big differences compared to newer drugs like ondansetron, dexamethasone or droperidol in studies with limited results. Side effects were not well reported. Short-term sedation occurred in three studies. Studies show that perphenazine prevents nausea and vomiting in children and adults without serious side effects compared to sham treatment.","Despite newer anti-nausea drugs, perphenazine (an anti-psychotic) is still used in multimodal treatment of nausea and vomiting post-operation in high-risk patients that need two or more drugs. This work measures the success and safety of perphenazine in preventing post-operation nausea and vomiting. Eleven trials published between 1965 and 1999 included 2081 total participats for analysis. In children, 0.07 mg kg of perphenzaine prevented vomiting while 5 mg prevented post-operation nausea and vomiting in adults. Compared to newer anti-nausea and -vomiting drugs, no differences were observed. Reporting of harmful events was poor. Three trials reported temporary sedation or a calming effect. Perphenazine may be effective in preventing post-operation nausea and vomiting in children and adults without serious harmful effects."
12,26277597,"Lower respiratory tract infections by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the foremost cause of infant hospitalization and are implicated in lasting pulmonary impairment and the development of asthma. Neutrophils infiltrate the airways of pediatric patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis in vast numbers: approximately 80% of infiltrated cells are neutrophils. However, why neutrophils are recruited to the site of viral respiratory tract infection is not clear. In this review we discuss the beneficial and pathologic contributions of neutrophils to the immune response against RSV infection. Neutrophils can limit viral replication and spread, as well as stimulate an effective antiviral adaptive immune response. However, low specificity of neutrophil antimicrobial armaments allows for collateral tissue damage. Neutrophil-induced injury to the airways during the delicate period of infant lung development has lasting adverse consequences for pulmonary architecture and might promote the onset of asthma in susceptible subjects. We suggest that pharmacologic modulation of neutrophils should be explored as a viable future therapy for severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis and thereby prevent the inception of subsequent asthma. The antiviral functions of neutrophils suggest that targeting of neutrophils in patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis is best performed under the umbrella of antiviral treatment.","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a contagious virus that infects the lungs and airway tubes and can lead to lower respiratory tract infections (infection in the airways). These infections are a common reason for infant hospital stays, long-term lung problems, and the development of asthma, a long-term condition that affects the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs and makes it hard to breathe. Many neutrophils (white blood cells that fight infection) enter the airways of children with bronchiolitis (a common lung infection in children and infants) caused by RSV. However, why neutrophils are sent to the site of lung infection is not clear. This review discusses how neutrophils help the immune system respond to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Neutrophils can limit how the virus spreads and can activate the immune system to fight the virus. Sometimes neutrophils that are fighting infection can lead to tissue damage. Neutrophils that cause injury to airways when an infant's lungs are being developed have a long-term impact on lung function and may lead to asthma. Medications that can change neutrophils may be explored as a possible therapy for bronchiolitis caused by RSV and prevent the development of asthma. For patients with bronchiolitis caused by RSV, it is best to use a general antiviral medication when also using neutrophils to help fight infection.",
16,11753760,"The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of corticosteroids on Th1 and Th2 serum cytokine balance in patients with GO: IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-4 and IL-10. Further, we tested the hypothesis of an up-regulation of Th2 immune response during successful treatment with corticosteroids to explain their beneficial effect in Graves' ophthalmopathy. Serum cytokines were detected in three groups of subjects: 20 patients with Graves' disease without ophthalmopathy (Gd), 16 patients with clinical symptoms of ophthalmopathy (GO) (CAS over 3 points, last consultation record for GO less than a year old) and 16 healthy volunteers. Corticosteroid therapy consisted of intravenous infusions of methylprednisolone (MP) (2 series, 3 g each time) and subsequent treatment with oral prednisone (60 mg per day) in a tapering schedule. The serum samples were collected 24 hours before MP, 24 hours after MP, 14 days of treatment with prednisone and at the end of corticosteroid therapy. The levels of IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-4 and IL-10 in the serum were determined using ELISA. Statistical significance was estimated by the Mann-Whitney U-test. Our findings show a deviation to systemic Th2 profile cytokines in Graves' disease. In patients with GO, we found a significantly increased serum IL-10 concentration. In corticosteroid-responsive patients, the balance of serum cytokines IL-4/IFNgamma, IL-4/TNFalpha, IL-10/IFNgamma and IL-10/TN Falpha increased and remained upregulated until the end of the study. In non-responders, the balance of serum cytokines studied increased after methylprednisolone but declined markedly during continuation of the therapy with prednisone. In summary, our results show that efficient corticosteroid therapy may be related to its influence on Th2/Th1 profile cytokine balance. The upregulation of serum IL-4 and IL-10 during successful treatment with corticosteroids indicate the possibility of using these cytokines as predictors of the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in Graves' ophthalmopathy.","The aim of this study is to estimate the effect of corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory drugs that help relieve pain and swelling, also known as steroids) on blood level balance of Th1-related (cells that activate cellular immune responses) and Th2-related (cells that activate hormonal immune responses) cytokines (chemical messengers that coordinate the immune response) in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (swelling of the tissue in the area around the eyes). Further, researchers tested the theory of an up-regulation of the Th2 immune response (where Th2 cells increase their responses to a signal from outside the cell to carry out specific functions) during successful treatment with corticosteroids. Chemical messengers in the blood called cytokines are detected in 3 groups of study participants: 20 patients with Graves' disease without ophthalmology, 16 patients with clinical symptoms of Graves' ophthalmology, and 16 healthy volunteers. Corticosteroid therapy consisted of intravenous (IV) infusions (medication delivered through the vein) of methylprednisolone (a steroid drug) and followed by treatment with oral or by-mouth prednisone (a steroid drug) in a gradually decreasing schedule. Blood samples are collected before and after methylprednisolone, 14 days of treatment with prednisone (a type of steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling), and at the end of the corticosteroid therapy.  The findings show a shift in the response of Th2 cytokines in Graves' disease. In patients with Graves' ophthalmology, there is a significantly increased blood concentration of Interleukin 10 or IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine which helps minimize damage to the body caused by the immune's response. In patients that received corticosteroids and had a response from the drug, the balance of certain blood cytokines that were measured had increased and remained increased until the end of the study. In those patients who did not respond to the corticosteroids, the balance of the specific blood cytokines studied had increased after receiving methylprednisolone but declined a great deal as the therapy continued with prednisone. In summary, results show that effective corticosteroid therapy may be related to its influence on Th2/Th1 cytokine profile balance. The upregulation or increase of blood IL-4 and IL-10 during successful treatment with corticosteroids suggests the possibility of using these cytokines to help predict the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in Graves' ophthalmopathy.",
35,24809808,"We evaluated the prevalence and geographic variation of short-interval (repeated in under 2 years) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry tests (DXAs) among Medicare beneficiaries. Short-interval DXA use varied across regions (coefficient of variation = 0.64), and unlike other DXAs, rates decreased with payment cuts. Introduction: The American College of Rheumatology, through the Choosing Wisely initiative, identified measuring bone density more often than every 2 years as care ""physicians and patients should question."" We measured the prevalence and described the geographic variation of short-interval (repeated in under 2 years) DXAs among Medicare beneficiaries and estimated the cost of this testing and its responsiveness to payment change. Methods: Using 100 % Medicare claims data, 2006-2011, we identified DXAs and short-interval DXAs for female Medicare beneficiaries over age 66. We determined the population rate of DXAs and short-interval DXAs, as well as Medicare spending on short-interval DXAs, nationally and by hospital referral region (HRR). Results: DXA use was stable 2008-2011 (12.4 to 11.5 DXAs per 100 women). DXA use varied across HRRs: in 2011, overall DXA use ranged from 6.3 to 23.0 per 100 women (coefficient of variation = 0.18), and short-interval DXAs ranged from 0.3 to 8.0 per 100 women (coefficient of variation = 0.64). Short-interval DXA use fluctuated substantially with payment changes; other DXAs did not. Short-interval DXAs, which represented 10.1 % of all DXAs, cost Medicare approximately US$16 million in 2011. Conclusions: One out of ten DXAs was administered in a time frame shorter than recommended and at a substantial cost to Medicare. DXA use varied across regions. Short-interval DXA use was responsive to reimbursement changes, suggesting carefully designed policy and payment reform may reduce this care identified by rheumatologists as low value.","We rated the number and variation (or differences) across the country of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry tests (DXAs - useful tests for measuring bone density) repeated in under 2 years (short-interval) in people on Medicare during a specific period. Use of short-interval DXAs varied across the country and unlike other DXAs, use went down with Medicare payment cuts. A campaign to avoid unnecessary medical tests, treatments and procedures found measuring bone density more often than every 2 years as care ""physicians and patients should question."" We rated the number and variation across the country of short-interval DXAs in people on Medicare during a specific period and estimated the testing cost and how much is changed based on payment. We used only information from Medicare claims in 2006-2011 to find DXAs and short-term DXAs for females over age 66 on Medicare. We found out how many DXAs and short-term DXAs were done, and how many Medicare dollars were spent on short-interval DXAs, across the country and by healthcare markets. From 2008-2011, DXA use was steady (12.4 to 11.5 DXAs per 100 women). DXA use varied across healthcare markets. Short-interval DXA use changed a lot based on payment; other DXAs did not. In 2011, Medicare spent about $16 million USD on short-interval DXAs, which made up 10.1% of all DXAs. We conclude that one out of 10 DXAs was done sooner than recommended, costing Medicare considerably. DXA use varied across the country. Short-interval DXA use changed based on payment, suggesting policy and payment changes may decrease this low-value care.",
37,32377769,"Pregabalin abuse has become an emerging concern; thus, the current study has been designed to study the neurotoxic hazards of prolonged high-dose of pregabalin (akin to that abused by addicts) and to evaluate the effect of alpha tocopherol as a possible ameliorating agent. The current study evaluated the brain neurotransmitters; dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine. The study also assessed the expression of the apoptosis-related markers Bax, Bcl2, and caspase 3. Western-blotted analysis of the three major mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), the p38 MAPK, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), has also been performed. The study also evaluated oxidative stress via assessment of the cortical tissue levels of reduced glutathione and malondialdehyde and the activity of superoxide dismutase. Histopathological examination and histomorphometric evaluation of the darkly degenerated cortical neurons have also been performed. Pregabalin in high doses (150 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day) disrupted the ERK/JNK/p38-MAPK signaling, reversed the bax/bcl2 ratio, and induced oxidative stress. It also diminished the release of dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine and increased the count of degenerated neurons. Alpha tocopherol treatment significantly attenuated the deleterious effects induced by pregabalin. The role of alpha tocopherol in ameliorating the oxidative stress injury, and apoptosis induced by pregabalin, along with its role in normalizing neurotransmitters, modulating the ERK/JNK/p38-MAPK signaling pathways and improving the histopathological cortical changes, offers alpha tocopherol as a promising adjunctive therapy in patients undergoing prolonged pregabalin therapy as those suffering from prolonged seizures and neuropathies.","Pregabalin, a drug often used to treat nerve damage, abuse has become an emerging concern. The current study aimed to investigate nervous system (brain and spinal cord) damage caused by prolonged high-dose of pregabalin. This dose is similar to that used by addicts. Additionally, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of alpha tocopherol, a type of Vitamin E, as a possible agent to help side effects. The study evaluated the brain neurotransmitters; dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers in the body. The study also assessed (measured) the expression of the cell death-related markers Bax, Bcl2, and caspase 3. Additional tests evaluating three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) was completed. MAPKs are involved in biological pathways that direct cell response to mitogens, or things that induce cell division. The study also evaluated oxidative stress which is an imbalance between production and accumulation of harmful oxygen reactive species. Evaluations of the degenerated cortical neurons, nerve cells within the brain, were also preformed. Pregabalin in high doses (150 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day) disrupted the signaling for cellular processes, reversed ratios of proteins needed for cell cycles, and induced oxidative stress. It also diminished the release of neurotransmitters and increased the count of degenerated neurons. Alpha tocopherol treatment significantly reduced the harmful effects induced by pregabalin. Alpha tocopherol plays a role in reducing negative side effects induced by pregabalin. It also normalizes neurotransmitter levels, positively effects signaling pathways for cell function, and improves cortical (brain) structure changes. These reasons make alpha tocopherol a promising therapeutic option in patients undergoing prolonged pregabalin therapy.",

Objectives: To assess the effects of pre-hospital interventions (alone or in combination) for treating acute oral poisoning, available to and feasible for laypeople before the arrival of professional help. Authors' conclusions: The studies included in this review provided mostly low- or very low-certainty evidence about the use of first aid interventions for acute oral poisoning. A key limitation was the fact that only one included study actually took place in a pre-hospital setting, which undermines our confidence in the applicability of these results to this setting.

The objective is to measure the effects of pre-hospital treatments (alone or in combination) for immediate oral poisoning, available to anyone before professional help arrives. The studies in this review provided mostly unreliable evidence about using first aid treatments for immediate oral poisoning.

36,34499550,"The mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL) has become a versatile tool to remove kidney stones >2 cm, lower pole stones >1 cm, renal stones previously unresponsive to shockwave therapy or inaccessible by ureteroscopy (within a caliceal diverticulum), stones within complex urinary tracts (urinary diversions, transplanted kidney, and horseshoe kidneys), and large impacted proximal ureteral stones. After positioning in either the supine or prone position, a cystoscopy is performed to place an open-ended catheter, occlusion balloon, or Accordian device into the collecting system. A foley catheter is placed in the bladder. An ultrasound with a curvilinear probe is used to survey the kidney and guide access into the collecting system with an 18 g percutaneous needle. Once access is obtained, a small 0.5 cm skin incision is made and the percutaneous tract is dilated over a wire. A 16.5F metallic or self-dilating suctioning access sheath is positioned with fluoroscopic guidance. A 12F rigid mini-PCNL nephroscope is used to evaluate the collecting system. Once a calculus is observed, options for stone fragmentation include a lithotripter with ultrasonic and ballistic energy, or laser lithotripsy using holmium or thulium laser fibers. Flexible ureteroscopy can be considered to ensure clearance of the collecting system. A 6F ureteral stent can be placed in either a retrograde or antegrade approach for drainage. The tract is sealed using Surgiflo hemostatic matrix with thrombin. Guidelines for postoperative care and troubleshooting techniques for mini-PCNL are reviewed along with the surgical steps in the accompanying video (Supplementary Video S1). There are few randomized trials comparing mini-PCNL with standard PCNL and ureteroscopy. There is some evidence to suggest a difference in transfusion rates comparing mini- and standard PCNL, as well as differences in stone-free rates when comparing mini-PCNL with ureteroscopy for the treatment of lower pole stones.","Mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL) is a tool to remove a variety of stones including: large kidney stones > 2 cm, lower kidney stones > 1 cm, kidney stones unaffected by shockwaves or surgical extraction, stones in complex tubes transporting urine, and large, unchanged stones causing inflammation in tubes carrying urine. After lying down, an open-ended tube to collect urine, device to collect stone fragments, or device to block escape of stone framgents is inserted into the urine tube. A thin tube is placed in the bladder to drain pee. Guided sound waves are used to explore the kidney and reach the urine-collecting system with an 18 g surgical needle. Once access is obtained, a small 0.5 cm skin cut is made and the opening is enlarged with wires. A metallic or self-enlarging vacuum is placed with x-ray guidance. A rigid, small tube with a lens is used to explore the urine-collecting system. Once a stone is observed, options for breaking it up include using a device with sound waves and bullet energy, or special laser. Using a tube with a scope can ensure full removal from the urine-collecting system. A tube to keep the urine flowing can be placed against or with urine flow for drainage. The opening is sealed with a special surgical sealant. The accompanying video (Supplementary Video S1) shows guidelines for care after surgery and troubleshooting techniques for mini-PCNL along with the actual surgery. There are a few trials comparing mini-PCNL with the standard treatment option. There may be a difference in urine transfer rates between mini- and standard PCNL. There may also be differences in stone-free rates between mini-PCNL and the standard treatment of lower kidney stones.","Mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL) is when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a small camera to help remove kidney stones. The mini-PNCL has become a useful tool to remove kidney stones of different sizes, stones that did not respond to other treatments, and it can also remove stones in the urinary tract, the body's drainage system to remove urine. When lying either flat on the back (supine position) or on the stomach and face down (prone position), a hollow tube with a lens is inserted into the urethra tube that goes to bladder to allow another device such as a catheter (a clean tube that goes into the bladder) into the collecting system which is the series of tubes and ducts of the kidney. A foley catheter (soft tube that is inserted into your bladder to drain urine) is placed in the bladder. An ultrasound (a technology that uses sound waves to take images of the inside the body) is used to look at the kidney and guide access to the collecting system with a needle. Once access is obtained, a small incision (cut) on the skin is made, and the tract through the skin is increased in size. A device called a suctioning access sheath is positioned to act like a vacuum and absorb fragments. A mini-PCNL nephroscope (telescope with camera) is used to evaluate the collecting system. Once the kidney stone is seen, options to break it up include a machine that pulverizes stones with shock waves or ballistic energy, or a laser is used to break up kidney stones. A flexible tube can be used to ensure removal from the collecting system. A thin, flexible tube that holds ureters (tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder) open called a stent can be used for drainage. The tract is sealed.

Histones can act as antimicrobial peptides and directly kill bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses, in vitro and in a variety of animal hosts. In addition, histones can trigger inflammatory responses in some cases acting through Toll-like receptors or inflammasome pathways.

36,34518466,"Introduction: Although spinal anesthesia (SA) may reduce postoperative morbidity, most urologists perform flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS) under general anesthesia (GA). The objective of our study is to provide technical details, results, complications, and patients' satisfaction with fURS performed under exclusive SA. Methods: We analyzed all consecutive fURS performed under SA to treat renal stones from March 2011 to February 2017. Details of technique, operative time, outcomes, need for further treatments, complications, and patients' satisfaction were evaluated. Results: Two hundred thirty-four fURS under SA were considered. SA was performed through L2-L3 vertebral interspace in 64.1%. Patients were discharged the same day of surgery. Mean stone burden was 13.5 ± 6.6 mm and mean operative time 76.9 ± 34.6 min. Single-procedure SFR was 69.7%. Further treatments were performed in 22.8%. 96.6% had no anesthesia-related complications. No Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ IIIb complications were noticed. 99.6% of patients were satisfied with SA. No cases of conversion from SA to GA occurred. Conclusion: fURS can be performed safely and efficiently under SA, taking into account a few details of the technique. Patients' satisfaction with SA is very high, and complications are rare. Although SA is usually adopted in unfit patients for GA, it may be considered as a viable alternative in fit patients.","Spinal anesthesia (SA) are medicines that numbs the back of patients to reduce pain after surgery. However, most urologists (doctors who specialize in conditions of the urinary or urine-related tract) use general anesthesia that puts a patient into a heavy sleep when doing a flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS), a procedure that uses a telescope, and occasionally a laser, to break stones in the kidney into pieces. The objective of this study is to provide technical details, results, complications, and patients' satisfaction with fURS when performed under only spinal anesthesia to numb only parts of the body. Researchers analyzed all flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS) done under spinal anesthesia to treat kidney stones from March 2011 to February 2017. Details of the technique, how long the procedure takes, results, need for additional treatments, complications, and patients' satisfaction are evaluated. There are 234 fURS procedures done under spinal anesthesia considered. SA was done in a certain area of the lower spine in 64.1%. Patients are sent home the same day of surgery. The average stone burden was 13.5 millimeters (± 6.6 millimeters), and the average procedure time is 76.9 minutes ( ± 34.6 minutes). The percentage of patients who are stone free after one procedure is 69.7%. Additional treatments are done in 22.8% of patients. Overall, 96.6% had no anesthesia-related complications. No complications that required general anesthesia or other major complications are noticed. 99.6% of patients are satisfied with spinal anesthesia.

40,20483864,"Background: A too high resting pressure of compression devices is poorly tolerated and may cause skin defects, especially in patients with concomitant arterial occlusive disease. Aim: To investigate whether low compression pressure will improve venous pumping function in patients with venous incompetence. Material and methods: Venous pumping function was assessed in 20 patients with severe reflux in the great saphenous vein by measuring ejection fraction (EF) using strain-gauge plethysmography. Measurements were repeated after application of knee-high medical compression stockings and of inelastic bandages applied with a pressure of 20, 40 and 60 mmHg in the supine position. Results: EF was significantly reduced compared with healthy controls. Compression stockings exerting a median pressure of 27 mmHg (interquartile range [IQR] 25-29) in the supine and 30.5 mmHg (IQR 28.25-34.25) in the standing position produced a moderate, non-significant improvement of EF of 17%. Inelastic bandages with a resting pressure of 20.5 mmHg (IQR 20-22) in the supine position resulting in a standing pressure of 36 mmHg (IQR 33-40.75) led to a significant increase of EF of 61.5% (P < 0.01). A further increase of the resting pressure to 40 and 60 mmHg achieved an increase of the EF of 91% and 98%, respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusions: In patients with venous pumping failure, inelastic bandages produce a significant pressure-dependent increase of EF. A significant improvement in venous pumping function was achieved with inelastic bandages even at a resting pressure of 20 mmHg.","A too high resting pressure of compression devices, or when the device is just lying on the skin, is poorly tolerated and may cause skin defects. This is especially common in patients with concomitant arterial occlusive disease, blockage of an artery. The goal of this study was to investigate if low compression pressure improves vein pumping function in patients with defective veins. Vein pumping function was assessed (measured) in 20 patients with severe reflux, or the backup of blood, in the great saphenous vein in the leg. This was done by measuring ejection fraction (EF; percentage of blood leaving the heart when it contracts). Measurements were taken after application of knee-high medical compression stockings and of inelastic bandages applied while lying down. Results showed EF was significantly reduced compared with healthy controls. Compression stockings produced a moderate, non-significant improvement of EF. Inelastic bandages led to a significant increase of EF. Increased pressure of the inelastic bandages achieved an increase of the EF. The study concluded that, in patients with venous (vein) pumping failure, inelastic bandages produce a significant pressure-dependent increase of EF. This means that as pressure increases, EF increases. Significant improvement in venous pumping function was achieved with inelastic bandages, even at resting pressures.","A too high pressure from compression devices is poorly tolerated and may causes skin damage, espeically in those with blocked blood vessels in limbs. We aim to check if low compression pressure may improve blood vessel pumping in patients with impaired blood vessels. Blood vessel pumping function was measured in 20 patients with severely impaired blood flow in the body's largest vein. Measurements were repeated after using knee-high compression socks and inelastic bandages applied with low, medium, and high pressure while lying down. The amount of blood pumped was compared to healthy patients. Compression socks exerted an average pressure of 27 mmHg while lying down and slightly higher pressure of 30.5 mmHg while standing. This led to a minor improvement in the amount of blood pumped, or ejection fraction (EF), by 17%. Inelastic bandages with a pressure of 20.5 mmHg while lying down led to a standing pressure of 36 mmHg, which led to a major increase in EF by 61.5%. A larger increase of pressure to 40 and 60 mmHg led to an increase in the amount of blood pumped of 91% and 98%, respectively. In those with impaired blood vessel pumping, inelastic bandages lead to a pressure-dependent increase of EF. Inelastic bandages even with a pressure of 20 mmHg improved blood vessel pumping."
17,1233473,"180 cases of head trauma were classified according to the degree of impairment of consciousness, clinical and neurological symptoms and EEG patterns. Based on the radiological and clinical findings and blood gas analyses a study was made of the incidence and extent of aspiration of blood, vomit or debris into the tracheo-bronchial tree and of the resultant pulmonary complications. As loss of consciousness became more complete the incidence of aspiration and the amount of material inhaled increased. Clinically and radiologically proven aspiration occurred in 60 per cent of cases of severe head trauma. A comparison of two groups after they had been given first aid and artificial respiration showed that the paO2 values were significantly lower in patients with radiologically proven aspiration and infiltration of the lungs than they were in those with normal chest radiograms. These observations point to the relationship between the quantity of material inhaled and the extent of intra-pulmonary shunting. There was no difference in the incidence of aspiration between persons who had been intubated and those who had not been intubated prior to admission to hospital. Although in many cases of head trauma aspiration of blood immediately after the accident can not be prevented prompt intubation is the only measure that will mitigate the consequences of aspiration and prevent its recurrence. As the latter is a very real risk in the unconscious person intubation in these cases is a ""must"". The study also showed that aspiration of foreign material into the tracheobronchial system and the resultant pulmonary complications can be successfully treated even if the head trauma is very severe. In none of the cases studied was death attributable to these causes. Apart from intubation and bronchial toilet artificial respiration with oxygen-enriched gas mixtures has a decisive influence on the course of the aspiration-induced pulmonary complications.","180 cases of head trauma were classified by severity of damage to consciousness, medical and brain-related effects, and brain activity measurements. Based on x-rays, medical findings, and blood analyses, the frequency and extent of breathing in blood, vomit, or debris into the lungs and of its effects were measured. As consciousness decreased, the frequency and extent of breathing in material increased. Medically and x-ray proven breathing in of fluid occured in 60% of reports of severe head trauma. Comparing two groups after both received first aid and artificial breathing showed that oxygen was lower in patients with x-ray proven breathing in of fluids in the lungs than unaffected patients. A relationship exists between the amount inhaled and extent of fluid moved into the lungs. There was no change in the frequency of breathing in fluids between patients with breathing tubes and those without before arriving to the hospital. In many cases, while breathing in of blood cannot be stopped after head trauma, prompt use of breathing tubes is the only way to lessen the effects of breathing in fluids and prevent its return. Breathing in fluids again is a serious risk. For unconscious patients, breathing tubes are a ""must"". The study showed that breathing in foreign material into the lungs and the resulting effects can be treated even with severe head trauma. In no cases studied was death owing to these causes. Besides adding tubes and removing lung waste, artificial breathing in of oxygen-enriched gases greatly influence breathing-related effects.","We divided 180 cases of head injury based on the level of loss of wakefulness and awareness, medical and brain-related symptoms observed by a doctor, and a common brain function test. Based on x-rays, symptoms observed by a doctor, and blood gas tests, we studied how often and how much blood, vomit or debris entered the airways and the lung complications that occurred as a result. As consciousness went away, how often material entered the airways and the amount of material breathed in increased. Material entering the airways happened in 60 percent of cases of severe head injury based on symptoms observed by a doctor and x-rays. A comparison of two groups after they received first aid and artificial aid to breathe showed that the levels of oxygen dissolved in the blood were much lower in patients with x-rays that showed material entered the airways and the lungs than those with normal chest x-rays. These findings suggest a relationship between the amount of material breathed in and how much blood put out by the heart lacks enough oxygen. Persons who had a breathing tube and those who did not before admission to the hospital did not differ in how often material entered the airways. Although often in head injuries blood entering the airways after the accident cannot be prevented quickly, putting in a breathing tube is the only thing that will lessen the consequences of material entering the airways and prevent it from happening again. As the second result is a very real risk in the unconscious person, putting in a breathing tube in these cases is a ""must"". The study also showed that material from outside the body entering the airways and the lung complications that occurred as a result can be successfully treated even if the head injury is very severe. In the cases we looked at, death did not result from any of these causes. Aside from putting in a breathing tube and clearing mucus and secretions from the airways, substituting a person's breathing with gas mixtures with high levels of oxygen plays a big role in lung complications from material entering the airways."

27,34559576,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has galvanized the development of new vaccines at an unprecedented pace. Since the widespread implementation of vaccination campaigns, reports of ocular adverse effects after COVID-19 vaccinations have emerged. This review summarizes ocular adverse effects possibly associated with COVID-19 vaccination, and discusses their clinical characteristics and management. Results: Ocular adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations include facial nerve palsy, abducens nerve palsy, acute macular neuroretinopathy, central serous retinopathy, thrombosis, uveitis, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease reactivation, and new-onset Graves' Disease. Studies in current literature are primarily retrospective case series or isolated case reports - these are inherently weak in establishing association or causality. Nevertheless, the described presentations resemble the reported ocular manifestations of the COVID-19 disease itself. Hence, we hypothesize that the human body's immune response to COVID-19 vaccinations may be involved in the pathogenesis of the ocular adverse effects post-COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusion: Ophthalmologists and generalists should be aware of the possible, albeit rare, ocular adverse effects after COVID-19 vaccination.","The pandemic of Covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) has led to the development of new vaccines at an very fast pace. Since the start of major efforts to promote vaccination, reports of ocular adverse effects, which are side effects that impact the eyes or the face near the eyes, after Covid-19 vaccinations have emerged. This review summarizes these ocular adverse effects that are possibly associated with Covid-19 vaccines and discusses their medical traits and how to care for these effects. Ocular adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccinations include weakness or paralysis in the facial muscles, problems with eye movement, blind or blurry spots, distorted vision due to fluid build up in the eye, blood clots in the veins or arteries, inflammation (redness or swelling from fighting an infection) inside the eye, inflammation in the retina of the eye, rapid vision loss from previous diseases, and newly-contracted Graves' Disease, a condition that increases thyroid (metabolism-regulating) hormones and can impact the skin and eyes. Published studies mainly use existing information from previous cases or isolated reports; these are weak studies in establishing association or cause and effect. However, the described cases are similar, regarding the impact on the eyes or vision, to the Covid-19 disease itself. Researchers have a theory that the body's immune response to Covid-19 vaccinations may be involved in the development of the ocular adverse effects that occur after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. Eye surgeons and doctors should be aware of the possible, although rare, ocular adverse effects that impact the eyes after a Covid-19 vaccine.",
45,28639707,"Background: Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both. Dressings are widely used to treat pressure ulcers and promote healing, and there are many options to choose from including alginate, hydrocolloid and protease-modulating dressings. Topical agents have also been used as alternatives to dressings in order to promote healing. A clear and current overview of all the evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding the use of dressings or topical agents for the treatment of pressure ulcers. Such a review would ideally help people with pressure ulcers and health professionals assess the best treatment options. This review is a network meta-analysis (NMA) which assesses the probability of complete ulcer healing associated with alternative dressings and topical agents. Main results: We included 51 studies (2947 participants) in this review and carried out NMA in a network of linked interventions for the sole outcome of probability of complete healing. The network included 21 different interventions (13 dressings, 6 topical agents and 2 supplementary linking interventions) and was informed by 39 studies in 2127 participants, of whom 783 had completely healed wounds. We judged the network to be sparse: overall, there were relatively few participants, with few events, both for the number of interventions and the number of mixed treatment contrasts; most studies were small or very small. The consequence of this sparseness is high imprecision in the evidence, and this, coupled with the (mainly) high risk of bias in the studies informing the network, means that we judged the vast majority of the evidence to be of low or very low certainty. We have no confidence in the findings regarding the rank order of interventions in this review (very low-certainty evidence), but we report here a summary of results for some comparisons of interventions compared with saline gauze. We present here only the findings from evidence which we did not consider to be very low certainty, but these reported results should still be interpreted in the context of the very low certainty of the network as a whole. It is not clear whether regimens involving protease-modulating dressings increase the probability of pressure ulcer healing compared with saline gauze (risk ratio (RR) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 2.94) (moderate-certainty evidence: low risk of bias, downgraded for imprecision). This risk ratio of 1.65 corresponds to an absolute difference of 102 more people healed with protease modulating dressings per 1000 people treated than with saline gauze alone (95% CI 13 fewer to 302 more). It is unclear whether the following interventions increase the probability of healing compared with saline gauze (low-certainty evidence): collagenase ointment (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.22); foam dressings (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.26); basic wound contact dressings (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.58) and polyvinylpyrrolidone plus zinc oxide (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.37 to 4.62); the latter two interventions both had confidence intervals consistent with both a clinically important benefit and a clinically important harm, and the former two interventions each had high risk of bias as well as imprecision. Authors' conclusions: A network meta-analysis (NMA) of data from 39 studies (evaluating 21 dressings and topical agents for pressure ulcers) is sparse and the evidence is of low or very low certainty (due mainly to risk of bias and imprecision). Consequently we are unable to determine which dressings or topical agents are the most likely to heal pressure ulcers, and it is generally unclear whether the treatments examined are more effective than saline gauze. More research is needed to determine whether particular dressings or topical agents improve the probability of healing of pressure ulcers. The NMA is uninformative regarding which interventions might best be included in a large trial, and it may be that research is directed towards prevention, leaving clinicians to decide which treatment to use on the basis of wound symptoms, clinical experience, patient preference and cost.","Bedsores are areas of injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both, found in a certain part of the body. Doctors often use dressings to treat bedsores and promote healing, and there are many options to choose from. Doctors have also used medications applied to the skin instead of dressings to promote healing. A clear and current summary of the scientific data is needed to help make decisions about the use of dressings or medicines applied to the skin to treat bedsores. This review would ideally help people with bedsores and doctors decide the best treatment options. This review compares multiple studies to measure the likelihood of complete ulcer (bedsore) healing based on different dressings and medicines applied to the skin. We included 51 studies (2947 people) in this review and compared treatments based on the likelihood of complete healing. We compared 21 different treatments (13 dressings, 6 medicines applied to the skin and 2 mixed treatments) and looked at 39 studies in 2127 people, 783 of whom had completely healed wounds. We thought the data were limited, with relatively few participants, with few wounds, both for the number of treatments and the number of mixed treatments, and mostly small or very small studies. We thought that most of the data were low or very low quality due to unclear data combined with high likelihood of misleading results. We are not sure our ranking of interventions (treatments) is correct, but we summarize our results to compare treatments to saline gauze often used to as a wound dressing. We report only results from data we did not think was low quality, but these reported results should be considered keeping in mind the overall low certainty of data used. We are not sure whether protease-modulating (protein-altering) dressings increased the likelihood of bedsore healing compared to saline gauze. For every 1000 people, 102 more people healed with protease modulating dressings than people treated with only saline gauze. We are not sure collagenase (enzyme) ointment, foam dressings, basic wound contact dressings, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (water-soluble biological molecule) plus zinc oxide increased the likelihood of bedsore healing compared to saline gauze. We conclude that comparing data from 39 studies (rating 21 dressings and medicines applied to the skin for bedsores) is limited and the data are not reliable (due to unclear data and high likelihood of misleading results). Therefore, we cannot tell which dressings or medicines applied to the skin are the most likely to heal bedsores nor whether the treatments we looked at work better than saline gauze. More research is needed to find out whether certain dressings or medicines applied to the skin improve the likelihood of bedsore healing. Our study does not help decide which treatments might best be part of a large trial, and studies may need to focus on prevention, leaving doctors to decide which treatment to use based on wound symptoms, professional experience, what the patients want and cost.","Pressure ulcers, or bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries are restricted areas of injury to the skin or underlying body tissue, or both. Dressings (ointment or gauze to cover wounds) are widely used to treat pressure ulcers and promote healing. THere are many varied dressings to choose from. Skin-level agents also have been used as alternatives to dressings for healing. A clear and current overview of all the evidence is required to help make decisions regarding using dressings or skin-level agents to treat pressure ulcers. This review would ideally help those with pressure ulcers and health professionals choose treatments. This review is a study which assesses the probability of complete ulcer healing associated with alternative dressings and skin-level treatments. We included 51 studies (2947 participants) in this review and analyzed the treatments solely to measure the probability of complete healing. The study included 21 different treatments (13 dressings, 6 skin-level treatments, and 2 additional linking treatments). It included data from 39 studies in 2127 participants, of whom 783 had completely healed wounds. We judged the study network to be scattered. Overall, there were few participants, with few events, both for number of treatments and mixed treatment analysis. Most studies were small or very small. The effect of this sparseness is low reliability in the evidence. This, along with the (mainly) high risk of bias (or prejudice) in the studies, means we judged the majority of evidence to be low or very low quality. We have no confidence in the results regarding the rank order of treatments in this review (very low-quality evidence), but we report a summary of results for some comparisons of treatments compared with standard gauze. We present here only results from evidence we did not consdier to be very low quality, but the reported results should be interpreted while knowing of the very low quality regarding the whole study network. It is not clear if treatments with special protein-breakdown dressings increase the probability of pressure ulcer healing compared with standard gauze. 102 more people were healed with special protein-breakdown dressings per 1000 people than those with standard gauze alone. It is unclear if any of the other treatments examined increase the probability of healing compared with standard gauze (low-quality evidence). Some showed metrics consistent with a clinically important benefit and harm. Others had a high risk of bias and unreliability. A large analysis of data from 39 studies (examining 21 dressings and skin-level agents for pressure ulcers) is scattered. The evidence is also of low or very low quality (due to risk of bias and unreliability). Therefore, we are unable to determine which dressings or skin-level agents are best to heal pressure ulcers. It is unclear whether the treatments are more effective than standard gauze.

Despite the development of chemical, radiological, and immunotherapies, many patients do not benefit from these therapies, as recurrence is common. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis using Fluidigm C1 systems to characterize human lung cancer transcriptomes at single-cell resolution. Validation of scRNA-seq differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) found a positive correlation in fold-change values between C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) and 2 (CXCL2) compared with bulk-cell level in 34 primary lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) from Stage I patients. Furthermore, we discovered an inverse correlation between chemokine mRNAs, miR-532-5p, and miR-1266-3p in early-stage primary LUADs. Specially, miR-532-5p was quantifiable in plasma from the corresponding LUADs. Collectively, we identified markers of early-stage lung cancer that were validated in primary lung tumors and circulating blood.","Lung cancer accounts for more than half of the new cancers diagnosed world-wide. Lung cancer patients have poor survival rates. Despite the development of several therapy types, many patients do not benefit from these therapies. Recurrence, or the return of lung cancer, is common. The authors performed an analysis to characterize human lung cancer transcriptomes at single-cell resolution. The transcriptome is the sum total of messenger RNA within the genetic material of an organism. The analysis found a positive correlation (link) between a gene and a chemokine, both with roles in a pro-inflammatory or infection-fighting response, in human lung cancer cells taken from cancer patients. Chemokines are signaling proteins that attract white blood cells to infection sites. Furthermore, the authors discovered an inverse (opposite) correlation between chemokine messenger RNAs and microRNAs in human lung cancer cells taken from cancer patients. MicroRNA is RNA that is not translated into functioning proteins. Specially, one microRNA (miR-532-5p) was measurable in plasma from the cells.

14,32780893,"COVID-19 may cause pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular alterations, and multiple organ failure, which have been ascribed to a cytokine storm, a systemic inflammatory response, and an attack by the immune system. Moreover, an oxidative stress imbalance has been demonstrated to occur in COVID-19 patients. N- Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a precursor of reduced glutathione (GSH). Due to its tolerability, this pleiotropic drug has been proposed not only as a mucolytic agent, but also as a preventive/therapeutic agent in a variety of disorders involving GSH depletion and oxidative stress. At very high doses, NAC is also used as an antidote against paracetamol intoxication. Thiols block the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 thereby hampering penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into cells. Based on a broad range of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, which are herein reviewed, the oral administration of NAC is likely to attenuate the risk of developing COVID-19, as it was previously demonstrated for influenza and influenza-like illnesses. Moreover, high-dose intravenous NAC may be expected to play an adjuvant role in the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases and in the control of its lethal complications, also including pulmonary and cardiovascular adverse events.","COVID-19 (a viral breathing-related disorder) may cause diseases such as pneumonia (lung infection), heart-related changes, and multiple organ failure, which has been related to cytokine storm (an immune reaction where the body releases too many cytokines, which play a role in the body's normal immune response, into the blood too quickly), a systematic inflammatory response (the body's natural reaction against injury and infection in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues), and an attack by the immune system. Also, an oxidative stress imbalance, which can lead to cell and tissue damage, has been shown to occur in COVID-19 patients. N- Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is used to build antioxidants (vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells), and its presence may be followed by reduced, or charged, glutathione (GSH), a key antioxidant that protects tissues and cells. NAC may be a potential preventive drug for a variety of disorders that involve GSH depletion and oxidative stress. At very high doses, N- Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is also used as a medicine against paracetamol intoxication (too much of a common oral medication called Acetaminophen used for pain and reducing fevers). NAC may help prevent SARS-CoV-2, the virus leading to COVID-19, from entering cells. NAC taken orally (by mouth) is likely to weaken the risk of developing COVID-19. Also, high-does N- Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) taken intravenously (medication delivered through the vein) may play a role in expanding the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases and help control lung and heart complications.",
14,32471251,"The coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) was announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Challenges arise concerning how to optimally support the immune system in the general population, especially under self-confinement. An optimal immune response depends on an adequate diet and nutrition in order to keep infection at bay. For example, sufficient protein intake is crucial for optimal antibody production. Low micronutrient status, such as of vitamin A or zinc, has been associated with increased infection risk. Frequently, poor nutrient status is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn can impact the immune system. Dietary constituents with especially high anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity include vitamin C, vitamin E, and phytochemicals such as carotenoids and polyphenols. Several of these can interact with transcription factors such as NF-kB and Nrf-2, related to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, respectively. Vitamin D in particular may perturb viral cellular infection via interacting with cell entry receptors (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), ACE2. Dietary fiber, fermented by the gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids, has also been shown to produce anti-inflammatory effects. In this review, we highlight the importance of an optimal status of relevant nutrients to effectively reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby strengthening the immune system during the COVID-19 crisis.","The coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral breathing-related disease, was announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Challenges arise on how to best support the immune system (a complex network of tissues, organs, cells, and proteins that defends the body against infection) in the general population. The best immune response depends on enough food and nutrition in order to keep infections away. For example, eating enough protein is important for producing antibodies (a protective protein used by the immune system in response to an infection). A lack of nutrients (vitamins and minerals) in the body, such as vitamin A or zinc, is associated with an increased risk of infection. Frequently, low nutrient status in the body is associated with inflammation (the body's response to injury or infection often causing swelling, pain, or redness) and oxidative stress (a condition that happens when nutrients and minerals that protect cells are low), which can impact the immune system. Foods that can help relieve inflammation and have antioxidants (vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells) have vitamin C, vitamin E, and phytochemicals (compounds found in fruits and vegetables).

The age distribution is bimodal with the highest incidence in childhood and after 50 years of age. Diagnosis is usually reached through clinical examination of a lump in the inguinal region although some patients can present with intestinal obstruction. Inguinal hernia repair is the only definitive treatment and is one of the most common surgical procedures performed. It is usually performed as an elective procedure in local, spinal or general anasthesia. The repair constitutes of reinforcing the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, often using a polypropylene mesh; either via an open anterior approach or posteriorly from within the abdomen with laparoscopy. The most common complications following a hernia repair are recurrent hernia and chronic -discomfort but recurrence rates have improved with the use of mesh and laparoscopic techniques.

28,34517257,"Background: Inflammation-mediated lung injury is a major cause of health problems in many countries and has been the leading cause of morbidity/mortality in intensive care units. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of the patients experienced serious pneumonia resulting from inflammation (Acute respiratory distress syndrome/ARDS). Pathogenic infections cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS) by hyperactivation of immune cells, which in turn release excessive cytokines causing ARDS. Currently, there are no standard therapies for viral, bacterial or pathogen-mediated CRS. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate and validate the protective effects of Dehydrozingerone (DHZ) against LPS induced lung cell injury by in-vitro and in-vivo models and to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that mediate these therapeutic effects. Methods: The therapeutic activity of DHZ was determined in in-vitro models by pre-treating the cells with DHZ and exposed to LPS to stimulate the inflammatory cascade of events. We analysed the effect of DHZ on LPS induced inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cell damage markers expression/levels using various cell lines. We performed gene expression, ELISA, and western blot analysis to elucidate the effect of DHZ on inflammation and its modulation of MAPK and NF-κB pathways. Further, the prophylactic and therapeutic effect of DHZ was evaluated against the LPS induced ARDS model in rats. Results: DHZ significantly (p < 0.01) attenuated the LPS induced ROS, inflammatory cytokine, chemokine gene expression and protein release in macrophages. Similarly, DHZ treatment protected the lung epithelial and endothelial cells by mitigating the LPS induced inflammatory events in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo analysis showed that DHZ treatment significantly (p < 0.001) mitigated the LPS induced ARDS pathophysiology of increase in the inflammatory cells in BALF, inflammatory cytokine and chemokines in lung tissues. LPS stimulated neutrophil-mediated events, apoptosis, alveolar wall thickening and alveolar inflammation were profoundly reduced by DHZ treatment in a rat model. Conclusion: This study demonstrates for the first time that DHZ has the potential to ameliorate LPS induced ARDS by inhibiting cytokine storm and oxidative through modulating the MAPK and NF-κB pathways. This data provides pre-clinical support to develop DHZ as a potential therapeutic agent against ARDS.","Lung injuries caused by inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) in the body is a major cause of health problems in several countries. Additionally, inflammation is a leading cause for disease and death within intensive care units (ICU) in hospitals. The majority of patients of COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related or respiratory disease) have suffered from a condition known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that results from inflammation. It is similar to pneumonia (lung infection). Infections within the body can trigger the excess release of cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that can tell your immune system what to do. Sometimes, when we are sick, cytokines stimulate too many immune cells, causing hyperactivation, which in turn causes more cytokines to release more signals. This causes a biological loop known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that results in ARDS. Currently, there are no medical treatments to prevent CRS that is causes by viruses, bacteria, or germs. The goal of this paper was to better understand how a chemical, known as Dehydrozingerone (DHZ), can protect lung cells from damage caused by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). LPS are molecules that exist within the cell walls of bacteria and are extremely toxic. This study used two types of studies, in vitro (in cells) and in vivo (in animals), to fully comprehend how DHZ can prevent LPS-induced lung cell injury. For the in vitro study, cells were treated with DHZ before being exposed to LPS. This caused a series of inflammatory events to occur within the treated cells. The authors reviewed how DHZ protected against LPS damage within several different types of cells. They performed several lab tests looking at cells' internal health to better determine the effect DHZ had on inflammation and how it was protective. Additionally, the authors determined how DHZ could prevent disease and protect against LPS within rats already sick with ARDS. Within one type of cell, DHZ significantly decreased the negative effects caused by LPS exposure. Similarly, DHZ protected lung cells by reducing LPS-induced inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. Meaning as the amount of DHZ given was increased, the symptoms from LPS treatment decreased. In the rats treated with DHZ, the chemical significantly reduced LPS-caused ARDS. DHZ significantly reduced several harmful effects of LPS within the rat model, including cell injury and cell death. This study is the first to show that DHZ has the ability to protect against ARDS by decreasing harmful immune responses triggered by LPS. This data provides support to develop DHZ as a potential human pharmaceutical prescription or drug to protect against ARDS.",

55,24473982,"Loss of function in mitochondria, the key organelle responsible for cellular energy production, can result in the excess fatigue and other symptoms that are common complaints in almost every chronic disease. At the molecular level, a reduction in mitochondrial function occurs as a result of the following changes: (1) a loss of maintenance of the electrical and chemical transmembrane potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane, (2) alterations in the function of the electron transport chain, or (3) a reduction in the transport of critical metabolites into mitochondria. In turn, these changes result in a reduced efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation and a reduction in production of adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP).

52,30811826,"The pathogenesis of Turner syndrome (TS) and the genotype-phenotype relationship has been thoroughly investigated during the last decade. It has become evident that the phenotype seen in TS does not only depend on simple gene dosage as a result of X chromosome monosomy. The origin of TS specific comorbidities such as infertility, cardiac malformations, bone dysgenesis, and autoimmune diseases may depend on a complex relationship between genes as well as transcriptional and epigenetic factors affecting gene expression across the genome. Furthermore, two individuals with TS with the exact same karyotype may exhibit completely different traits, suggesting that no conventional genotype-phenotype relationship exists. Here, we review the different genetic mechanisms behind differential gene expression, and highlight potential key-genes essential to the comorbidities seen in TS and other X chromosome aneuploidy syndromes. KDM6A, important for germ cell development, has shown to be differentially expressed and methylated in Turner and Klinefelter syndrome across studies. Furthermore, TIMP1/TIMP3 genes seem to affect the prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve. KDM5 C could play a role in the neurocognitive development of Turner and Klinefelter syndrome. However, further research is needed to elucidate the genetic mechanism behind the phenotypic variability and the different phenotypic traits seen in TS.","The disease development of Turner syndrome (TS), and how gene expression effects physical appearance, has been heavily investigated over the last decade. Turner syndrome is a condition where there is an abnormal amount of chromosomes (genetic material). Phenotype (observable characteristics) seen in TS does not only depend on the number of copies of a gene as a result of X chromosome monosomy. Monosomy indicates there is an absence of one member of a chromosome pair; instead of 46 chromosomes in each cell of the body, there is 45. The origin of TS specific comorbidities (presence of two or more diseases) may depend on crosstalk between genes as well as factors affecting gene expression. These comorbidities include infertility, heart-related malformations, defective bone development, and autoimmune diseases (in which immune cells attack healthy cells). Furthermore, two people with TS with the exact same karyotype, number and visual appear of chromosomes, may exhibit completely different traits. This suggests that no conventional genotype-phenotype relationship exists. This study reviews the different genetic mechanisms behind differential (function-unique) gene expression. This study also highlights potential key-genes essential to the comorbidities seen in TS and other X chromosome aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome number) syndromes. KDM6A, a gene important for germ cell development, has shown to be differentially expressed and methylated in Turner and Klinefelter syndrome (male born with extra X chromosome copy) patients. Furthermore, TIMP1/TIMP3 genes seem to affect the prevalence (amount) of bicuspid aortic valve, an abnormality in the aortic valve of the heart. KDM5 C could play a role in the brain- and memory-related development of Turner and Klinefelter syndrome. However, further research is needed to determine the genetic mechanism behind the phenotypic variability and the different phenotypic traits seen in TS.",
38,30422492,"Wound pressure injuries have been given various names over the last several years. In the past, they were referred to as pressure ulcers, decubitus ulcers, or bed sores; and now they are most commonly termed ""pressure injuries."" Pressure injuries are defined as the breakdown of skin integrity due to some types of unrelieved pressure. This can be from a bony area on the body coming into contact with an external surface which leads to pressure injury. These wounds represent the destruction of normal structure and function of the skin and soft tissue through a variety of mechanisms and etiologies. The wound healing process is affected by various factors including infection, the presence of chronic diseases like diabetes, aging, nutritional deficiency like vitamin C, medications like steroids, and low perfusion of oxygen and blood flow to the wound in cases of hypoxia and cold temperature. Pressure ulcers result from long periods of repeated pressure applied to the skin, soft tissue, muscle, and bone. In pressure ulcers, the external pressure exceeds capillary closing pressure.","Wound pressure injuries have various names over the last few years.

18,32537643,"Background: Lower carbohydrate diets have the potential to improve glycemia but may increase ketonemia in women with gestational diabetes (GDM). We hypothesized that modestly lower carbohydrate intake would not increase ketonemia. Objective: To compare blood ketone concentration, risk of ketonemia, and pregnancy outcomes in women with GDM randomly assigned to a lower carbohydrate diet or routine care. Methods: Forty-six women aged (mean ± SEM) 33.3 ± 0.6 y and prepregnancy BMI 26.8 ± 0.9 kg/m2 were randomly assigned at 28.5 ± 0.4 wk to a modestly lower carbohydrate diet (MLC, ∼135 g/d carbohydrate) or routine care (RC, ∼200 g/d) for 6 wk. Blood ketones were ascertained by finger prick test strips and 3-d food diaries were collected at baseline and end of the intervention. Results: There were no detectable differences in blood ketones between completers in the MLC group compared with the RC group (0.1 ± 0.0 compared with 0.1 ± 0.0 mmol/L, n = 33, P = 0.31, respectively), even though carbohydrate and total energy intake were significantly lower in the intervention group (carbohydrate 165 ± 7 compared with 190 ± 9 g, P = 0.04; energy 7040 ± 240 compared with 8230 ± 320 kJ, P <0.01, respectively). Only 20% of participants in the MLC group met the target intake compared with 65% in the RC group (P <0.01). There were no differences in birth weight, rate of large-for-gestational-age infants, percent fat mass, or fat-free mass between groups. Conclusions: An intervention to reduce carbohydrate intake in GDM did not raise ketones to clinical significance, possibly because the target of 135 g/d was difficult to achieve in pregnancy. Feeding studies with food provision may be needed to assess the benefits and risks of low-carbohydrate diets.","A low carbohydrate diet (a diet that limits carbohydrates often found in sugary foods, pasta, and bread) has the potential to improve glycemia (blood sugar level) but it may increase ketonemia (an unusually high amount of ketones, a substance that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar) in women with gestational diabetes (a type of high blood sugar affecting pregnant women). Researchers tested the theory that eating a modestly low amount of carbohydrates would not increase ketonemia. The objective of this study is to compare the amount of ketones that are in the blood, the risk of ketonemia, and pregnancy outcomes, such as full-term or premature, in women with gestational diabetes who are randomly assigned to a lower carbohydrate (carb) diet or routine care. In this study, 46 women are randomly assigned to a modestly lower carb diet or to routine care. Ketones, the substance the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar, in the blood are measured by finger prick tests. Food diaries are collected at the beginning of the study and at the end. The results show that there are no detectable differences in blood ketones between participants in the modestly lower carb diet group when compared with women in the routine care group, even though carbs and total energy intake are much lower in the modestly low carb diet group. Only 20% of participants in the modestly low carb diet group met the target amount of consumption compared with 65% in the routine care group. There are no differences in birth weight, rate of large-for-gestational-age infants (a newborn who weighs more than 90% of other newborns of the same gestational age at birth), percent of fat in the body, or fat-free mass (muscle mass) between the groups. In conclusion, a change to reduce the amount of carbs consumed by women with gestational diabetes did not raise ketones to a significant level, possibly because the target of the amount of food was difficult to achieve in pregnancy. Feeding studies with provided food may be needed to determine the benefits and risks of low-carbohydrate diets.","Lower carb diets may improve blood sugar but may increase blood ketone bodies (particles made from fat breakdown) in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) (high blood sugar affecting pregnant women). We presume that fairly lower carbohydrate intake would not increase blood ketone bodies. To compare levels of blood ketone made from fat breakdown, risk of high blood ketone bodies, and pregnancy outcomes in women with gestational diabetes randomly given a lower carb diet or regular care. Forty-six women around 33 years of age were randomly split at 28.5 weeks to either a modestly lower carb diet (MLC) or standard, routine care (RC) for 6 weeks. There was no difference in blood ketones between those in the MLC diet group relative to the RC group, even though carb and total energy intake was lower in the diet group. Only 20% in the MLC diet group met the goal intake versus the 65% in the RC group. No differences in birth weight, rate of large-for-prenatal-age infants, percent fat mass, or fat-free mass between groups existed.

24,8588056,"1. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects and abrupt discontinuation of buspirone 15 or 20 mg tid and lorazepam 3 or 4 mg tid following 8 weeks of treatment. A total of 43 outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder were included in the study and 39 entered the withdrawal phase. 2. Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks (active phase) and after 9 and 10 weeks (withdrawal phase). These included the Hamilton anxiety scale, the visual analogue scale, the CHESS 84 (a check list for the evaluation of somatic symptoms) and the Lader tranquilizer withdrawal scale (translated in french). 3. Results show similar efficacy for lorazepam and buspirone during the active phase with a higher significant difference for buspirone on the CHESS 84 in relation with neurovegetatives symptoms: lorazepam D0 :16.30 +/- 3.14 D56: 5.10 +/- 0.93 (p < or = 0.01) buspirone D0 :18.82 +/- 3.4 D56: 4.73 +/- 1.18 (p < or = 0.001). No withdrawal phenomena was observed for both drugs using HAM-A lorazepam D63 :12.59 +/- 2.26 D70: 12.0 +/- 1.75 (p = ns) buspirone D63 :10.05 +/- 1.28 D70: 10.32 +/- 1.82 (p = ns) and the same significant difference using Lader scale: lorazepam D63 :4.44 +/- 0.89 D70: 6.96 +/- 1.28 (p < or = 0.05) buspirone D63 :2.95 +/- 0.66 D70: 4.15 +/- 0.92 (p < or = 0.05) 4. This study confirmed that buspirone was as effective as lorazepam at D56 in monitored outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder. There are some evidences that these two drugs differed in efficacy against the various somatic symptoms encountered in generalized anxiety disorder.","This study compares the effects and abrupt stoppage of anxiety-reducing buspirone drug use (15 or 20 mg three times a day) and anxiety-reducing lorazepam drug use (3 or 4 mg three times a day) after 8 weeks of treatment. 43 patients with diagnosed anxiety participated in the study. 39 entered the drug withdrawal phase. Clinical measurements were taken at start, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks (active phase) and after 9 and 10 weeks (withdrawal phase). Lorazepam and buspirone had similar effectiveness when used. However, buspirone affected sleep, appetite, and concentration differently compared to lorazepam. No withdrawal effects were seen with either drug. Buspirone was as effective as lorazepam with patients with diagnosed anxiety. Buspirone may have differed in effectiveness compared to lorazepam for treating certain physical symptoms common with anxiety disorder.","This study's purpose was to compare the effects and sudden termination of buspirone 15 or 20 mg three times a day and lorazepam 3 or 4 mg three times a day, common anxiety-reducing drugs. We included 43 patients outside the hospital with generalized anxiety disorder in the study, and 39 quickly stopped taking medication. We collected information from patients at the beginning of the study, at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks (active phase), and after 9 and 10 weeks (withdrawal phase). These assessments included common questionnaires measuring severity of anxiety symptoms. Results show lorazepam and buspirone worked similarly well during the active phase with one questionnaire favoring buspirone for physical symptoms of anxiety (e.g., fatigue). No withdrawal symptoms were seen for both lorazepam and buspirone using one of the questionnaires, and the same significant difference was seen using another questionnaire. This study showed that buspirone worked as well as lorazepam 56 days into the study in patients with generalized anxiety disorder. Some results suggest that lorazepam and buspirone did not work the same against the physical symptoms seen in generalized anxiety disorder."
19,32804544,"Introduction: Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with levodopa is hampered by motor complications related to the inability of residual nigrostriatal neurons to convert levodopa to dopamine (DA) and use it appropriately. This generated a tendency to postpone levodopa, favoring the initial use of DA agonists, which directly stimulate striatal dopaminergic receptors. Use of DA agonists, however, is associated with multiple side effects and their efficacy is limited by suboptimal bioavailability. Areas covered: This paper reviewed the latest preclinical and clinical findings on the efficacy and adverse effects of non-ergot DA agonists, discussing the present and future of this class of compounds in PD therapy. Expert opinion: The latest findings confirm the effectiveness of DA agonists as initial treatment or adjunctive therapy to levodopa in advanced PD, but a more conservative approach to their use is emerging, due to the complexity and repercussions of their side effects. As various factors may increase the individual risk to side effects, assessing such risk and calibrating the use of DA agonists accordingly may become extremely important in the clinical management of PD, as well as the availability of new DA agonists with better profiles of safety and efficacy.","Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease with levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) is slowed down by motor (movement) complications related to the inability of neurons to convert levodopa to dopamine (a chemical messenger that carries signals between brain cells and affects mood, motivation, and movement) and use it appropriately. This problem often leads to delaying the use of levodopa and using dopamine agonists (a medication that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body to relieve symptoms related to low levels of dopamine), which directly stimulates dopamine receptors or target sites in the brain. Using dopamine agonists, however, is connected with multiple side effects. Their performance is limited by the drug not being completely available to the intended part of the body. This paper reviews the latest findings from animal and human studies on the performance and negative effects of non-ergot dopamine agonists (newer types of drugs that imitate the effects of dopamine), discussing the present and future of this type of drug in Parkinson's disease. The latest findings confirm the effectiveness of dopamine agonists as the first treatment and as an additional drug to use with levodopa in advanced Parkinson's disease, but a more moderate approach to their use is emerging due to their side effects. As different factors may increase the risk to side effects, evaluating such risk and adjusting the use of dopamine agonists may become extremely important in the care of Parkinson's disease, as well as the availability of new dopamine agonists drugs with better safety and performance documented.",
10,32365314,"Importance: Hand osteoarthritis is a musculoskeletal problem that is associated with hand pain, stiffness, functional limitation, decreased grip strength, and reduced quality of life. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of nighttime orthoses on the second or third finger of the dominant hand in controlling pain in women with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) in the interphalangeal joint. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Outpatient clinic. Participants: Fifty-two women with symptomatic OA and presence of Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes, allocated randomly to the intervention group or the control group. Intervention: The intervention group used a nighttime orthosis on the second or third finger of the dominant hand. Both groups participated in an educational session. Outcomes and measures: The following parameters were measured: pain (numerical rating scale, Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index), grip and pinch strength, function (Cochin Hand Functional Scale), and manual performance (Moberg Pick Up Test). Results: The intervention group showed a statistically significant improvement in pain (p < .001) and hand function. The improvement in pain correlated with Cochin Hand Functional Scale scores and the absence of Bouchard's nodes in the third finger, which are predictors of the best prognosis for treatment with a nighttime orthosis. Conclusions and relevance: This study demonstrates that nighttime orthoses are effective in reducing pain and lead to improvement in hand function in women with hand OA. They are therefore specifically recommended for nonpharmacological treatment of hand OA. What this article adds: Orthoses can be considered, together with manual exercises and joint protection, as an intervention to reduce symptoms and improve hand function in people with hand OA. This study is an important step in empowering occupational therapists to determine appropriate and effective intervention for clients with OA.","Hand osteoarthritis is a problem that is associated with hand pain, stiffness, inability to perform normal functional movements, decreased grip strength, and reduced quality of life. A nighttime orthosis is a device or brace worn at night that supports weak or damaged muscles and limits motion of the wrist. The objective of this study is to evaluate how helpful using nighttime orthoses on the second or third finger of the dominant hand is in controlling pain in women who have osteoarthritis in the hinge joint of the fingers. This study used a randomized controlled trial, a type of study that randomly assigns participants to one of two groups: the intervention group that is receiving the treatment or the comparison group not receiving treatment. The study took place in an outpatient clinic away from a hospital. Fifty-two women with osteoarthritis and who also had bony bumps (also called nodes) on the finger joints closest to the fingernail and in the middle of the finger were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the comparison group. The intervention group used a nighttime orthosis on the second or third finger of the dominant hand. Both groups participated in an educational session. The following were measured in both groups: pain (using a numbered scale), grip and pinch strength, function (measuring the ability to move and use the hand for daily activities), and manual performance (using a timed test that involves picking up, holding, and operating small objects). The intervention group (group that used the orthoses) showed a significant improvement in pain and hand function. The improvement in pain matched with measures of movement and the absence of nodes in the middle of the finger on the third finger. This study shows that nighttime orthoses are effective in reducing pain and lead to improvement in hand function in women with hand osteoarthritis. They are therefore specifically recommended for treatment of hand osteoarthritis that does not involve medications. Orthoses can be considered, together with manual exercises and joint protection, as a way to reduce symptoms and improve hand function in people with hand osteoarthritis. This study is an important step in helping occupational therapists (people who help patients with injuries, illnesses, and disabilities build or restore their abilities to perform the daily tasks of life) find appropriate and useful treatments for clients with osteoarthritis.","Hand osteoarthritis is a musculoskeletal problem involving hand pain, stiffness, practical limitation, decreased grip strength, and reduced quality of life. The objective is to measure the use of nighttime braces on the second or third finger of the dominant hand in controlling pain in women with typical osteoarthritis (OA) in the finger knuckles.  Fifty-two women with typical OA and bony lumps in the finger knucles were randomly assigned to the treatment group or the control group. The treatment group used a nighttime brace on the second or third finger of the dominant hand. Both groups took part in an informational session. Pain, grip and pinch strength, funciton, and manual performance were measured. The treatment group showed a noticeable improvement in pain and hand function. The improvement in pain paralleled functionality test scores and the loss of bony lumps in the third finger. They are predictors of the best recovery for treatment with a nighttime brace. Nighttime braces are useful in reducing pain and improving hand function in women with hand osteoarthritis. They are recommended for non-medication treatment of hand osteoarthritis. Braces can be used, along with hand exercises and joint protection, to reduce symptoms and improve hand function in people with hand osteoarthritis.

13,30793493,"Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are associated. This study investigated the impact of AF intervention on 6-month home sleep testing data. Methods: Sixty-seven patients (aged 66 to 86, 53% male) with persistent AF were randomized (1:1:1) to direct current cardioversion (DCCV) (22 patients), permanent pacemaker (PPM) + atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) + DCCV (22 patients) or AF ablation (23 patients). Baseline and 6-month multichannel home sleep tests with the Watch-PAT200 (Itamar Medical Lts., Caesarea, Israel) were recorded. Implantable cardiac monitors (ICMs) (Medtronic Reveal XT, Minneapolis, Minnesota) in the DCCV and AF ablation groups, and PPM Holters in the 'pace and ablate' group were utilized to assess cardiac rhythm beat-to-beat throughout the study period. Results: The prevalence of moderate-to-severe SDB [apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) ≥ 15/h] was 60%. At 6 months there was no change in AHI, Epworth sleepiness scale, sleep time, % REM sleep, respiratory desaturation index or central apnoeic events. Twenty-five patients (15 AF ablation, 9 DCCV and 1 following DCCV post-AVNA) maintained SR at 6 months confirmed on ICMs in these patients. AHI fell from 29.8 ± 26.6/h to 22.2 ± 20.4/h; P = 0.049. Conclusions: SDB is highly prevalent in patients with persistent AF. Restoration of sinus rhythm, and the associated long-term recovery of haemodynamics, is associated with a significant reduction in AHI. This implicates reversal of fluid shift from the lower limbs to the neck region, a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of SDB.","There are associations between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts, and atrial fibrillation (AF), an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm that can lead to blood clots in the heart. This study investigates the impact of AF interventions and treatments on 6-month home sleep testing data. Sixty-seven patients with persistent (lasting longer than 7 days) atrial fibrillation were randomly put in 3 different treatment groups: 1) cardioversion (a procedure used to return an irregular or very fast heartbeat to a normal rhythm), 2) permanent pacemaker (a small device that is inserted under the skin of the chest to help the heart beat normally) with atrioventricular node ablation (heat energy to destroy a small amount of tissue between the upper and lower chambers of your heart) with cardioversion, or 3) AF ablation (using small burns or freezes to cause some scarring on the inside of the heart to help break up the electrical signals that cause irregular heartbeats). Home sleep tests were recorded at the start of the study and at 6 months. Other devices were used to monitor heart rhythm throughout the study period. The occurrence of moderate-to-severe SBD, that measured over 15 for apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), the number of breathing pauses or disruptions per hour while asleep, was found in more than half (60%) of patients. At six months there was no change in AHI, sleepiness during the day, sleep time, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and other tests that measure sleep and breathing patterns. At 6 months, 25 patients (15 from the AF ablation group) had a steady sinus rhythm, the pattern of your heartbeat based on the sinus node of your heart which sends out electrical pulses. AHI fell from 29.8 ± 26.6/h to 22.2 ± 20.4/h. In conclusion, sleep-disordered breathing is very common in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. Restoration of sinus rhythm, and the associated long-term recovery of normal heart function, is associated with a large reduction in AHI. This finding suggests that reversing fluid from the lower limbs to the neck area is a key process in the development of sleep-disordered breathing.","Sleep-disordered breathing and irregular heart beats are linked. This study examines irregular heart beat treatment on 6-month home sleep testing data. Sixty-seven patients (aged 66 to 86, 53% male) with long-lasting atrial fibrillation (irregular or rapid heart beat) were randomly grouped (1:1:1) to three standard treatments for atrial fibrillation.  The presence of moderate-to-severe sleep-disordered breathing [number of breathing interruptions during sleep ≥ 15/h] was 60%. At 6 months, there was no change in sleep-disordered breathing measurements. Twenty-five patients (with standard treatments for irregular heart beat) maintained sinus rhythm for 6 months confirmed on implanted heart beat monitors in these patients. Number of breathing interruptions during sleep fell from 29.8 ± 26.6/h to 22.2 ± 20.4/h. Sleep-disordered breathing is very present in patients with lasting irregular heart beats. Recovery of sinus rhythm, and the linked long-term recovery of blood flow, is linked with a noticeable reduction in the number of breathing interruptions during sleep. These fewer breathing interruptions during sleep imply reversal of fluid shift from the lower limbs to the neck region, which is key for causing sleep-disordered breathing."
16,15257071,"Background: Renal transplant recipients were noted to appear cushingoid while on low doses of steroid as part of a triple therapy immunosuppression of cyclosporin A (CsA), prednisolone, and azathioprine. Methods: The study group comprised adult renal transplant recipients with stable graft function who had received their renal allograft a minimum of 1 year previously (43 studies undertaken in 22 men and 20 women) with median daily prednisone dose of 7 mg (range 3-10). The control group was healthy nontransplant subjects [median dose 10 mg (10-30)]. Prednisolone bioavailability was measured using a limited 6-hour area under the curve (AUC), with prednisolone measured using specific HPLC assay. Results: The median prednisolone AUC/mg dose for all transplant recipients was significantly greater than the control group by approximately 50% (316 nmol x h/L/mg prednisolone versus 218). AUC was significantly higher in female recipients (median 415 versus 297 for men) and in recipients receiving cyclosporin (348 versus 285). The highest AUC was in women on estrogen supplements who were receiving cyclosporin (median 595). A significantly higher proportion of patients on triple therapy had steroid side effects compared with those on steroid and azathioprine (17/27 versus 4/15), more women than men had side effects (14/16 versus 7/22), and the AUC/mg prednisone was greater in those with side effects than without (median 377 versus 288 nmol x h/L/mg). Discussion: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that CsA increases the bioavailability of prednisolone, most likely through inhibition of P-glycoprotein. The increased exposure to steroid increased the side-effect profile of steroids in the majority of patients. Because the major contributor to AUC is the maximum postdose concentration, it may be possible to use single-point monitoring (2 hours postdose) for routine clinical studies.","People who received a renal (kidney) transplant appear cushingoid (having different symptoms, often facial puffiness and weight gain, due to too much of the hormone cortisol in the body) while on low doses of steroid as part of multiple drug treatments, including prednisolone. The study group has adult kidney transplant patients with stable functions within the transplanted kidney who got the kidney at least a year ago along with an average daily prednisone dose of 7 mg. The comparison group is healthy people who did not receive a transplant. Prednisolone bioavailability (how much of a drug becomes completely available to the intended part of the body) is measured using an area under the curve (a measure of total exposure to the drug in the body's systems), with prednisolone measured using HPLC, or high performance liquid chromatographic (a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze). The prednisolone area under the curve for all transplant patients is significantly greater than the comparison group of healthy non-transplant patients. Area under the curve measurements are much higher in females patients and in patients receiving cyclosporin, a drug that prevents the body from rejecting a transplant. The highest area under the curve measurement is in women on estrogen supplements (pills taken, often to resolve symptoms related to menopause) who are taking cyclosporin. A significantly higher proportion of patients on multiple-drug therapy had steroid side effects compared with those on steroid and azathioprine (a drug that can prevent organ rejection after a transplant). More women than men had side effects, and the area under the curve prednisone was greater in those with side effects than without. The results are consistent with the suggestion that cyclosporin A increases the bioavailability (how much of a drug becomes completely available to the intended part of the body) of prednisolone. The increased exposure to the steroid increased the side effects of steroids in most of the patients. It may be possible to use single-point monitoring (one time measurement) 2 hours after the dose for routine clinical studies.","Kidney transplant receivers appeared puffy and obese while on low doses of steroid from a three-part therapy of immunosuppressive drugs including cyclosporin A (CsA), prednisolone, and azathioprine. The treatment group had adult kidney transplant receivers with stable transplants who had received their kidney transplant at least 1 year ago (43 studies done in 22 men and 20 women) with average daily immunosuppressive prednisone dose. The baseline group was healthy nontransplant patients. The average immunosuppressive prednisolone dose measurement for all transplant receivers was higher than the baseline group by around 50%. A certain test score was higher in female receivers and receivers taking the immunosuppressive cyclosporin drug. The highest score was in women on estrogen supplements taking the cyclosporin drug. More patients on the three-part therapy had steroid side effects versus those on steroid and the immunosuppressive azathioprine drug (17/27 versus 4/15). More women than men had side effects (14/16 versus 7/22). The immunosuppressive prednisone drug score was higher in those with side effects than without. CsA drug increases the usuable amount of immunosuppressive prednisolone drug. The increased exposure to steroid increased steroid side effect severity in a majority of patients. Since the major contributor to test scores was maximum post-dose concentration, single-point monitoring (monitoring 2 hours post-dose) may be used for routine studies."

This review addresses the evidence and knowledge gaps on whether a beneficial effect of metformin in lupus may be due to a restoration of a balanced redox state. Recent Advances: Clinical trials in SLE patients with mild to moderate disease activity and preclinical studies in mice have provided encouraging results for metformin. The mechanism by which this therapeutic effect was achieved is largely unknown. Metformin regulates redox homeostasis in a context-specific manner. Multiple cell types contribute to SLE, with evidence of increased mitochondrial oxidative stress in T cells and neutrophils. Critical issues: The major knowledge gaps are whether the efficacy of metformin is linked to a restored redox homeostasis in the immune system, and if it does, in which cell types it occurs? We also need to know which patients may have a better response to metformin, and whether it corresponds to a specific mechanism? Finally, the identification of biomarkers to predict treatment outcomes would be of great value.","Metformin, an anti-diabetic medication, may treat full-body or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an inflammatory disease in which immune cells mistakely attack joints, skin, brain cells and more. The primary target of metformin, a specific energy-generator in the cell, is linked with electrical balance in immune cells, which influence the creation of diseases in which immune cells mistakely attack healthy cells. This article reviews the evidence and knowledge gaps on whether metformin's beneficial effects in lupus may be due to a restored, balanced electrical state. Clinical trials in SLE patients with mild to moderate disease severity and mice studies show encouraging results for metformin. How this beneficial effect is achieved is largely unknown. Metformin monitors electrical balance depending on the situation. Multiple cell types contribute to SLE, with evidence of increased cellular stress in certain immune cells called T cells and neutrophils. The major knowledge gaps are whether the success of metformin is linked to a restored electrical balance in the immune system. If it does, in which cell types it occurs? We also need to know which patients may have a better response to metformin, and if it corresponds to a specfic biological process? Finally, identifying markers to predict treatment outcomes would be very useful.","Metformin is a medication that has been proposed as a treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells). Metformin targets certain cells in the immune system that play a critical role in development of autoimmune diseases, which are diseases where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. This review addresses the evidence and knowledge gaps on whether a beneficial effect of metformin in lupus may be due to a restoration of redox homeostasis, a balanced level of reactive oxygen molecules that signal to other cells. Clinical trials in lupus patients with mild to moderate disease activity and studies in mice have provided encouraging results for metformin. The mechanism that creates this therapeutic effect is largely unknown. Metformin regulates redox homeostasis in specific situations. Multiple cell types contribute to lupus. The major knowledge gaps are whether the effectiveness of metformin is linked to a restored redox homeostasis in the immune system, and if it is linked, in which type of cells does it occur. Researchers also need to know which patients may have a better response to metformin, and whether it relates to a specific mechanism or process in the body. Finally, the identification of specific biological factors to predict treatment outcomes would be of great value."
21,33064426,"Groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and comprise inguinal and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias are more common in men. Although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. Ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g., groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. Herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients. Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.","Digestive organs (e.g., intestines) coming out through a weak point or tear in the abdomen causes groin hernias and includes inguinal (groin area) and femoral (upper thigh area) hernias. Inguinal hernias happen more in men. Although groin hernias are easily seen in a physical exam in men, ultrasound is often needed in women. Ultrasound is also helpful when a doctor thinks a hernia has returned, there is a complication after surgery to repair the hernia, or there is another cause of pain (e.g., groin mass, fluid collection in the scrotum). MRI has higher accuracy for detection and no detection than ultrasound and is useful for diagnosing hidden hernias if a doctor thinks it is hernia even if an ultrasound does not show one. Injecting a substance into the hernia sac to improve visibility in x-rays may be used in some patients. Learning about the common types of surgeries can help family doctors improve care after surgery and look for complications, including the hernia returning. Minimally invasive repair has a shorter recovery time, earlier return to daily activities, less pain, and lower return rates than traditional repair. Men with inguinal hernias and with few to no symptoms can reasonably and safely watch the hernia without treatment unless symptoms appear or change. Watching without treatment unless symptoms appear or change is not suggested in people with hernias with symptoms or in nonpregnant women.",
7,7864482,"Most patients who seek medical attention for sore throat are concerned about streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, but fewer than 10% of adults and 30% of children actually have a streptococcal infection. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) are most often responsible for bacterial tonsillopharyngitis, although Neisseria gonorrhea, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum (formerly Corynebacterium haemolyticum), Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR agent), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have also been suggested as possible, infrequent, sporadic pathogens. Viruses or idiopathic causes account for the remainder of sore throat complaints. Reliance on clinical impression to diagnose GAS tonsillopharyngitis is problematic; an overestimation of 80% to 95% by experienced clinicians typically occurs for adult patients. Overtreatment promotes bacterial resistance, disturbs natural microbial ecology, and may produce unnecessary side effects. Existing data suggest that rapid GAS antigen testing as an aid to clinical diagnosis can be very useful. When used appropriately, it is sensitive (79% to 88%) in detecting GAS-infected patients and is specific (90% to 96%) and cost-effective. Penicillin has been the treatment of choice for GAS tonsillopharyngitis since the 1950s; 10 days of treatment are necessary for bacterial eradication. A single IM injection of benzathine penicillin is effective and obviates compliance issues. Until the early 1970s, the bacteriologic failure rate for the treatment of GAS tonsillopharyngitis ranged from 2% to 10% and was attributed to chronic GAS carriers. Since the late 1970s, the penicillin failure rate has frequently exceeded 20% in published reports. Explanations for recurrent GAS tonsillopharyngitis include poor patient compliance; reacquisition from a family member or peer, copathogenic colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, anaerobes that inactivate penicillin with beta-lactamase, or all these organisms; suppression of natural immune response by too-early administration of antibiotics; GAS tolerance to penicillin; antibiotic eradication of normal pharyngeal flora that normally act as natural host defenses; and establishment of a true carrier state. When therapy fails, milder symptoms may occur during the relapse. Several antimicrobials have demonstrated superior efficacy compared with penicillin in eradicating GAS and are administered less frequently to enhance patient compliance. In previously untreated GAS throat infections, cephalosporins produce a 5% to 22% higher bacteriologic cure rate; after a penicillin treatment failure, these differences are greater. Amoxicillin/clavulanate and the extended-spectrum macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin may also produce enhanced bacteriologic eradication in comparison to penicillin.","Most people who go to a doctor for sore throat are worried they have a strep throat and tonsil infection, but fewer than 10% of adults and 30% of children actually have a strep infection. Group A strep bacteria are the most common cause of bacterial strep throat and tonsil infection, but other bacteria known to cause sexually-transmitted gonorrhea or chlamydia, or head, neck, and lung infections occasionally might cause it. Remaining sore throat issues are caused by viruses and unknown causes. Relying on a doctor's exam to diagnose group A strep throat and tonsil infection causes problems. Experienced doctors over-diagnose 80 to 95% of adult cases. Doctors treating someone more than needed leads to the ability of bacteria to defeat the antibiotics designed to kill them, affects small organisms that live in or on the human body, and may cause side effects that are not needed. Studies show combining a rapid strep testing (using a throat swab to detect bacterial fragments) with a doctor exam can be helpful for diagnosis. When used correctly, a rapid strep test has high accuracy for group A strep throat and tonsil infection detection and does not cost a lot. Penicillin has been the preferred treatment for group A strep throat and tonsil infection since the 1950s. Taking penicillin for 10 days is needed to kill all the group A bacteria. One benzathine penicillin shot works and does not require people following doctor instructions. Until the early 1970s, the rate of group A strep bacteria coming back after treatment was low and thought to be caused by people who had long-term Group A bacteria in their bodies. Since the late 1970s, the rate of group A strep bacteria coming back after treatment more than doubled according to studies. Reasons for reoccurring group A strep throat and tonsil infection are people not following doctor instructions; getting the infection again from a family member or peer; infection caused by group A strep bacteria and other bacteria; taking antibiotics too early in the infection; group A strep bacteria defeating antibiotics used to kill them; antibiotics killing small organisms in the throat that protect it; and people who have the bacteria in their bodies but are not sick. When treatment doesn't work, milder symptoms may happen as symptoms return. Many substances that kill small organisms have worked better than penicillin to kill group A strep bacteria and are given less often to increase the rate at which people follow doctor orders. In group A strep and tonsil infection that is not treated, cephalosporins, another type of antibiotic, kill all group A strep bacteria more often than penicillin. After penicillin is taken and does not cure group A strep throat and tonsil infection, this rate is higher. A combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate, other antibiotics, and clarithromycin and azithromycin, another kind of antibiotics called macrolides that kill more types of bacteria, may also kill more bacteria than penicillin.",
27,34383735,"In December 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, and in February 2021, FDA issued an EUA for the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine. After each EUA, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for vaccine use; currently Pfizer-BioNTech is authorized and recommended for persons aged ≥12 years and Moderna and Janssen for persons aged ≥18 years (1-3). Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, administered as 2-dose series, are mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, whereas the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, administered as a single dose, is a recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus-vector vaccine. As of July 22, 2021, 187 million persons in the United States had received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine (4); close monitoring of safety surveillance has demonstrated that serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are rare (5,6). Three medical conditions have been reported in temporal association with receipt of COVID-19 vaccines. Two of these (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome [TTS], a rare syndrome characterized by venous or arterial thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, and Guillain-Barré syndrome [GBS], a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder characterized by ascending weakness and paralysis) have been reported after Janssen COVID-19 vaccination. One (myocarditis, cardiac inflammation) has been reported after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination, particularly after the second dose; these were reviewed together and will hereafter be referred to as mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. ACIP has met three times to review the data associated with these reports of serious adverse events and has comprehensively assessed the benefits and risks associated with receipt of these vaccines. During the most recent meeting in July 2021, ACIP determined that, overall, the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality outweigh the risks for these rare serious adverse events in adults aged ≥18 years; this balance of benefits and risks varied by age and sex. ACIP continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination in all persons aged ≥12 years. CDC and FDA continue to closely monitor reports of serious adverse events and will present any additional data to ACIP for consideration. Information regarding risks and how they vary by age and sex and type of vaccine should be disseminated to providers, vaccine recipients, and the public.","In December 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations (when unapproved medicines may be used) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines (vaccines for the viral, respiratory disease). In February 2021, the FDA issued an emergency authorization for the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) Covid-19 vaccine. After each emergency authorization was issued, short-term recommendations for vaccine use were issued. Currently, Pfizer is authorized and recommended for persons aged 12 years or older and Moderna and Janssen for persons aged 18 years and older. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two shots and use a strand of genetic code that the body uses to build a protein that’s found in the coronavirus. The Janssen vaccine requires one shot and delivers instructions by DNA that the virus cannot replicate. As of July 22, 2021, 187 million people in the United States received at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine, and it has been demonstrated that serious side effects are rare. Three medical conditions have been reported after getting the Covid-19 vaccine, but the association between these conditions and the vaccine is mainly based on timing, in which the condition and vaccine occur around the same time. Two of these conditions are reported after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. They are 1) thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome [TTS], a rare condition with blood clots in the veins and arteries and low blood platelet counts (platelets help the body form blood clots to stop bleeding from injury), and 2) Guillain-Barré syndrome [GBS], a rare disorder characterized by muscle weakness and paralysis. One condition (myocarditis, cardiac inflammation or heart-related swelling from an infection) has been reported after the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, usually after the second dose. These two vaccines will be referred to as mRNA Covid-19 vaccination.

29,34579048,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with diverse clinical manifestations, immune dysfunction, and gut microbiota alterations. The nutritional and biochemical quality of one's diet can influence the intestinal microbiota, which may play a role in the defense mechanisms against potential pathogens, by promoting a wide variety of immune-host interactions. In the COVID-19 pandemic, besides the development of pharmacological therapies, a healthy balanced diet, rich with food-derived antioxidants, may be a useful strategy. Many studies demonstrated that vitamins and probiotic therapies have positive effects on the treatment and prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation in COVID-19. The ecology of the gut microbiota in the digestive tract has been linked to the transport function of the host receptor known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), suggesting that COVID-19 may be related to the gut microbiota. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and its receptor (ACE2), play central roles in modulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In addition, ACE2 has functions that act independently of the RAS. ACE2 is the receptor for the SARS coronavirus, and ACE2 is essential for the expression of neutral amino acid transporters in the gut. In this context, ACE2 modulates innate immunity and influences the composition of the gut microbiota. Malnutrition is one of the leading underlying causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide and, including comorbidities, may be a major cause of worse outcomes and higher mortality among COVID-19 patients. This paper reviews the research on dietary components, with particular emphasis on vitamins, antioxidants, and probiotic therapies, and their impacts on the intestinal microbiota's diversity during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Coronavirus infection (a viral, respiratory disease) is associated with different types of symptoms, as well as damage to the immune system and changes in gut microbiota, which are important microorganisms in the digestive system that process food and help the body use nutrients. The nutrition and chemical processes of one's diet can alter the microbiota in the stomach, which may play a role in the body's ability to fight possible infections. In the Covid-19 pandemic, besides developing medicines and vaccines, a healthy diet with antioxidants (vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells) may be a useful option. Many studies show that vitamins and probiotic (good bacteria) therapies have positive effects on the treatment and prevention of oxidative stress (a condition that happens when antioxidant levels are low leading to cell and tissue damage) and inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) in Covid-19. Research on the relationship between the gut microbiota in the digestive system and its environment is linked to the protein receptor of the cell surface that allows the virus to enter, called ACE2, suggesting that Covid-19 may be linked to the gut microbiota. The protein and its ACE2 receptor that allows viruses to attach to cells play central roles in controlling the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is the system that regulates blood pressure and fluids in the body. In addition, ACE2 has functions that act without influence by the RAS. ACE2 is the receptor for the SARS coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and ACE2 is essential for the production of amino acids (molecules that form proteins) in the gut. In this instance, ACE2 controls natural immunity or infection prevention and influences what substances make up the gut microbiota. Malnutrition is one of the leading underlying causes of illness and death across the world and, including other health problems, may be a major cause of worse outcomes and higher deaths among Covid-19 patients.

16,2199128,"The growth of knowledge in the field of the pharmacokinetics of prednisolone/prednisone has been slow for several reasons. First, convenient and specific methods for measuring these steroids only became available with the development of high performance liquid chromatographic methods. Secondly, prednisolone is nonlinearly bound to transcortin and albumin: since the unbound concentrations of prednisolone are biologically relevant, it was necessary to determine the free fraction in each plasma sample. Thirdly, due to the short half-life of prednisolone no steady-state is achieved, and therefore area under the concentration-time curve needed to be determined in all studies. Fourthly, prednisolone and prednisone are interconvertible and prednisolone is given intravenously as an ester prodrug, features which created controversies about the correct interpretation of pharmacokinetic results. Finally, the total body clearances of total and (to a lesser degree) of unbound prednisolone increase with increasing concentrations of prednisolone. Therefore, in order to compare pharmacokinetic results between different subjects, standardised doses had to be administered. The investigations performed so far have revealed that: (1) the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics partly explain the clinical observation that an alternate-day regimen with prednisone yields fewer biological effects; (2) the interconversion of prednisone into prednisolone is not a limiting factor, even in patients with severely impaired liver function; (3) hypoproteinaemia per se does not cause increased unbound concentrations of prednisolone in vivo; (4) patients with liver failure, renal failure or a renal transplant, subjects older than 65 years, women on estrogen-containing oral contraceptive steroids or subjects taking ketoconazole have increased unbound concentrations of prednisolone-whereas hyperthyroid patients, some patients with Crohn's disease, subjects taking microsomal liver enzyme-inducing agents or patients on intravenous prednisolone phthalate (instead of prednisolone phosphate) or on some brands of enteric coated prednisolone tablets have decreased concentrations of prednisolone. The biological relevance of the altered pharmacokinetics is supported in part by altered clinical effects and altered effects on cellular immunofunctions.","The growth of knowledge in the activity of prednisolone/prednisone (a steroid hormone with immunosuppressant effects) has been slow for many reasons. First, convenient and specific methods to measure these steroids only became available with the creation of advanced lab techniques. Secondly, prednisolone is connected to certain liver proteins. Since the unconnected amounts of prednisolone are important, it was necessary to measure the unconnected amount in each blood sample. Thirdly, due to the short span of prednisolone, no balance is achieved. Thus, specific measurements needed to always be measured. Fourthly, prednisolone and prednisone are interchangeable and prednisolone is given into the blood in an inactive form, attributes which created issues about correct interpretation of the lab results. Finally, the full-body removal of total and unconnected prednisolone increase with increasing amounts of prednisolone. Therefore, to compare lab results between different patients, measured doses had to be given. The tests performed have shown that (1) the dose-dependent drug reactions partly explain observations that an every-other-day schedule with prednisone leads to less biological effects. (2) The change of prednisone into prednisolone is not limiting, even in patients with very damaged liver function. (3) Subnormal protein levels do not cause increased amounts of unbound prednisolone in living beings. (4) Patients with liver failure, kidney failure or a kideny transplant, subjects older than 65 years, women on estrogen-containing, pregnancy-preventing, oral steroids or subjects taking ketoconazole (an antifungal medication) have increased amounts of unbound prednisolone. However, patients with overactive thyroids, some patients with Crohn's disease (an inflammatory bowel disease), subjects taking specific liver medication, or patients on a specific prednisolone given into the blood (instead of another form of prednisolone) or on some brands of intenstinally-related prednisolone tablets have decreased amounts of prednisolone. The importance of these changed drug reactions is supported partly by changed clinical effects and changed effects on cellular immunofunctions.","The growth of knowledge in the field of pharmacokinetics (how the body handles a drug) of prednisolone/prednisone (two types of steroid drugs) has been slow for several reasons. First, the most convenient and specific way to measure these steroid drugs only became possible with the development of high performance liquid chromatographic methods, a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze. Secondly, it is necessary to understand the free fraction, or portion of the drug that has an effect on the body, of prednisolone in each plasma (the liquid portion of blood) sample. Third, due to the short half-life (how long it takes for a drug concentration to be reduced to exactly half its initial amount in the blood) of prednisolone, there is no steady state (when how much the body is given of prednisolone is equal to how much of the drug the body eliminates). Therefore, the area under the concentration-time curve (a measure of total exposure to the drug in the body's systems) is needed. Fourth, prednisolone and prednisone can be exchanged for one another or converted to the other, and prednisolone is given intravenously or via injection. These features create disagreement about the correct way to understand how the body is able to handle these drugs. Finally, the total amount of prednisolone that is cleared from the body and the total amount of prednisolone that has an effect on the body increase with more concentration of prednisolone. Therefore, in order to compare pharmacokinetic results (how the body responds to or handles a drug) between different people, the same dose has to be given to patients. The investigations done so far reveal that: 1) using the amount of dose to understand the body's effect explains why an alternate- or every-other-day treatment with prednisone leads to fewer effects in the body; 2) it is not a limiting factor that prednisone can convert to prednisolone; 3) hypoproteinaemia (lower than normal levels of protein in the body) does not cause an increase of the amount of drug in the body that can have an effect; 4) patients with liver failure, kidney failure, or kidney transplant, as well as people with other conditions, have an increased amount of the prednisolone drugs - while patients with other conditions such as Crohn's disease have decreased amounts of prednisolone. The biological importance of the changes in how the body handles these steroids is supported, in part, by changes at the clinical and immune cell level."
18,9540949,"Objective: To determine the effect of carbohydrate restriction on perinatal outcome in patients with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: Women with diet-controlled GDM were divided non-randomly into two groups based on their dietary carbohydrate content: those with low dietary carbohydrate content (below 42%) and those with high dietary carbohydrate content (exceeding 45%). Subjects kept dietary accounts and were followed with daily fasting and postprandial glucose assessments. Subjects also were tested daily for urinary ketones. Glycosylated hemoglobin, mean fasting and postprandial glucose values, incidence of macrosomia and large for gestational age (LGA) infants, cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia, and need for insulin therapy were compared between the groups. Results: The two groups were identical in terms of demographic characteristics. Significant reductions in the postprandial glucose values were seen among subjects in the low-carbohydrate group (P < .04). Fewer subjects in the low-carbohydrate group required the addition of insulin for glucose control (P < .047; relative risk [RR] 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02, 1.00). The incidence of LGA infants was significantly lower in the low-carbohydrate group (P < .035; RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.05, 0.91). Subjects in the low carbohydrate group also had a lower rate of cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia (P < .037; RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.04, 0.94). Conclusion: Carbohydrate restriction in patients with diet-controlled GDM results in improved glycemic control, less need for insulin therapy, a decrease in the incidence LGA infants, and a decrease in cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia.","The objective is to determine how carb restriction affects births in diet-controlled gestational diabetics, in which high blood sugar affects pregnant women. Diet-controlled, pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar were divided non-randomly based on dietary carb intake: a low-carb intake group (below 42%) or high-carb intake group (over 45%). Subjects kept diet records and were followed with daily blood sugar measurements. Subjects also were tested daily for ketones in urine. Certain blood sugar and birth-related measurements were compared between groups. The two groups had identical socioeconomic traits. The low-carb group had reduced after-meal glucose levels. Less patients in the low-carb group needed insulin for glucose control. The frequency of large-for-prebirth-age infants was lower in the low-carb group. The low-carb group also had less cesarean deliveries for large-head babies and large-body babies. Carb restriction in diet-controlled, pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar improves blood sugar control, reduces need for insulin, reduces frequency of large-for-prebirth-age infants, and reduces cesarean deliveries for large-head and large-body babies.","The objective of this study is to determine the effect of limiting carbohydrates (carbs) on perinatal (time before and after birth) outcomes in patients with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus (diagnosed with diabetes for the first time during pregnancy). Women with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus are divided non-randomly into two groups based on the amount of carbs in their diet: those with low carbs in the diet (below 42%) and those with high carbs in the diet (exceeding 45%). Patients keep food diaries and are followed with assessments of daily fasting (no food) and blood sugar levels after meals. Patients also were tested daily for urinary ketones (chemicals in uring made from the liver that indicate the body is using fat for fuel instead of sugar). Glycosylated hemoglobin (a blood test that measures the percent of a protein found in blood red cells), average fasting and after meals blood sugar numbers, number of macrosomia (a newborn who is much larger than average) and large for gestational age infants (newborns who weighs more than 90% of other newborns of the same gestational age at birth), cesarean deliveries (C-section) for cephalopelvic disproportion (when a baby's head is too large to fit through the mother's pelvis) and macrosomia, and need for insulin therapy (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood) are compared between the groups. The two groups are identical in terms of demographic characteristics such as age, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and income. Major decreases in the after meal blood sugar numbers are seen among patients in the low-carb group. Fewer patients in the low-carb group needed the additional insulin to control blood sugar. The number of large for gestational age infants was much lower in the low-carb group. Patients in the low-carb group also have lower rates of cesarean deliveries due to cephalopelvic disproportion (in which the baby's head is too large to fit through the mother's pelvis) and macrosomia (in which the newborn who is much larger than average). In conclusion, limiting carbohydrates in patients with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus results in improved blood sugar control, less need for insulin therapy, a decrease in the number of large for gestational age infants, and a decrease in cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia."
34,28434208,"Background: Dietary changes are routinely recommended in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on the basis of randomised evidence in the general population and non-randomised studies in CKD that suggest certain healthy eating patterns may prevent cardiovascular events and lower mortality. People who have kidney disease have prioritised dietary modifications as an important treatment uncertainty. Objectives: This review evaluated the benefits and harms of dietary interventions among adults with CKD including people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation. Main results: We included 17 studies involving 1639 people with CKD. Three studies enrolled 341 people treated with dialysis, four studies enrolled 168 kidney transplant recipients, and 10 studies enrolled 1130 people with CKD stages 1 to 5. Eleven studies (900 people) evaluated dietary counselling with or without lifestyle advice and six evaluated dietary patterns (739 people), including one study (191 people) of a carbohydrate-restricted low-iron, polyphenol enriched diet, two studies (181 people) of increased fruit and vegetable intake, two studies (355 people) of a Mediterranean diet and one study (12 people) of a high protein/low carbohydrate diet. Risks of bias in the included studies were generally high or unclear, lowering confidence in the results. Participants were followed up for a median of 12 months (range 1 to 46.8 months). Studies were not designed to examine all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events. In very-low quality evidence, dietary interventions had uncertain effects on all-cause mortality or ESKD. In absolute terms, dietary interventions may prevent one person in every 3000 treated for one year avoiding ESKD, although the certainty in this effect was very low. Across all 17 studies, outcome data for cardiovascular events were sparse. Dietary interventions in low quality evidence were associated with a higher health-related quality of life (2 studies, 119 people: MD in SF-36 score 11.46, 95% CI 7.73 to 15.18; I2 = 0%). Adverse events were generally not reported. Dietary interventions lowered systolic blood pressure (3 studies, 167 people: MD -9.26 mm Hg, 95% CI -13.48 to -5.04; I2 = 80%) and diastolic blood pressure (2 studies, 95 people: MD -8.95, 95% CI -10.69 to -7.21; I2 = 0%) compared to a control diet. Dietary interventions were associated with a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (5 studies, 219 people: SMD 1.08; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.97; I2 = 88%) and serum albumin levels (6 studies, 541 people: MD 0.16 g/dL, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.24; I2 = 26%). A Mediterranean diet lowered serum LDL cholesterol levels (1 study, 40 people: MD -1.00 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.56 to -0.44). Authors' conclusions: Dietary interventions have uncertain effects on mortality, cardiovascular events and ESKD among people with CKD as these outcomes were rarely measured or reported. Dietary interventions may increase health-related quality of life, eGFR, and serum albumin, and lower blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels. Based on stakeholder prioritisation of dietary research in the setting of CKD and preliminary evidence of beneficial effects on risks factors for clinical outcomes, large-scale pragmatic RCTs to test the effects of dietary interventions on patient outcomes are required.","Changes in diet are often recommended for people with chronic kidney disease on the basis of evidence in the general population and in other studies of chronic kidney disease. People who have kidney disease have prioritized changes in their diet as uncertain treatment. This review evaluates the benefits and harms of dietary interventions (changing diet and diet behavior to reach a health goal) among adults with chronic kidney disease, including people with end-stage kidney disease treated with dialysis (a process that uses a machine to clean the blood because the kidneys are not working) or kidney transplantation or donation. Researchers include 17 studies involving 1639 people with chronic kidney disease. Three studies include 341 people treated with dialysis, four studies have 168 kidney transplant recipients, and 10 studies have 1130 people with chronic kidney disease at stages ranging from 1 to 5. Among these studies, 11 evaluated dietary counselling with or without lifestyle advice, and 6 evaluated dietary patterns, including 1 study of a low-carb/low-iron with many plant-based foods diet, 2 studies of increased fruit and vegetable intake, 2 studies of a Mediterranean diet and 1 study of a high protein/low carb diet. Risks of bias in these studies are generally high or unclear, lowering confidence in how true the results are in these papers. Participants are followed up for about 12 months, but the time ranges between 1 to 46.8 months. Studies are not designed to examine all causes of illness or heart disease events. In very low quality evidence, dietary interventions or treatment have uncertain effects on deaths from any cause or end-stage kidney disease. Dietary interventions to treat kidney disease may prevent one person in every 3000 treated for one year to avoid end-stage kidney disease, although the certainty that this result will happen is very low. Across all 17 studies, outcome data for heart events are limited. Dietary interventions in low quality evidence studies are associated with a higher health-related quality of life. Adverse (unexpected and negative) events are generally not reported. In some studies, dietary interventions lowered systolic blood pressure (top blood pressure number) and diastolic blood pressure (bottom blood pressure number) compared to a control diet. Dietary interventions are associated with a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a blood test that measures removal of creatinine levels which are waste products from digestion and muscle breakdown. They are also linked to higher albumin (liver proteins that keep fluid in the bloodstream) levels in the blood. A Mediterranean diet lowered LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. In conclusion, dietary interventions have uncertain effects on death, heart events, and end-stage kidney disease among people with chronic kidney disease because these effects are rarely measured or described. Dietary interventions may increase health-related quality of life, eGFR, and albumin levels in the blood, and lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Large-scale clinical studies to test the effects of dietary interventions on patient outcomes are needed.","Diet changes are usually recommended in people with long-lasting or chronic kidney disease (CKD) since studies suggest certain healthy eating patterns may prevent heart-related events and lower deaths. People with kidney disease have important diet changes as a treatment uncertainty. This review explored the pros and cons of dietary treatment in adults with CKD including those with kidney failure treated with an artificial kidney machine or kidney transplant. We included 17 studies with 1639 people with CKD. Three studies used 341 people treated with an artifical kidney disease. Four studies had 168 kidney transplant receivers. 10 studies had 1130 people with low to severe CKD. Eleven studies (900 people) evaluated diet counselling with or without lifestyle advice. Six evaluated diet patterns (739 people), including one study (191 people) of a carb-restricted low-iron, high plant-nutrient diet, two studies (181 people) of increased fruit and vegetable intake, two studies (355 people) of a Mediterranean diet and one study (12 people) of a high protein/low carb diet. Risk of bias in the studies were generally high or unclear, casting doubts in the results. Participants were checked for an average of 12 months. Studies were not made to examine all-cause death or heart-related events. In very-low quality results, diet interventions had uncertain effects on all-cause deaths or kidney failure. In established results, diet treatments may prevent kidney failure in one in every 3000 people, although the certainty of this effect was very low. Across all 17 studies, outcome data for heart-related evens was rare. Diet treatments in low quality evidence was linked with a higher heart-related quality of life. Side effects were generally not reported. Diet treatments lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to a control or regular diet. Diet treatments were linked with a higher kidney filtration rate and blood levels of albumin, a blood protein. A Mediterranean diet lowered ""unwanted"" blood cholesterol levels. Diet treatments have uncertain effects on death, heart-related events, and kidney failure among people with CKD since these outcomes were rarely measured or reported. Diet treatment may increased health-related quality of life, kidney filtration rate, and blood albumin. Diet treatment may lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. Based on the importance of diet research for CKD and initial evidence of beneficial effects on health, large-scale studies to test the effects of diet treatments on patient outcomes are needed."

13,18760136,"Background: Dronedarone is a new multichannel blocker for atrial fibrillation (AF) previously demonstrated to have both rhythm and rate control properties in paroxysmal and persistent AF. The Efficacy and safety of dRonedArone for The cOntrol of ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation (ERATO) trial assessed the efficacy of dronedarone in the control of ventricular rate in patients with permanent AF, when added to standard therapy. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, multinational trial, dronedarone, 400 mg twice a day (n = 85), or matching placebo (n = 89) was administered for 6 months to adult patients with permanent AF, in addition to standard therapy. The primary end point was the change in mean ventricular rate between baseline and day 14, as assessed by 24-hour Holter. Ventricular rate was also assessed during submaximal and maximal exercise. Results: Dronedarone significantly decreased mean 24-hour ventricular rate. Compared with placebo, the mean treatment effect at day 14 was a reduction of 11.7 beats per minute (beat/min; P < .0001). Comparable reductions were sustained throughout the 6-month trial. During maximal exercise and compared to placebo, there was a mean reduction of 24.5 beat/min (P < .0001), without any reduction in exercise tolerance as measured by maximal exercise duration. The effects of dronedarone were additive to those of other rate-control agents, including beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and digoxin. Dronedarone was well tolerated, with no organ toxicities or proarrhythmia. Conclusion: In addition to its reported rhythm-targeting and rate-targeting therapeutic actions in paroxysmal and persistent AF, dronedarone improves ventricular rate control in patients with permanent AF. Dronedarone was well tolerated with no evidence of organ toxicities or proarrhythmias in this short-term study.","Dronedarone is a new drug that can treat atrial fibrillation (a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots or stroke) or AF and is found to help control the heart rhythm and heart rate in patients with paroxysmal (when the heart rate returns to normal within 7 days on its own or with treatment) or with persistent (greater than 7 days) atrial fibrillation. A clinical trial called the Efficacy and safety of dRonedArone for The cOntrol of ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation (ERATO) reviewed how well dronedarone worked to control the ventricular rate (heart rate) in patients with permanent AF, when added to other treatments. In this clinical trial of patients with permanent AF, 85 patients receive the dronedarone drug, and 85 receive a placebo (an inactive substance that looks like the treatment drug) for 6 months. A key measure is the average change in ventricular rate between the start of the trial and day 14 of the trial. Ventricular rate is also evaluated during submaximal exercise (any physical activity with increased intensity in which heart rate does not go above 85) and maximal exercise (physical activity increased to come close to fatigue). Dronedarone significantly decreased the average 24-hour ventricular rate. When compared to the placebo group, the average effect of dronedarone on day 14 was a reduction of 11.7 beats per minute. Similar reductions continued throughout the 6-month trial. There was a reduction in heart beats per minute during maximal exercise when compared to the placebo group. The effects of dronedarone were an addition to the effects of other drugs that control heart rate. Dronedarone was well tolerated with few side effects. In addition to its previously demonstrated effects on heart rhythm and rate in short-term and long-term AF, dronedarone improves ventricular rate control in patients with permanent AF. Dronedarone was well tolerated with no evidence of damage to organs or worsening of heart condition in this short-term study.",
32,32278343,"Background: Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) is a risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The C677T 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism increases homocysteine (HCY) levels. This study analyzed the relationship between C677T MTHFR polymorphism and the therapeutic effect of lowering HCY in stroke patients with HHCY. Methods: Baseline data were collected from stroke patients with HHCY for this prospective cohort study. The C677T MTHFR genotype was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and the therapeutic effect to reduce HCY was compared. Results: Of 200 stroke patients 162 (81.0%) completed follow-up and were evaluated. Most of them responded well to treatment (103 cases, 63.5%), but 59 (36.4%) patients were in the poor efficacy group. There was a significant difference in terms of age (P < 0.001), hypertension (P = 0.041), hyperuricemia (P = 0.042), HCY after treatment (P < 0.001), and MTHFR genotype (P < 0.001) between the poor efficacy and effective groups, with increased frequency of the TT genotype in the poor efficacy group. Logistic regression showed that the T allele was associated with poor efficacy (OR = 0.733, 95%CI: 0.693, 0.862, P < 0.001). In the codominant model the TT genotype was associated with poor outcome (OR = 0.862, 95%CI: 0.767, 0.970, P = 0.017) and this was also the case in the recessive model (OR = 0.585, 95%CI: 0.462, 0.741, P < 0.001) but there was no association between CT and TT in the dominant model. Conclusions: The T allele and TT genotype of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with poor HCY reduction treatment efficacy in stroke patients with HHCY.","Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY), when there is excess homocysteine in the blood, is a risk factor for cardiovascular, or blood- and heart-related, and cerebrovascular, or blood- and brain-related, diseases. Homocysteine is an intermediate amino acid (molecule that form proteins). A specific genetic variation or gene change, known as C677T 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism, which alters the MTHFR protein involved in blood pressure, increases homocysteine (HCY) levels. This study analyzed the relationship between C677T MTHFR variation and the therapeutic, beneficial effect (response after a treatment) of lowering HCY in stroke patients with HHCY. Baseline data, meaning prior to treatment, was collected from stroke patients with HHCY for this study. The C677T MTHFR genotype was detected, and the therapeutic effect to reduce HCY was compared. Of 200 stroke patients, 162 completed follow-up and were evaluated. Most of them responded well to treatment, but 59 patients were in the poor efficacy or poor effect group. There was a significant difference in terms of age, hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperuricemia (high uric acid or waste), HCY after treatment, and MTHFR genotype between the poor efficacy and effective groups. The poor efficacy group had more participated with TT genotype of the genetic variant. Statistical analysis showed that the T allele (an alternative form of a gene) was associated with poor efficacy. The TT genotype was associated with poor outcomes. The study concluded the T allele and TT genotype of the MTHFR C677T genetic variation was associated with poor HCY reduction treatment efficacy in stroke patients with HHCY.",
46,31401006,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by the loss of function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein which primarily acts as a chloride channel. CFTR has mainly been studied in epithelial cells although it is also functional and expressed in other cell types including endothelial cells. The present review summarizes current knowledge on the role of the endothelium in CF. More specifically, this review highlights the role of endothelial cells in CF in acting as a semipermeable barrier, as a key regulator of angiogenesis, coagulation, the vascular tone and the inflammatory responses. It could contribute to different aspects of the disease including cardiovascular symptoms, excessive blood vessel formation, pulmonary and portal hypertension and CF-related diabetes.

This review article summarizes current knowledge on the role of the endothelium in CF. More specifically, this review highlights how endothelial cells in CF act as a barrier which regulates blood vessel creation, blood clotting, vessel activity, and inflammation. It could contribute to different aspects of the disease like heart-related symptoms, excessive blood vessel formation, lung and vein-related high blood pressure and CF-related diabetes.

This review summarizes what is known on the role of endothelium in CF. We summarize the role of endothelial cells in CF in acting as a barrier that allows only some things to pass through, partly controlling formation of new blood vessels, clotting, blood vessel constriction, and inflammation. Endothelial cells could play a role in different parts of the disease including heart symptoms, formation of too many blood vessels, two kinds of high blood pressure and CF-related diabetes. Vascular endothelium (the inner cellular lining of arteries, veins, and capillaries) is important to many processes in the body, but it has not been studied enough in CF."
35,26086766,"Background: To develop an OSTAi tool and compare this with the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommendations in 2013 (NOF 2013) for bone mineral density (BMD) testing among Taiwan postmenopausal women. Methods: Taiwan Osteoporosis Association (TOA) conducted a nationwide BMD survey by a bus installed with a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) between 2008 and 2011. All of the participants completed questionnaire, which included demographics and risk factors of osteoporotic fracture in FRAX tool. We used the database to analyze potential risk factors for osteoporosis and followed the model by Koh et al. to develop a risk index via multiple variable regression analysis and item reduction. We used the index values to set up a simple algorithm (namely OSTAi) to identify those who need BMD measurement. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare the sensitivity/specificity analysis of this model with that of recommendations by NOF 2013. Results: A total of 12,175 Taiwan postmenopausal women enrolled in this survey. The index value was derived by age and body weight of the participants according to weighted odds of each risk factor and the selected cutoff value was set at ""-1"". There are 6393 (52.5%) participants whose index value is below ""-1"" and whose risk of osteoporosis was 57.5% (3674/6393). The AUC for OSTAi and NOF 2013 were 0.739 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.728-0.749, P<0.001) and 0.618 (95% CI, 0.606-0.630, P<0.001), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of OSTAi, at the selected cutoff value of -1, and NOF 2013 to identify osteoporosis were 73.1%, 62.0% and 78.3%, 45.7%, respectively. Conclusions: As OSTA for Asian populations, OSTAi is an useful tool to identify Taiwan postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, In comparison with NOF 2013, OSTAi may be an easier and better tool for referral to BMD measurement by DXA in this area.","The study aims to create an osteoporosis (or bone weakening) self assessment (OSTAi) tool and compare it with the National Osteoporosis Foundation 2013 recommendations (NOF 2013) or bone mineral density (BMD) or hardness testing among Taiwan postmenopausal women who completed their final menstrual or sexual cycle. Taiwan Osteoporosis Associated (TOA) had a nationwide BMD survey by a bus installed with an X-ray machine between 2008 and 2011. All participants completed a questionnaire, which had socioeconomic and risk factors of osteoporotic fracture in fracture risk tool.  12,175 Taiwan postmenopausal women participated in this survey. There are 6393 (52.5%) participants below the cutoff and whose risk of osteoporosis was 57.5% (3647/6393). The measurements for OSTAi and NOF were noteworthy. The sensitivity (accuracy of detecting people with the disease) and specificity (accuracy of detecting people without the disease) of OSTAi at the cutoff and NOF 2013 to detect osteoporosis were 73.1%, 62.0% and 78.3%, 45.7%, respectively. Known as OSTA for Asian populations, OSTAi is useful to identify Taiwan postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

We tested women nationwide using a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; a common text to measure bone density) between 2008 and 2011. All women filled out a questionnaire, which included individual information and risk factors of bone breaks caused by osteoporosis. We used this information to look at possible risk factors for osteoporosis. We set up OSTAi to find those who needed BMD measurement. We compared accuracy for disease detection and no detection between OSTAi and the 2013 guidelines. We studied 12,175 Taiwan women who had gone through menopause. There are 6393 (52.5%) participants whose risk of osteoporosis was 57.5% (3674/6393). OSTAi showed slightly lower accuracy for disease detection and higher accuracy for no detection than 2013 guidelines. OSTAi is useful to find Taiwan women who have gone through menopause with osteoporosis. Compared to current guidelines, OSTAi may be an easier and better tool to determine who should have DXA in Taiwan."

In 1957, complete heart block was treated using electrodes directly attached to the heart. These early observations instilled the idea that cardiac electrical failure can be controlled. It ultimately led to the development of totally implantable pacemaker by Chardack, Gage, and Greatbatch. Since then, there have been several advancements in the pacemakers, and the modern-day permanent pacemaker is subcutaneously placed device.

20,7852252,"Background: Although several studies have examined the long-term efficacy of antidepressants, relatively little attention has been paid to the management of relapses or recurrences during continued antidepressant treatment. This study examined whether depressed patients who had recovered and then relapsed on fluoxetine 20 mg/day would benefit from an increase in fluoxetine dose. Method: Eighteen patients who relapsed on fluoxetine 20 mg/day during long-term treatment with fluoxetine as part of a placebo-controlled study had their fluoxetine dose raised to 40 mg/day and were followed for at least 1 month (mean time = 4.7 months). Results: Twelve (67%) were full responders, 3 (17%) partial responders, and 3 (17%) dropped out because of side effects (e.g., insomnia and agitation). Of those patients who had either full or partial response (N = 15; 83%), 3 complete responders had a recurrence on 40 mg/day after a mean of 5.8 months and 1 partial responder had a recurrence 11 months later. Overall, 11 (61%) of 18 patients maintained their response during their follow-up while taking the higher dose of fluoxetine. Conclusion: An increase in dose of fluoxetine to 40 mg/day appears to be an effective strategy in the treatment of relapse among depressed patients who had initially responded to fluoxetine 20 mg/day.","Antidepressants are medications used to treat depression and other disorders and can improve mood, sleep quality, and concentration. Although several studies have examined how well antidepressants work long-term, there is little attention on how to manage relapses (the worsening of a medical condition that had previously improved) or recurrences (when symptoms return months or years after a person has recovered from the last episode) during continued use of antidepressant drugs. This study examined whether depressed patients who had recovered and then relapsed on fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) at 20 mg/day will benefit from an increase dose of fluoxetine. In this study, 18 patients who relapsed on fluoxetine 20 mg/day during long-term treatment with fluoxetine as part of a larger study had their fluoxetine dose raised to 40 mg/day and were followed for at least 1 month. Twelve (67%) were full responders (patients who reached the expected improvement), 3 (17%) partial responders (patients who reached only part of the expected improvement), and 3 (17%) dropped out of the study because of side effects (e.g. insomnia and agitation).

28,34579572,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised concerns about the detrimental effects of antibodies. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is one of the biggest concerns in terms of not only the antibody reaction to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) upon reinfection with the virus but also the reaction to COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we evaluated ADE of infection by using COVID-19 convalescent-phase plasma and BHK cells expressing human Fcγ receptors (FcγRs). We found that FcγRIIA and FcγRIIIA mediated modest ADE of infection against SARS-CoV-2. Although ADE of infection was observed in monocyte-derived macrophages infected with SARS-CoV-2, including its variants, proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression was not upregulated in macrophages. SARS-CoV-2 infection thus produces antibodies that elicit ADE of infection, but these antibodies do not contribute to excess cytokine production by macrophages. IMPORTANCE Viruses infect cells mainly via specific receptors at the cell surface. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is an alternative mechanism of infection for viruses to infect immune cells that is mediated by antibodies and IgG receptors (FcγRs). Because ADE of infection contributes to the pathogenesis of some viruses, such as dengue virus and feline coronavirus, it is important to evaluate the precise mechanism of ADE and its contribution to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using convalescent-phase plasma from COVID-19 patients, we found that two types of FcγRs, FcγRIIA and FcγRIIIA, mediate ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although ADE of infection was observed for SARS-CoV-2 and its recent variants, proinflammatory cytokine production in monocyte-derived macrophages was not upregulated. These observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection produces antibodies that elicit ADE of infection, but these antibodies may not be involved in aberrant cytokine release by macrophages during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory disease, highlights harmful effects of antibodies, body molecules that combat foreign organisms. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is a big concern because of the antibody reaction to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, upon reinfection and the reaction to COVID-19 vaccines. We found that certain cell molecules affect mild ADE of infection against SARS-CoV-2. Although certain immune cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and its variants had infection enhancement, proinflammatory molecules were not increased in these cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection thus creates antibodies that cause ADE of infection, but these antibodies do not lead to increased inflammatory molecule production by certain cells. Viruses infect cells via certain cell parts. ADE of infection or improvement of infection is another method of infection for viruses to infect immune cells influenced by antibodies and certain cellular molecules. Because ADE of infection leads to disease symptoms of some viruses, understanding how ADE works and leads to these symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 is important. Using blood from COVID-19 patients, we found two cellular molecules that influence ADE of SARS-CoV-2 infection. While ADE of infection was seen for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, proinflammatory molecule production in certain immune cells was not increased. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection may create antibodies that cause ADE of infection, but these antibodies may not lead to increased inflammatory production by certain cells during infection.","The pandemic of COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) has raised concerns about the harmful effects antibodies can have. Antibodies are proteins used by the immune system to identify and neutralize viruses. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a unique occurrence in which virus-specific antibodies actually increase entrance of the virus into the host. ADE is a big concern for both people who are exposed to COVID-19 and those who receive the vaccine. In this study, the authors evaluated ADE of infection by using COVID-19 convalescent-phase plasma (a specific of plasma often used to treat infections) and human cells expressing Fcγ receptors (FcγRs), special receptors on infection-fighting cells. The authors found two Fcγ receptors mediated or controlled most ADE of infection against COVID-19. Although ADE of infection was found in macrophages (a white blood cell) infected with COVID-19, and its variants, proteins that increase inflammation were not upregulated or increased. COVID-19 creates antibodies that cause ADE of infection. However, these antibodies do not increase inflammatory or infection-fighting responses by macrophages. Viruses infect cells mainly through specific receptors (pathways) on the cell surface. ADE of infection is an alternative way that viruses can infect immune cells. ADE is mediated by antibodies and FcγRs. Because ADE of infection contributes to the development of some viruses, it is import to better understand the exact way ADE contributes to COVID-19 progression. In this study, using plasma or blood from COVID-19 patients, we found that two types of Fcγ receptors mediate ADE of COVID-19 infection. Although ADE of infection was seen for COVID-19, and its variants, increased inflammatory responses in macrophages was not found. These findings suggest that COVID-19 infection produces antibodies that produce ADE of infection. However, these antibodies may not be involved in pro-inflammatory pathways by macrophages."
44,29262047,"Etiology: Though most commonly thought of in the setting of trauma, there are numerous causes of hemorrhagic shock that span many systems. Blunt or penetrating trauma is the most common cause, followed by upper and lower gastrointestinal sources. Obstetrical, vascular, iatrogenic, and even urological sources have all been described. Bleeding may be either external or internal. A substantial amount of blood loss to the point of hemodynamic compromise may occur in the chest, abdomen, or retroperitoneum. The thigh itself can hold up to 1 L to 2 L of blood. Pathophysiology: Hemorrhagic shock is due to the depletion of intravascular volume through blood loss to the point of being unable to match the tissues demand for oxygen. As a result, mitochondria are no longer able to sustain aerobic metabolism for the production of oxygen and switch to the less efficient anaerobic metabolism to meet the cellular demand for adenosine triphosphate. In the latter process, pyruvate is produced and converted to lactic acid to regenerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to maintain some degree of cellular respiration in the absence of oxygen. The body compensates for volume loss by increasing heart rate and contractility, followed by baroreceptor activation resulting in sympathetic nervous system activation and peripheral vasoconstriction. Typically, there is a slight increase in the diastolic blood pressure with narrowing of the pulse pressure. As diastolic ventricular filling continues to decline and cardiac output decreases, systolic blood pressure drops. Due to sympathetic nervous system activation, blood is diverted away from noncritical organs and tissues to preserve blood supply to vital organs such as the heart and brain. While prolonging heart and brain function, this also leads to other tissues being further deprived of oxygen causing more lactic acid production and worsening acidosis. This worsening acidosis along with hypoxemia, if left uncorrected, eventually causes the loss of peripheral vasoconstriction, worsening hemodynamic compromise, and death. The body’s compensation varies by cardiopulmonary comorbidities, age, and vasoactive medications. Due to these factors, heart rate and blood pressure responses are extremely variable and, therefore, cannot be relied upon as the sole means of diagnosis.","Though most found in trauma cases, there are numerous causes of hemorrhagic (excessive bleeding) shock stemming from various organ systems. Blunt or penetrating trauma (injury) is the most common cause. Additional causes include upper and lower gastrointestinal (stomach) sources. Obstetrical (related to childbirth), vascular (related to blood vessels), iatrogenic (illness caused by medical exams), and even urological (related to the urinary tract) sources have all been described. Bleeding may be either external or internal. A substantial amount of blood loss, to the point of dysregulated (incorrect) blood flow, may occur in the chest, abdomen, or in the retroperitoneum. The retroperitoneum is area in the back of the abdomen not covered by the peritoneum. The thigh can hold up to 1 L to 2 L of blood. Hemorrhagic shock is caused by the blood loss in vessels to the point of being unable to match the tissues demand for oxygen. As a result, mitochondria (cell part responsible for making chemical energy) are unable to sustain metabolisms needed for oxygen production. Mitochondria switch to the less efficient metabolism to meet cell demand. Pyruvate, a chemical product of energy production, is produced and converted to maintain some cellular respiration (energy creation) in the absence of oxygen. The body compensates for volume loss by increasing heart rate and contractions. These alterations are followed by baroreceptor activation, which is the increased activity of receptors to regulate blood pressure. The resulting endpoints are sympathetic nervous system activation (fight-or-flight activation) and constriction of blood vessels. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and pupil size. There is normally a slight increase in the diastolic blood pressure (when the heart is relaxed) with decreased pulse pressure. As the rate in which the heart fills with blood declines and cardiac output decreases, systolic blood pressure (heart is contracting) drops. Due to sympathetic nervous system activation, blood is moved away from noncritical organs and tissues. This is done to preserve blood supply to vital organs like the heart and brain. While prolonging heart and brain function, this blood movement leads to other tissues being deprived of oxygen. This deprivation can cause more lactic acid production and a build up of acid in the blood. This acid build up along with low blood oxygen, if left uncorrected, eventually causes the loss of peripheral vasoconstriction (narrowed blood vessels), decreased blood flow, and death. How the body handles this varies by accompanying heart and lung diseases, age, and blood pressure medications. Due to these factors, heart rate and blood pressure responses are extremely different between patients. Therefore, heart rate and blood pressure cannot be the sole reasons of diagnosis.",
7,33178623,"The most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis is infection by Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), commonly known as strep throat. 5-15% of adults and 15-35% of children in the United States with pharyngitis have a GABHS infection. The symptoms of GABHS overlap with non-GABHS and viral causes of acute pharyngitis, complicating the problem of diagnosis. A careful physical examination and patient history is the starting point for diagnosing GABHS. After a physical examination and patient history is completed, five types of diagnostic methods can be used to ascertain the presence of a GABHS infection: clinical scoring systems, rapid antigen detection tests, throat culture, nucleic acid amplification tests, and machine learning and artificial intelligence. Clinical guidelines developed by professional associations can help medical professionals choose among available techniques to diagnose strep throat. However, guidelines for diagnosing GABHS created by the American and European professional associations vary significantly, and there is substantial evidence that most physicians do not follow any published guidelines. Treatment for GABHS using analgesics, antipyretics, and antibiotics seeks to provide symptom relief, shorten the duration of illness, prevent nonsuppurative and suppurative complications, and decrease the risk of contagion, while minimizing the unnecessary use of antibiotics. There is broad agreement that antibiotics with narrow spectrums of activity are appropriate for treating strep throat. But whether and when patients should be treated with antibiotics for GABHS remains a controversial question. There is no clearly superior management strategy for strep throat, as significant controversy exists regarding the best methods to diagnose GABHS and under what conditions antibiotics should be prescribed.","Strep throat caused by bacteria is most commonly caused by group A strep bacteria. 5-15% of adults and 15-35% children in the United States with strep throat have a group A strep bacteria infection. The symptoms of group A strep bacteria are similar to short-term strep throat caused by viruses and other bacteria, which makes strep throat hard to diagnose. Diagnosing strep throat caused by group A strep bacteria begins with a careful physical exam and patient history. Following a physical exam and patient history, there are five ways to diagnose strep throat caused by group A strep bacteria: scoring systems, rapid antigen tests to find strep bacterial fragments, throat swabs to grow strep bacteria, tests for strep genetic material, and computer predictions. Clinical guidelines written by professional groups can help doctors choose which way to diagnose strep throat. However, guidelines for diagnosing group A strep throat created by professional groups in the United States and Europe differ, and many doctors do not follow any guidelines. Treating group A strep throat with painkillers, fever-reducers, and antibiotics aims to relieve symptoms, shorten illness length, prevent later medical problems with pus or without pus, and decrease the spread, while reducing the use of antibiotics when they are not needed. Experts agree that antibiotics that kill fewer bacteria are best to treat strep throat. Experts do not agree whether and when people with group A strep throat should be given antibiotics. There is no best way to treat strep throat, as experts do not agree on the best way to diagnose group A strep throat and when antibiotics should be given.",
30,33816325,"This study aimed to monitor severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral loads and specific serum-antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig] G and M) among confirmed patients and asymptomatic carriers from returning healthy travelers. The throat swabs, sputum, and stool samples from 57 hospitalized coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers, among 170 returning healthy travelers were tested using reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction. SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies were detected via serum chemiluminescence assay. Sequential results showed higher viral RNA loads in the throat, sputum, and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptom onset among severely ill COVID-19 patients. Shorter viral habitation time (1-8 days) was observed in the oropharyngeal site and intestinal tract of asymptomatic carriers. The IgG and IgM response rates were 19/37 (51.4%) and 23/37 (62.6%) among the 29 confirmed patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers, respectively, within 66 days from symptom or detection onset. The median duration between symptom onset and positive IgG and IgM results was 30 (n=23; interquartile range [IQR]=20-66) and 23 (n=19; IQR=12-28) days, respectively. Of 170 returning healthy-travelers to China, 4.7% were asymptomatic carriers (8/170) within 2 weeks, and the IgG and IgM positivity rate was 12.8% (12/94). IgM/IgG-positivity confirmed 3 suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, despite negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Compared with other respiratory viral infectious diseases, COVID-19 has fewer asymptomatic carriers, lower antibody response rates, and a longer antibody production duration in recovered patients and the contacted healthy population. This is an indication of the complexity of COVID-19 transmission.","This study monitors virus amonts and naturally-created blood antibodies, which combat foreign viruses, of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes a breathing-related viral disorder, among infected patients and carries without symptoms from returning healthy travelers. The throat swabs, mucus, and poop samples from 57 hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, and 8 virus carries without symptoms, among 170 returning healthy travelers, were tested with a molecular tool. Results show higher virus amount in throat, mucus, and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptoms first showed among severely ill COVID-19 patients. Shorter virus lifetime (1-8 days) was seen in the throat near the mount and digestive tract of carriers without symptoms. Specific blood antibody detection rates were 18/37 (51.4%) and 23/37 (62.6%) among the 29 confirmed patients and 8 carriers without symptoms, respectively, within 66 days from start of symptoms or detection. Average duration between start of symptoms and antibody results was 30 and 23 days, respectively. Of the 170 returning healthy-travelers to China, 4.7% were infected showing no symptoms (8/170) within 2 weeks. Antibdoy detection rate was 12.8% (12/94). Antibody detection confirmed 3 suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, despite other test results not detecting the virus. Relative to other breathing-related viral infectious diseases, COVID-19 has fewer carriers without symptoms, lower antibody response rates, and a longer antibody production duration in recovered and contacted healthy people. These results show the complexity of COVID-19 spread.","This study aims to monitor the amount of coronavirus (which causes COVID-19 - the breathing-related illness) in the blood, also called viral load, and the specific, infection-fighting proteins used by the immune system, called antibodies, among patients with coronavirus and healthy travelers who have the virus but no symptoms. Samples from 57 hospitalized Covid-19 patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers (people who have the virus but no symptoms) are tested. Among seriously ill Covid-19 patients, there is a higher viral load in the throat, sputum (lung), and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptoms start. Among carriers with no symptoms, the viral load is found to stay for a shorter time period (1-8 days) in the throat and in the digestive system. Antibodies to fight the viruses responded in 51.4% of confirmed patients and 62.6% among asymptomatic people within 66 days from symptom starting. The average time between the start of symptoms and positive (or detected) antibodies is 30 days for the IgG antibody, and 23 days for the IgM antibodies, which often suggest a recent infection. Of 170 returning healthy-travelers to China, 4.7% were asymptomatic carriers within 2 weeks, and the positive result among them for the IgG and IgM antibodies is 12.8%. The IgM/IgG antibodies confirmed 3 suspected coronavirus cases, even though they tested negative for coronavirus using another test. When compared to other viruses that impact the lungs, Covid-19 has fewer asymptotic carriers and has a lower antibody response. Covid-19 also has a longer period of time developing antibodies in recovered patients. These findings highlight how complex transmission or spread is in Covid-19."

Physical examination revealed right lower quadrant tenderness and nodularity just above an abdominoplasty scar. Subsequent computed tomography scan demonstrated a 1 cm by 1 cm hypovascular pocket arising from the cecum with protrusion into the anterior abdominal wall.

17,12224233,"The patient who presents with a serious head injury is often very difficult to manage. The airways is of primary concern; adequate ventilation must be provided and aspiration protected against. Recent studies suggest that hyperventilation may be as beneficial as was earlier believed. As the pCO2 level decreases, vasoconstriction occurs. If the level falls too low, cerebral perfusion is restricted, and profound cerebral anoxia may ensue. Current standards call for a ventilatory rate to allow for moderate respiratory alkalosis, in theory to mildly constrict teh vessels but still provide adequate perfusion. Arterial blood gas analysis in the ED is the definitive measurement of airway management in the field. Remember that the anatomy of the meningeal layers places the arteries primarily in the epidural space and the veins in the subdural space. A bleed in the epidural space often presents with a rapid onset of signs and symptoms, as was obvious in this traumatized patient. When a bleed occurs in the subdural space, the onset is usually more insidious, and an accurate history is a key to field diagnosis. As the hemorrhage expands, compression displaces the brain within the cranial vault. This displacement causes pressure to be exerted on the medulla of the brainstem. Cushing's Traid is a result of this pressure on the medulla and is evidence by the pulse slowing while systolic blood pressure rises and respirations become ataxic. Vomiting is often associated, and as the bleed continues, herniation syndrome begins. Decorticate posturing is displayed, followed by decerebrate posturing if relief is not provided. It is important to distinguish between decorticate and decerebrate posturing. It is important to distinguish between decorticate and decerebrate posturing. An easy way to remember the differences is to picture the anatomy of the brain. The cerebral cortex lies above the cerebellum, so when a patient's arms flexed up toward the face , he is pointing to his ""core"" (de-cor-ticate). As the arms extend downward, he is pointing to his cerebellum(de-cere-brate). T o manage the head-injured patient, it is imperative to anticipate potential developments, as well as protect against underlying injuries that may not be fully evaluated until arrival at the ED. Cervical spine often accompany head injuries, and full spinal immobilization is a mandatory precaution in all presentations. With the expanding hematoma found on this patient's neck, vascular damage ws obvious and contributed to the suspicion of spinal injury. As the intracranial pressure rise, vomiting and seizures are common. Placement of an endotracheal tube and having suction equipment ready are the best tools to prevent against aspiration. It is possible to angle the long spine board 10-15 degrees, exercising caution to ensure the patient's spinal alignment is not manipulated during the process. Seizures are usually treated with anticonvulsants like Valium. When a seizure accompanies a head injury, it is a direct result of the increased intracranial pressure and has a generally poor response to Valium, as the underlying cause of the seizure still exists. In this case, the patient had a full neuromuscular blockade, and any seizure would not have been recognized as long as the paralytics were on board. Early notification to the ED is essential, reporting all findings and interventions. This can alert them and give them the opportunity to prepare specialized equipment, such as CT scanners, mechanical ventilators, etc. Also, consider transportation options and the length of time to definitive care, including neurosurgical evaluation. This patient needs to be seen in a trauma center capable of the most thorough evaluation and management. Evacuation by air ambulance may be the most appropriate method of transport.","A person with a serious head injury is often very difficult to treat. The airways are the most important concern; enough air movement must be provided, and material entering the airway or lungs by accident must be avoided. Recent studies suggest that quick breathing or hyperventilation may be as helpful as was thought before. As the amount of carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the blood decreases, blood vessels narrow. If the amount of carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the blood gets too low, blood flow to the brain is limited, and not enough oxygen getting to the brain may follow. Current standards suggest a rate of movement of air into and out of the lungs to allow for a decrease in carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the blood, in theory to narrow the vessels but still allow enough circulation of blood through organs and tissues. Measuring oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood in the emergency department is the best measurement of airway treatment by first responders. Remember that the structure of the brain's protective layers puts the arteries in the space between the outermost layer and the skull (epidural) and the veins in the space between the outermost layer and the brain (subdural). A bleed in the epidural space often has quick signs and symptoms, as was obvious in this injured patient. A bleed in the subdural space usually happens more slowly, and knowing what happened to the person is key to a diagnosis by first responders. As the bleeding spreads, pressure pushing on the brain moves the brain within the skull. This movement of the brain puts pressure on the area of the brain that controls things like heartbeat and breathing (medulla). Pressure on the medulla causes Cushing's Triad, which is a slowing heartbeat while blood pressure increases and breathing becomes abnormal. Vomiting often occurs, and as the bleed continues, something inside the skull produces pressure that moves brain tissues. A person gets stiff with bent arms, clenched fists, and legs held out straight (decorticate posturing), followed by the arms and legs being held straight out, the toes being pointed downward, and the head and neck being arched backward (decerebrate posturing) if relief is not given. It is important to recognize the difference between decorticate and decerebrate posturing. It is important to recognize the differences between decorticate and decerebrate posturing. An easy way to remember the differences is to picture the structure of the brain. One part of the brain, the cerebral cortex, lies above another part of the brain, the cerebellum, so when a patient's arms point toward the face, he is pointing to his ""core"" (de-cor-ticate). As the arms go down to his side, he is pointing to his cerebellum (de-cere-brate). To treat the patient with a head injury, it is important to predict what might happen, and protect against other injuries that may not be realized until the patient gets to the hospital. Neck injuries often happen with head injuries, and making sure the spine cannot move is required in all cases. With the growing bruise on this patient's neck, damage to blood vessels was clear and helped lead to the belief of a spinal injury. As the pressure in the brain rises, vomiting and seizures are common. Putting in a breathing tube and having suction tools ready are the best ways to prevent material entering the airway or lungs by accident. It is possible to angle the rescue board 10-15 degrees, making sure to not change the alignment of the patient's spine. Seizures are usually treated with drugs that prevent convulsions, like Valium. When a seizure happens with a head injury, it is caused by rising pressure in the brain, and Valium does not usually help, as the cause for the seizure is not resolved. In this case, the patient had a full nerve block (paralyzed skeletal muscles). Any seizure would not have been seen while the paralyzing drugs were working. Notifying the emergency department is very important, reporting everything the first responders see and do to treat the patient. This can warn emergency staff and give them the chance to get specialized equipment ready (e.g., CT scanners, mechanical ventilators). Also, think about how to get the patient to the hospital and how much time it will take to best care for the patient, including seeing a brain surgeon. This patient needs to be seen in a trauma center able to do the most complete evaluation and treatment. A medical helicopter may be the best way to get the patient to the hospital.",

44,29329171,"Background: We endeavored to develop clinically translatable nonhuman primate (NHP) models of severe polytraumatic hemorrhagic shock. Methods: NHPs were randomized into five severe pressure-targeted hemorrhagic shock (PTHS) ± additional injuries scenarios: 30-min PTHS (PTHS-30), 60-min PTHS (PTHS-60), PTHS-60 + soft tissue injury (PTHS-60+ST), PTHS-60+ ST + femur fracture (PTHS-60+ST+FF), and decompensated PTHS+ST+FF (PTHS-D). Physiologic parameters were recorded and blood samples collected at five time points with animal observation through T = 24 h. Results presented as mean ± SEM; statistics: log transformation followed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparisons, Wilcoxon nonparametric test for comparisons, and the Friedmans' one-way ANOVA; significance: P < 0.05. Results: Percent blood loss was 40% ± 2, 59% ± 3, 52% ± 3, 49% ± 2, and 54% ± 2 for PTHS-30, PTHS-60, PTHS-60+ST, PTHS-60+ST+FF, and PTHS-D, respectively. All animals survived to T = 24 h except one in each of the PTHS-60 and PTHS-60+ST+FF groups and seven in the PTHS-D group. Physiologic, coagulation, and inflammatory parameters demonstrated increasing derangements with increasing model severity. Conclusion: NHPs exhibit a high degree of resilience to hemorrhagic shock and polytrauma as evidenced by moderate perturbations in metabolic, coagulation, and immunologic outcomes with up to 60 min of profound hypotension regardless of injury pattern. Extending the duration of PTHS to the point of decompensation in combination with polytraumatic injury, evoked derangements consistent with those observed in severely injured trauma patients which would require ICU care. Thus, we have successfully established a clinically translatable NHP trauma model for use in testing therapeutic interventions to trauma.","This study aimed to develop nonhuman primate (monkey) (NHP) models of severe polytraumatic (many-injury) hemorrhagic (excessive bleeding) shock that are applicable to human health settings. NHPs were placed into five pressure-targeted hemorrhagic shock (PTHS) scenarios.

23,7766949,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a large number of mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus, most of which are strongly associated with specific RFLP or VNTR haplotypes. One of the major questions remaining in PKU research is why this apparently maladaptive disorder has been maintained at a frequency of approximately 1 in 10,000 among Caucasians. A growing number of studies have provided evidence that both the relatively high frequency of PKU and the strong mutation/haplotype associations might reflect the existence of multiple founding populations for PKU. Examples of putative founding populations for PKU in both Europe and Asia will be presented. Some PAH mutations are associated with multiple haplotypes, suggesting recurrence. Evidence for and against recurrence as the mechanism responsible for the association of the R408W mutation with RFLP haplotypes 1 and 2 will be discussed.","Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disorder inherited from both parents caused by many changes at the location of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) protein. It is a disorder in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy because it cannot process a molecule (phenylalanine). One of the main questions scientists still have is why PKU happens in roughly 1 in 10,000 white people at any point in time. More and more studies have suggested that both the high amount of the population with PKU at any point in time and the strong gene changes that go with this set of changes and variations might show more than one group of people in which PKU first developed. We will show populations thought to be where PKU first developed in both Europe and Asia. Some PAH changes go with many sets of gene variations, suggesting these changes happen more than once. We will discuss information that supports and rejects these changes happening more than once, causing one change to happen in two sets of gene changes.",
8,16034865,"Background: Antipsychotic drugs are usually given orally but compliance with medication given by this route may be difficult to quantify. The development of depot injections in the 1960s gave rise to extensive use of depots as a means of long-term maintenance treatment. Perphenazine decanoate and enanthate are depot antipsychotics that belong to the phenothiazine family and have a piperazine ethanol side chain. Objectives: To assess the effects of depot perphenazine decanoate and enanthate versus placebo, oral antipsychotics and other depot antipsychotic preparations for people with schizophrenia in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes. Authors' conclusions: Depot perphenazine is in clinical use in the Nordic countries, Belgium, Portugal and the Netherlands. At a conservative estimate, a quarter of a million people suffer from schizophrenia in those countries and could be treated with depot perphenazine. The total number of participants in the four trials with useful data is 313. None of the studies observed the effects of oral versus depot antipsychotic drugs. Until well conducted and reported randomised trials are undertaken clinicians will be in doubt as to the effects of perphenazine depots and people with schizophrenia should exercise their own judgement or ask to be randomised.","Drugs used to treat psychotic disorders are usually given by mouth, but it is hard to measure if people take the drugs as instructed. Slow-releasing shots, created in the 1960s, became popular as long-term treatment to keep conditions stable. Perphenazine decanoate and enanthate are slow-release shots used to treat psychotic disorders. We aimed to measure the medical, social, and economic effects of slow-releasing perphenazine decanoate and enanthate shots compared to no treatment, drugs used to treat psychotic disorders by mouth, and other slow-releasing shots used to treat psychotic disorders for people with schizophrenia (a reality-distorting mental illness). We state that slow-releasing perphenazine shots are used in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Portugal, and the Netherlands. At least 250,000 people have schizophrenia in these countries and could be given slow-releasing perphenazine shots. The four trials with useful results had 313 total people. None of the studies compared the effects of antipsychotics taken by mouth to a slow-releasing shot. People with schizophrenia should use their own judgement until more studies are done and doctors know the effects of slow-release perphenazine shots.",

12,17351472,"Purpose of review: The prevalence of asthma is increasing in many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries. The present review focuses on recent literature regarding asthma prevention in childhood. Recent findings: Several environmental exposures in infancy or early childhood are associated with reduced prevalence of asthma, but the mechanisms leading to these associations remain unknown. Recent studies have demonstrated limited success in the prevention of asthma or asthma symptoms with the use of asthma medications, once the therapy is discontinued. Immunotherapy offers another strategy for asthma prevention, and groups treated with this intervention have demonstrated reduced atopy and asthma. Several multi-interventional trials have demonstrated a reduced asthma symptom burden but have not demonstrated significant differences in objective measures such as lung function or bronchial hyper-responsiveness between intervention groups. Summary: The most promising asthma prevention strategies to date have been those that use a multi-interventional approach employing both dietary and environmental manipulations. More research is needed to assess the long-term follow-up of multi-interventional trials and to evaluate novel intervention strategies in the primary or secondary prevention of asthma in childhood.","Asthma is a long-term condition that affects the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs and makes it hard to breathe. The number of asthma cases is increasing in many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries (countries with a high quality of life, developed economies, and advanced technologies). The present review focuses on recent literature on asthma prevention in childhood. Recent findings show that exposure to some things in the environment as an infant or in early childhood is associated with reduced number of asthma cases, but how these associations are connected is unknown. Recent studies also show limited success in preventing asthma or asthma symptoms when asthma medications are used and then those medicines are stopped. Immunotherapy (treatment that activates or alters the immune system to treat a disease) is another way to prevent asthma. Several studies that use multiple treatment (drugs, therapy, or other steps to improve health) methods showed reduced symptoms of asthma, but these studies did not see any major differences in other measures, such as how well the lungs carried air. In summary, the most promising way to prevent asthma is to use more than one treatment that include changing environmental exposures and diet. More research is needed to understand how the effect of multiple treatments last and to evaluate new treatments to prevent asthma in childhood.","The prevalence of asthma (a disease that restricts breathing) is increasing globally, especially in developed countries. This article focuses on the literature of asthma prevention in childhood. Many early experiences with the environment are linked with reduced widespreadness of asthma, but the reasons are unknown. Recent studies show little success in preventing asthma or its effects with asthma medications, once therapy ends. Immunotherapy, treatment of disease by altering immune system activity, is another treatment for preventing asthma. Groups treated with immunotherapy show fewer allergy developments and asthma. Many multi-treatment trials show reduced intensity of the effects of asthma but not changes in measures like lung function or sensitivity between treatment groups. The most promising prevention treatments of asthma have used multi-treatment strategies with both diet and environmental changes. We need more evidence to measure the effects of multi-treatment trials and new strategies for asthma prevention in childhood."

The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy and safety of M-PCNL and RIRS in kidney stone treatment over 50 years old patients. A total of 125 patients, 65 of whom had RIRS, and 60 of whom had M-PCNL, were included in the study. Age, gender, BMI (Body-Mass Index), ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) scores of the patients; stone size, stone location, operation side, ESWL history, HU (Hounsfield Unit) values, hospital stay durations, SFR, complication rates according to Clavien modification system, postoperative hemoglobin loss, postoperative transfusion rates, and patients who needed a secondary operation were recorded. SFR values were calculated in the postoperative third and sixth months. The data between the two groups had similar characteristics in terms of age, gender, BMI, HU, stone size, operation side, stone location, ESWL history, operation time, postoperative transfusion rate, postoperative Clavien complications (p > 0.05). When the ASA categories were evaluated, the mean ASA scores, ASA I, and ASA II data had similar characteristics in both groups (p > 0.05). When the ASA 3 scores were evaluated, the number of ASA III patients in the RIRS group was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.05). When hospital stay duration and postoperative hemoglobin loss were examined, RIRS group was found to be advantageous (p < 0.05). Postoperative third month SFR and Postoperative sixth month values were statistically significantly higher in M-PCNL group (p < 0.05). M-PCNL and RIRS are methods that can be used safely and effectively over 50 years old patients in kidney stone surgery. M-PCNL has been found to be more advantageous in terms of SFR rates and as it requires less secondary intervention. RIRS is advantageous in terms of short hospital stay, postoperative hemoglobin loss, and applicability to patients who are not suitable for the prone position.","Two common ways to treat kidney stones are: the Mini-Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (M-PCNL), which is when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a scope to remove kidney stones, and Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS), a procedure that uses a laser and a viewing tube to remove kidney stones and does not make an external incision. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of M-PCNL and RIRS in kidney stone treatment in patients over 50 years old.

Age, gender, BMI (Body-Mass Index), ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) scores of the patients; stone size, stone location, operation side, having extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy or ESWL procedure in the past, HU (Hounsfield Unit) values to measure the density of stones, length of hospital stays, stone-free rates, complication rates, blood loss after the procedure, transfusions needed after the procedure, and patients who needed a second operation are recorded. Stone-free rates are calculated 3 months and 6 months after the procedure. The data between the RIRS and M-PCNL groups have similar characteristics in age, gender, BMI, HU, stone size, operation side, stone location, ESWL history, operation time, transfusion rates needed after the procedure, and complications after the procedure. When the ASA categories are evaluated to determine the risk of surgery before the procedure, the average ASA scores, ASA I, and ASA II data had similar characteristics in both groups. When the ASA 3 scores are evaluated, the number of ASA III patients in the RIRS group is statistically significantly (the result is unlikely to be random or by chance) higher. When hospital stay duration and blood loss after surgery are examined, the RIRS group is found to be beneficial. The stone-free rate at the 3rd and 6th months after surgery are statistically significantly higher in the M-PCNL group. M-PCNL and RIRS are methods that can be used safely and effectively in patients over 50 years old who need kidney stone surgery. M-PCNL is found to be more advantageous in terms of stone-free rates, and it requires less secondary interventions, such as a second procedure. RIRS is beneficial in terms of short hospital stays, blood loss after surgery, and applicability to patients who are not suitable for the prone position when patients are face down on the stomach.",
32,30372582,"Objective: In a subgroup analysis of the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial, we aimed to explore the impact of folic acid supplementation on arterial stiffness and assess the modifying effect of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene in Chinese patients with hypertension. Methods: This prospective study enrolled 2529 hypertensive Chinese patients. Participants were randomized to receive treatment with either a combination of enalapril and folic acid or enalapril. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by trained medical staff using PWV instruments at both baseline and exit visits, approximately 5 years after enrollment. This trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00794885). Results: During the follow-up, change in folate was significantly and independently correlated with change in ba-PWV in study patients (β = -1.31, P < 0.001). Individuals with CC genotype had a significantly greater PWV response to folic acid supplementation than did carriers of the T allele (β = -2.79, P < 0.001 for CC homozygotes compared with β = -0.56, P = 0.464 for TT homozygotes). The positive effect of folic acid on improved PWV was modified by the MTHFR genotype (P for interaction = 0.034). Conclusion: In a subgroup of Chinese hypertensive patients who had received 5-year antihypertensive therapy, increases in folate status were associated with higher reductions in PWV, and individuals with the CC genotype showed greatest PWV response to folic acid supplementation.","This study conducted an analysis using patients from the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial. The goal of this study was to explore the impact of folic acid (a specific vitamin) on arterial stiffness (hardness of arteries or specific blood vessels).

Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a measurement of arterial stiffness. It is measured by looking at the brachial and tibial arteries, located within the upper arm. PWV was taken by trained medical staff using appropriate equipment during both baseline (before treatment) and exit (end of treatment) visits, approximately 5 years after enrollment. This trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00794885). During the follow-up, change in folate (vitamin in the body) was significantly and independently linked with change in PWV in patients. Patients with CC genotype (a person's collection of specific genes) had a significantly greater PWV response to folic acid than those with genotype CT or TT. The positive effect of folic acid on improved PWV was modified by what genotype the patient had. The study concluded that within the analyzed subgroup of Chinese hypertensive patients who had received a 5-year antihypertensive therapy, increase in folate status were correlated or linked with decreased PWV. Additionally, individuals with CC genotype showed greatest PWV response to folic acid treatment.",

16,1604250,"It is thought that glucocorticosteroids impair the clearance of immune complexes by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). We studied the effect of a five day course of prednisone (1 mg/kg body weight per day) on MPS function in 10 healthy volunteers, using soluble radiolabeled aggregates of human immunoglobulin G as a probe. MPS function was assessed before steroid treatment, and again 24 hours after the last dose of prednisone. Elimination kinetics and the uptake of the immunoglobulin aggregates by liver and spleen did not change after prednisone treatment. This suggests that, in contrast to general belief, high doses of glucocorticosteroids have no direct, acute effect on MPS function.","It is though that glucocorticosteroids (strong medicines that fight inflammation and work with the immune system) disrupt the elimination of immune complexes (build-up in the blood that can cause infection and problems with the immune system) by the mononuclear phagocyte system (a family of cells that fight foreign substances and are part of the immune system). Researchers studied the effect of a five day course of prednisone (a type of steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling) on how the mononuclear phagocyte system functions in 10 healthy volunteers using soluble (can be dissolved in water) build-up of human immunoglobulin G (an common antibody in the body that protects against infection) as a tool to monitor. The mononuclear phagocyte system function is assessed before giving the steroid treatment and again 24 hours after the last dose of prednisone. The elimination reaction and the use of the immunoglobulin by the liver and spleen did not change after prednisone treatment.

39,34638669,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are found in all biological fluids, providing potential for the identification of disease biomarkers such as colorectal cancer (CRC). EVs are heavily glycosylated with specific glycoconjugates such as tetraspanins, integrins, and mucins, reflecting the characteristics of the original cell offering valuable targets for detection of CRC. We report here on europium-nanoparticle (EuNP)-based assay to detect and characterize different surface glycoconjugates of EVs without extensive purification steps from five different CRC and the HEK 293 cell lines. The promising EVs candidates from cell culture were clinically evaluated on small panel of serum samples including early-stage (n = 11) and late-stage (n = 11) CRC patients, benign condition (n = 11), and healthy control (n = 10). The majority of CRC cell lines expressed tetraspanin sub-population and glycovariants of integrins and conventional tumor markers. The subpopulation of CD151 having CD63 expression (CD151CD63) was significantly (p = 0.001) elevated in early-stage CRC (8 out of 11) without detecting any benign and late-stage samples, while conventional CEA detected mostly late-stage CRC (p = 0.045) and with only four early-stage cases. The other glycovariant assays such as CEACon-A, CA125WGA, CA 19.9Ma696, and CA 19.9Con-A further provided some complementation to the CD151CD63 assay. These results indicate the potential application of CD151CD63 assay for early detection of CRC patients in human serum.","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are found in all biological fluids. EVs are released by cells and are used as carriers of biomarkers. Biomarkers are measurable substances that can indicate illness. Because of this, EVs can potentially help identify diseases, such as colorectal cancer (CRC) or cancer of the colon. EVs are heavily modified with carbohydrates or sugar-carrying molecules, such as tetraspanins, integrins, and mucins. This modification allows EVs to reflect the characteristics of the original cell. Because EVs reflect the original cells, they can offer valuable targets for detection of CRC. This study reports on a testing assay (device) to detect and characterize different surface carbohydrates of EVs. The assay no longer requires extensive purification (filtration) steps. The assay is tested in five different CRC and the HEK 293 cell lines. HEK 293 cells are human kidney cells.

33,29018999,"The objective of this study was to perform population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of gabapentin in healthy Korean subjects and to investigate the possible effect of genetic polymorphisms (1236C > T, 2677G > T/A, and 3435C > T) of ABCB1 gene on PK parameters of gabapentin. Data were collected from bioequivalence studies, in which 173 subjects orally received three different doses of gabapentin (300, 400, and 800 mg). Only data from reference formulation were used. Population pharmacokinetics (PKs) of gabapentin was estimated using a nonlinear mixed-effects model (NONMEM). Gabapentin showed considerable inter-individual variability (from 5.2- to 8.7-fold) in PK parameters. Serum concentration of gabapentin was well fitted by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and lag time. An inhibitory Emax model was applied to describe the effect of dose on bioavailability. The oral clearance was estimated to be 11.1 L/h. The volume of distribution was characterized as 81.0 L. The absorption rate constant was estimated at 0.860 h-1, and the lag time was predicted at 0.311 h. Oral bioavailability was estimated to be 68.8% at dose of 300 mg, 62.7% at dose of 400 mg, and 47.1% at dose of 800 mg. The creatinine clearance significantly influenced on the oral clearance (P < 0.005) and ABCB1 2677G > T/A genotypes significantly influenced on the absorption rate constant (P < 0.05) of gabapentin. However, ABCB1 1236C > T and 3435C > T genotypes showed no significant effect on gabapentin PK parameters. The results of the present study indicate that the oral bioavailability of gabapentin is decreased when its dosage is increased. In addition, ABCB1 2677G > T/A polymorphism can explain the substantial inter-individual variability in the absorption of gabapentin.","The objective of this study is to perform an analysis on how the nerve-related pain medication gabapentin performs in healthy Korean participants and to investigate the possible effect of genetic changes in the drug-resistant ABCB1 gene on how gabapentin is absorbed and distributed in the body. Data are collected from other studies where 173 people received three different doses by mouth (orally) of gabapentin. Only data on the drug design and performance are used. How the body handles and uses gabapentin is measured. Gabapentin shows a lot of variation or differences between people in how it is absorbed, distributed and released from the body. Blood concentration of gabapentin is used to understand the process of distributing and eliminating the medication from the body. How the dose amount impacts availability in the body is measured. The oral clearance is estimated to be 11.1 liters per hour. The volume of distribution was characterized as 81.0 L. How quickly the medication enters the body remains steady. Availability of the drug from the oral dose is estimated to be 68.8% at a dose of 300 mg, 62.7% at a dose of 400 mg, and 47.1% at a dose of 800 mg. Clearing creatinine (a waste product that comes from wear and tear of the muscles) influences the oral clearance, and ABCB1 genes influence how quickly gabapentin is absorbed by the body. However, genes showed no significant effect on gabapentin drug activity parameters. The results of this study suggest that the availability of gabapentin to the body when taken by mouth is decreased when the dosage is increased. In addition, changes in the ABCB1 gene can explain the major differences in how gabapentin is absorbed by the body between people.",
23,31364419,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is considered to be a paradigm for a monogenic metabolic disorder but was never thought to be a primary application for human gene therapy due to established alternative treatment. However, somewhat unanticipated improvement in neuropsychiatric outcome upon long-term treatment of adults with PKU with enzyme substitution therapy might slowly change this assumption. In parallel, PKU was for a long time considered to be an excellent test system for experimental gene therapy of a Mendelian autosomal recessive defect of the liver due to an outstanding mouse model and the easy to analyze and well-defined therapeutic end point, that is, blood l-phenylalanine concentration. Lifelong treatment by targeting the mouse liver (or skeletal muscle) was achieved using different approaches, including (1) recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) or nonviral naked DNA vector-based gene addition, (2) genome editing using base editors delivered by rAAV vectors, and (3) by delivering rAAVs for promoter-less insertion of the PAH-cDNA into the Pah locus. In this article we summarize the gene therapeutic attempts of correcting a mouse model for PKU and discuss the future implications for human gene therapy.","Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a model of a disorder controlled by a single gene in which the body cannot properly turn some food into energy.

24,7714222,"Forty-four patients with DSM-III-R generalized anxiety disorder participated in this double-blind, randomized study. Patients were on a benzodiazepine before the study and were stabilized on 3 to 5 mg/day lorazepam for 5 weeks (weeks 0 to 5). Thereafter, they were randomized to 15 mg/day buspirone or placebo for the following 6 weeks (weeks 6 to 11). During the first 2 weeks of double-blind, randomized treatment (weeks 6 to 7), lorazepam was tapered off. During weeks 12 to 13, patients received single-blind placebo. Assessment included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Zung and Eddy Self-Rating Scale of Anxiety Symptoms, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Rome Depression Inventory, completed at weeks 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13. Side effects were assessed through the Dosage Treatment Emergent Symptoms at the same times. The benzodiazepine-withdrawal syndrome was evaluated through a 27-symptom checklist (Clinical-Rated Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Schedule) at weeks 0, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 13. The results showed that buspirone was more effective than placebo and comparable to lorazepam. Buspirone-treated patients showed no rebound anxiety or benzodiazepine-withdrawal syndrome compared with placebo. Buspirone caused fewer side effects than lorazepam and was not different from placebo in this respect.

At the same times, we measured side effects using another questionnaire. At the beginning of the study and weeks 5, 6, 7, 11, and 13, we measured withdrawal symptoms using a common checklist. The results favored buspirone over sugar pills and were similar to lorazepam. Patients taking buspirone showed no signs of anxiety symptoms returning or withdrawal symptoms compared to sugar pills. Buspirone, similar to sugar pills, caused fewer side effects than lorazepam. Finally the anti-anxiety effects of buspirone lasted at least 2 weeks after patients stopped taking the studied drugs.",
38,19035067,"A pressure ulcer is a localized injury to the skin or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of unrelieved pressure. Predisposing factors are classified as intrinsic (e.g., limited mobility, poor nutrition, comorbidities, aging skin) or extrinsic (e.g., pressure, friction, shear, moisture). Prevention includes identifying at-risk persons and implementing specific prevention measures, such as following a patient repositioning schedule; keeping the head of the bed at the lowest safe elevation to prevent shear; using pressure-reducing surfaces; and assessing nutrition and providing supplementation, if needed. When an ulcer occurs, documentation of each ulcer (i.e., size, location, eschar and granulation tissue, exudate, odor, sinus tracts, undermining, and infection) and appropriate staging (I through IV) are essential to the wound assessment. Treatment involves management of local and distant infections, removal of necrotic tissue, maintenance of a moist environment for wound healing, and possibly surgery. Debridement is indicated when necrotic tissue is present. Urgent sharp debridement should be performed if advancing cellulitis or sepsis occurs. Mechanical, enzymatic, and autolytic debridement methods are nonurgent treatments. Wound cleansing, preferably with normal saline and appropriate dressings, is a mainstay of treatment for clean ulcers and after debridement. Bacterial load can be managed with cleansing. Topical antibiotics should be considered if there is no improvement in healing after 14 days. Systemic antibiotics are used in patients with advancing cellulitis, osteomyelitis, or systemic infection.","A pressure ulcer is an injury to the skin or underlying tissue, usually over a bony portion of the body, caused by unrelieved pressure. Factors that make someone more likely to have a pressure ulcer are classified as intrinsic (internal factors) or extrinsic (external factors). Intrinsic factors include limited mobility, poor nutrition, comorbidities, or aging skin. Extrinsic factors include pressure, friction, shear (vertical force), or moisture. There are several preventative protocols for pressure ulcers that can be used. These protocols include identifying at-risk persons and implementing specific prevention measures. Preventative measures include repositioning patients on a schedule, keeping hospital beds at a low and safe elevation to prevent shear, using pressure-reducing surfaces, and assessing (measuring) nutrition and providing supplementation. When an ulcer occurs, wound assessment is needed. When assessing each ulcer, there are several factors that need to be identified. These include ulcer size, location, dead or irregular tissue, discharge, odor, sinus tracts (channels in the skin), wound edge erosion or edge removal, infection, and appropriate staging (I through IV). Treatment involves managing local and spreading infections, removal of dead tissue, maintenance of a moist environment for wound healing, and possibly surgery. Debridement, or removal of damaged tissue from a wound, is indicated when necrotic or dead tissue is present. Urgent sharp debridement should be performed if advancing skin or bleed infection occurs. Mechanical (surgery), enzymatic (chemical agents), and autolytic debridement (body's natural defense system) methods are nonurgent treatments. Wound cleansing, preferably with normal saline (salt water) and appropriate dressings, is common for treatment for clean ulcers and after removal of damaged skin. Bacterial load, or the amount of bacteria within the body, can be managed with cleansing. Topical antibiotics are bacterial-fighting medicines applied to the skin. They should be considered if there is no improvement in healing after 14 days. Systemic antibiotics are medicines normally taken in pill form that effects the whole body. These are used in patients with advancing deep skin infection, bone infection, or whole body infection.","A pressure ulcer (bedsore) is a area-limited injury to the skin and neaby body parts, usually over a bone, due to unrelieved pressure. Risk factors can be intrinsic (e.g., limited movement, poor diet, other diseases, aging skin) or extrinsic (e.g, pressure, friction, strain, moisure). Prevention includes identifying at-risk people and applying preventative measures, like regularly moving the patient's position, keeping the bed head low to prevent strain, using pressure-reducing surfaces, evaluating diet and giving diet supplemets, if needed. When an ulcer occurs, examining it (i.e., size, location, type of affected tissue, leaking fluid, odor, wound openings, wear and tea, and infection) and the severity of the ulcer are essential to wound assessment. Treatment includes managing nearby and far-away infetions, removing dead body tissue, maintaining a moist environment for wound healing, and even surgery. Removing damaged body tissue (debridement) is needed when dead tissue is present. Urgent debridement should be done if bacterial skin infections develop.

34,23636234,"Protein-energy wasting (PEW), characterized by a decline in body protein mass and energy reserves, including muscle and fat wasting and visceral protein pool contraction, is an underappreciated condition in early to moderate stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a strong predictor of adverse outcomes. The prevalence of PEW in early to moderate CKD is ≥20-25% and increases as CKD progresses, in part because of activation of proinflammatory cytokines combined with superimposed hypercatabolic states and declines in appetite. This anorexia leads to inadequate protein and energy intake, which may be reinforced by prescribed dietary restrictions and inadequate monitoring of the patient's nutritional status. Worsening uremia also renders CKD patients vulnerable to potentially deleterious effects of uncontrolled diets, including higher phosphorus and potassium burden. Uremic metabolites, some of which are anorexigenic and many of which are products of protein metabolism, can exert harmful effects, ranging from oxidative stress to endothelial dysfunction, nitric oxide disarrays, renal interstitial fibrosis, sarcopenia, and worsening proteinuria and kidney function. Given such complex pathways, nutritional interventions in CKD, when applied in concert with nonnutritional therapeutic approaches, encompass an array of strategies (such as dietary restrictions and supplementations) aimed at optimizing both patients' biochemical variables and their clinical outcomes. The applicability of many nutritional interventions and their effects on outcomes in patients with CKD with PEW has not been well studied. This article reviews the definitions and pathophysiology of PEW in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, examines the current indications for various dietary modification strategies in patients with CKD (eg, manufactured protein-based supplements, amino acids and their keto acid or hydroxyacid analogues), discusses the rationale behind their potential use in patients with PEW, and highlights areas in need of further research.","Protein-energy wasting is a decline in the amount of protein in the body and leads to less stored energy. It is a condition present in early to moderate stages of chronic kidney disease and a signal that negative health outcomes may occur. Protein-energy wasting often increases as chronic kidney disease gets worse, in part because of more inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) combined with too much breakdown of proteins and loss of appetite. This leads to not enough proteins and energy, which may be held up by dietary restrictions from doctors and not enough monitoring of how the patient's nutrition impacts their health. Worsening uremia, which is when there is too much waste in the blood, may make uncontrolled diets have a negative impact on chronic disease patients. Too many waste products in the blood that would normally be removed by urine can have harmful effects, including an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants in the body (which can lead to cell and tissue damage), endothelial dysfunction which is damaged functioning of the lining of blood vessels impacting the heart, and other conditions. Nutritional interventions (changing diet and diet behavior to reach a health goal) in chronic kidney disease, when combined with other therapies unrelated to nutrition, create a number of strategies aimed at improving the internal systems of the body in the patient and the patient's health outcomes. How nutritional interventions can work and their effects on patients with chronic kidney disease with protein-energy wasting is not well studied. This article reviews the definitions and the process of protein-energy wasting in patients with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis, and examines when changes in the diet is appropriate and areas that need further research.",
6,27852303,"Background: Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder and the most common cause of hypothyroidism. The use of Nigella sativa, a potent herbal medicine, continues to increase worldwide as an alternative treatment of several chronic diseases including hyperlipidemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of Nigella sativa on thyroid function, serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) - 1, Nesfatin-1 and anthropometric features in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Methods: Forty patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, aged between 22 and 50 years old, participated in the trial and were randomly allocated into two groups of intervention and control receiving powdered Nigella sativa or placebo daily for 8 weeks. Changes in anthropometric variables, dietary intakes, thyroid status, serum VEGF and Nesfatin-1 concentrations after 8 weeks were measured. Results: Treatment with Nigella sativa significantly reduced body weight and body mass index (BMI). Serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies decreased while serum T3 concentrations increased in Nigella sativa-treated group after 8 weeks. There was a significant reduction in serum VEGF concentrations in intervention group. None of these changes had been observed in placebo treated group. In stepwise multiple regression model, changes in waist to hip ratio (WHR) and thyroid hormones were significant predictors of changes in serum VEGF and Nesgfatin-1 values in Nigella sativa treated group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our data showed a potent beneficial effect of powdered Nigella sativa in improving thyroid status and anthropometric variables in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Moreover, Nigella sativa significantly reduced serum VEGF concentrations in these patients. Considering observed health- promoting effect of this medicinal plant in ameliorating the disease severity, it can be regarded as a useful therapeutic approach in management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.","Hashimoto's thyroiditis is caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells and is the most common cause of an underactive thyroid. More people around the world are taking Nigella sativa, a powerful herbal medicine, as a nontraditional way to treat many long-term diseases including high cholesterol, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. The current study aimed to rate the effects of Nigella sativa on how well the thyroid is working, blood Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) - 1 (a protein that promotes new blood vessels), Nesfatin-1 (a chain of amino acids that affects hunger) and physical body measurements in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. We randomly split forty people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and between 22 and 50 years old into two group and gave one group powdered Nigella sativa and the other group sham treatment for 8 weeks. We measured changes in physical body measurements, what people ate, thyroid function, blood VEGF and Nefastin-1 levels after 8 weeks. Taking Nigella sativa caused lower body weight and body mass index (BMI). People taking Nigella sativa had lower blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and antibodies that target the thyroid and higher levels of blood thyroid hormone (T4) after 8 weeks. People taking Nigella sativa had lower blood levels of VEGF. None of these changes were seen in the group who took the sham treatmentl. Based on a statistical model, changes in the ratio of the waist to the hip and thyroid hormones predicted changes in blood VEGF and Nesgfatin-1 levels in the group who took Nigella sativa. We concluded that powdered Nigella sativa improved thyroid function and physical body measurements in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Nigella sativa lowered blood VEGF levels. Nigella sativa can be a useful non-traditional treatment for people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis to make the disease less severe.","Hashimoto's thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation) occurs when immune cells mistakenly attack the body's own healthy cells. It is the most common cause of reduced thyroid function. Nigella sativa, a powerful herbal medicine, increases globally as an alternative treatment for many long-lasting diseases like high blood pressure, high blood fat, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The current work evaluates how Nigella sativa affects thyroid function, blood protein levels, and physical measurements in those with Hashimoto's thyroid inflammation. Forty patients with Hashimoto's thyroid inflammation, aged 22 through 50, were randomly split into two groups receiving powdered Nigella sativa or inactive treatment daily for 8 weeks. Using an herbal medicine reduced body weight and body mass index. Blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid cell proteins decreased while thyroid product levels increased in the Nigella sative-treated group after 8 weeks. The treatment group showed reduced blood vessel signaling protein. No changes occured in the inactive treatment group. Changes in waist to hip ratio and thyroid hormones were linked to changes in certain blood protein levels in the Nigella sative-treated group. Nigella sativa may improve thyroid and general health in those with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation). Also, Nigella sativa (an herbal medicine) reduces blood vessel signaling protein in these patients. Due to its health-promoting effect, this medicinal plant can be a useful treatment for Hashimoto's thyroidits."
6,29490937,"Hypothyroidism is one of the most common hormone deficiencies in adults. Most of the cases, particularly those of overt hypothyroidism, are easily diagnosed and managed, with excellent outcomes if treated adequately. However, minor alterations of thyroid function determine nonspecific manifestations. Primary hypothyroidism due to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is largely the most common cause of thyroid hormone deficiency. Central hypothyroidism is a rare and heterogeneous disorder characterized by decreased thyroid hormone secretion by an otherwise normal thyroid gland, due to lack of TSH. The standard treatment of primary and central hypothyroidism is hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine sodium (LT4). Treatment guidelines of hypothyroidism recommend monotherapy with LT4 due to its efficacy, long-term experience, favorable side effect profile, ease of administration, good intestinal absorption, long serum half-life and low cost. Despite being easily treatable with a daily dose of LT4, many patients remain hypothyroid due to malabsorption syndromes, autoimmune gastritis, pancreatic and liver disorders, drug interactions, polymorphisms in DIO2 (iodothyronine deiodinase 2), high fiber diet, and more frequently, non-compliance to LT4 therapy. Compliance to levothyroxine treatment in hypothyroidism is compromised by daily and fasting schedule. Many adult patients remain hypothyroid due to all the above mentioned and many attempts to improve levothyroxine therapy compliance and absorption have been made.","Underactive thyroid is one of the most common conditions caused by a lack of specific hormones in adults. Underactive thyroid is usually easily identified and successfully treated. However, small changes in thyroid function determine symptoms that can be caused by many conditions. Primary underactive thyroid caused by a long-term inflamed thyroid, which in turn is caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, is the most common cause of too little thyroid hormones in adults. Central underactive thyroid, which is not very common and has many causes, is when an otherwise normal thyroid makes too little thyroid hormone due to lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine (LT4) is the normal treatment of primary and central underactive thyroid. Treatment guidelines for an underactive thyroid recommend a single drug, levothyroxine (LT4), because of how well it works, how long it has been used, few side effects, how easy it is to use, how well it is absorbed in the stomach, how long it lasts in the blood, and low cost. Although taking LT4 daily treats underactive thyroid, many people still have underactive thyroids due to conditions that do not allow absorption in the stomach, inflammation of the stomach lining caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, pancreatic and live disease, two or more drugs interacting with each other, gene variations, eating too much fiber, and more commonly, not following the prescribed LT4 treatment. Taking levothyroxine as prescribed for underactive thyroid depends on when and if it is taken on an empty stomach. For all of these reasons, many adults still have underactive thyroids. Doctors have tried many ways to make people take levothyroxine as prescribed and make levothyroxine more easily absorbed in the stomach.",
37,29671676,"Aim: Randomized Phase I study examining the effects of gabapentinoids gabapentin, pregabalin and gastroretentive gabapentin on simulated driving performance, sedation and cognitive function in healthy volunteers (n = 32). Methods: Driving attentiveness, sleepiness and cognition were evaluated prior to subjects receiving study doses. Blood samples were collected during each treatment. Results: Subjects receiving gastroretentive gabapentin showed less change in variation in lateral lane position (p = 0.0275), less tremor (p = 0.0304) and fewer vision disturbances compared with gabapentin (p = 0.0177). Statistically significant decrease in One Card Learning Test performance was observed after treatment with gastroretentive gabapentin. Conclusion: Gastroretentive gabapentin demonstrated reduced driving impairment and lower scores on key neurotoxicity measures. Further studies in patients with postherpetic neuralgia are needed.","A study investigated the effects of gabapentinoids, drugs often used to prevent and control seizures. The tested drugs include gabapentin, pregabalin and gastroretentive gabapentin. The study evaluated the effects of the drugs on simulated driving performance, sedation (relaxation) and cognitive function (thinking ability). The study was conducted in 32 healthy volunteers. Driving attentiveness, sleepiness, and cognition were evaluated prior to treatment within participants. Blood samples were collected during each treatment. Subjects receiving gastroretentive gabapentin showed less change in variation (differences) in lateral (side) lane position, less tremors (shaking), and fewer vision disturbances compared with gabapentin. Statistically significant decreases in One Card Learning Test (a test used to test short term memory) performance was observed after treatment with gastroretentive gabapentin. The study concluded gastroretentive gabapentin reduced driving impairment and showed lower scores on key neurotoxicity (abnormal nervous system function) measures.

16,7310640,"Six healthy male volunteers were given 5, 20, and 50 mg of oral prednisone and 5, 20, and 400 mg doses of intravenous prednisolone. Plasma and urine concentrations of prednisone and prednisolone were determined by HPLC, and the binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was measured by radioisotopic and equilibrium dialysis techniques. The pharmacokinetics of both oral prednisone and intravenous prednisolone were dose-dependent. The mean oral dose plasma clearances of prednisone ranged from 572 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for the 5 mg dose to 2271 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for the 50 mg dose. Changes in prednisone half-life were insignificant, but increases in the half-life of its metabolite were dose-dependent. The systemic plasma clearance of i.v. prednisolone was dose-dependent and increased from 111 to 194 ml/min/1.73 m 2 over the 5 to 40 mg i.v. dosage range. The steady-state volume of distribution also increased, but little change in mean transit time and half-life was found. The binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was markedly concentration-dependent, and a two compartment, nonlinear equation was used to characterize the effective binding of prednisolone to transcortin and albumin. The apparent pharmacokinetic parameters of protein-free and transcortin-free prednisolone were relatively constant with dose. The interconversion of prednisone and prednisolone varied with time and dose, although prednisolone concentrations dominated by 4- to 10-fold over prednisone. In urine, 2-5% of either administered drug was excreted as prednisone and 11-24% as prednisolone. The apparent renal clearances of both steroids were also nonlinear and unrelated to protein binding. These studies indicate that the pharmacokinetics of prednisone and prednisolone are dose-dependent and that protein binding does not fully explain their apparent nonlinear distribution and disposition.","Six healthy male volunteers were given 5, 20, and 50 mg of oral prednisone (steroid medication given by mouth) and 5, 20, and 400 mg doses of intravenous, or IV, prednisolone (steroid medication delivered through the vein). Plasma (the liquid portion of blood) and urine concentrations of prednisone and prednisolone are determined by HPLC or high performance liquid chromatographic (a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze). How prednisolone attaches to proteins in plasma are also measured. The pharmacokinetics (how the body handles a drug) of both oral prednisone and IV prednisolone are dose-dependent (in which the effects of a drug change when the dose of the drug is changed). There are major changes in prednisone half-life (how long it takes for a drug concentration to be reduced to exactly half its initial amount in the blood), but increases in the half-life of its chemical changes by the body are dose-dependent. How the body clears IV prednisolone from plasma is dose-dependent. The steady-state volume (when how much the body is given of prednisolone is equal to how much of the drug the body eliminates) also increased, but little change in the average time and half-life is found. The binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was primarily based on the concentration or amount of the drug. The pharmacokinetic measures of prednisolone not attached to proteins or transcortin-free (free of a protein from the liver) are mostly constant with the dose provided. How prednisone and prednisolone can be exchanged for one another or converted to the other varies with time and dose, although the amount of prednisolone is greater than the amount of prednisone. The observed renal (kidney-related) elimination or removal of both steroid drugs are also nonlinear (increases in drug exposure are not directly related to increases in given doses) and unrelated to protein attachment. These studies suggest that how the body handles prednisone and prednisolone are dose-dependent and that attaching to proteins does not fully explain their apparent nonlinear distribution and how it is absorbed and excreted in the body.",
55,28441964,"Background: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is characterized by unexplained persistent fatigue, commonly accompanied by cognitive dysfunction, sleeping disturbances, orthostatic intolerance, fever, lymphadenopathy, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The extent to which the gastrointestinal microbiome and peripheral inflammation are associated with ME/CFS remains unclear. We pursued rigorous clinical characterization, fecal bacterial metagenomics, and plasma immune molecule analyses in 50 ME/CFS patients and 50 healthy controls frequency-matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic site, and season of sampling. Results: Topological analysis revealed associations between IBS co-morbidity, body mass index, fecal bacterial composition, and bacterial metabolic pathways but not plasma immune molecules. IBS co-morbidity was the strongest driving factor in the separation of topological networks based on bacterial profiles and metabolic pathways. Predictive selection models based on bacterial profiles supported findings from topological analyses indicating that ME/CFS subgroups, defined by IBS status, could be distinguished from control subjects with high predictive accuracy. Bacterial taxa predictive of ME/CFS patients with IBS were distinct from taxa associated with ME/CFS patients without IBS. Increased abundance of unclassified Alistipes and decreased Faecalibacterium emerged as the top biomarkers of ME/CFS with IBS; while increased unclassified Bacteroides abundance and decreased Bacteroides vulgatus were the top biomarkers of ME/CFS without IBS. Despite findings of differences in bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways defining ME/CFS subgroups, decreased metabolic pathways associated with unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and increased atrazine degradation pathways were independent of IBS co-morbidity. Increased vitamin B6 biosynthesis/salvage and pyrimidine ribonucleoside degradation were the top metabolic pathways in ME/CFS without IBS as well as in the total ME/CFS cohort. In ME/CFS subgroups, symptom severity measures including pain, fatigue, and reduced motivation were correlated with the abundance of distinct bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways. Conclusions: Independent of IBS, ME/CFS is associated with dysbiosis and distinct bacterial metabolic disturbances that may influence disease severity. However, our findings indicate that dysbiotic features that are uniquely ME/CFS-associated may be masked by disturbances arising from the high prevalence of IBS co-morbidity in ME/CFS. These insights may enable more accurate diagnosis and lead to insights that inform the development of specific therapeutic strategies in ME/CFS subgroups.","Background: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is characterized by unexplained persistent fatigue (long-lasting tiredness).

The extent to which the stomach microbiome (gut bacteria) and inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting) are associated (linked) with ME/CFS is unknown. This study evaluated 50 ME/CFS patients and 50 healthy controls. Analysis revealed associations between IBS co-morbidity, body mass index, fecal (poop) bacterial composition, and bacterial metabolic pathways. No associated was found between ME/CFS status and plasma (blood) immune molecules. IBS co-morbidity (co-diagnosis) was the most strongly associated endpoint with ME/CFS status.

20,19445546,"Pediatric generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about a variety of events and is accompanied by physical symptoms such as headaches, tension, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, and heart palpitations. Symptoms impose marked distress and interfere with social, emotional, and educational functioning. GAD occurs in over 10% of children and adolescents, has an average age of onset of 8.5 years, and is more often reported in girls. Common co-occurring conditions include separation anxiety disorder and social phobia. Assessment involves a multi-informant, multi-method approach involving the child, parents, and school teachers. A clinical interview should be conducted to assess for the three primary ways anxiety presents: behaviors, thoughts, and somatic symptoms. Several semi-structured diagnostic interviews are available, and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule is increasingly used. Rating scales completed by the patient, caregivers, and teachers provide useful information for diagnosis and symptom monitoring. Several scales are available to assess patients for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition) GAD diagnosis; however, instruments generally cannot distinguish children with GAD from children with similar anxiety disorders. Both cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders including GAD. Evidence suggests that the combination of CBT plus sertraline offers additional benefit compared with either treatment alone. With pharmacotherapy, systematic tracking of treatment-emergent adverse events such as headaches, stomach aches, behavioral activation, worsening symptoms, and emerging suicidal thoughts is important. Recommended starting doses are fluvoxamine 25 mg/day, fluoxetine 10 mg/day, and sertraline 25 mg/day, though lower starting doses are possible. Dosing can be adjusted as often as weekly with the goal of achieving a high-quality response, while minimizing side effects. Long-term treatment with medication has not been well studied; however, to achieve optimal long-term outcome extended use of medication may be required. It is recommended to continue medication for approximately 1 year following remission in symptoms, and when discontinuing medication to choose a stress-free time of the year. If symptoms return, medication re-initiation should be considered seriously.","In children, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) includes having more than normal and uncontrollable worry about different events and is also includes physical symptoms such as headaches, tension, restlessness, digestive problems, and a racing heartbeat.

A systematic literature review was performed to search for published cases of patients with confirmed pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency who underwent serial MRIs. Results: The 3 subjects in this series demonstrated clinical improvement on ketogenic diet. Two subjects showed reversal of some brain lesions on repeat MRI following initiation of ketogenic diet. Of the 21 published cases with serial MRIs, 13 patients underwent some form of treatment, and of this smaller subset 4 patients had repeat MRIs that showed definitive improvement. In both our described cases and those published in the literature, improvement occurred in lesions in the basal ganglia.

Previously, we showed that there is elevated Notch signaling compared to normal renal epithelial cells and that Notch signaling contributes to the proliferation of cystic cells. Quinomycin A, a bis-intercalator peptide, has previously been shown to target the Notch signaling pathway and inhibit tumor growth in cancer. Here, we show that Quinomycin A decreased cell proliferation and cyst growth of human ADPKD cyst epithelial cells cultured within a 3D collagen gel. Treatment with Quinomycin A reduced kidney weight to body weight ratio and decreased renal cystic area and fibrosis in Pkd1RC/RC ; Pkd2+/- mice, an orthologous PKD mouse model. This was accompanied by reduced expression of Notch pathway proteins, RBPjk and HeyL and cell proliferation in kidneys of PKD mice.

Previous studies show that, when compared to epithelial cells, there is an increase in cell signaling called Notch signaling that allows direct cell to cell communication. This Notch signaling contributes to the growth and division of cystic cells (cells that cluster together and form a cyst). Quinomycin A is a type of antibiotic (bacteria-fighting medication), has previously shown to target the Notch signaling process, and slow or stop tumor growth in cancer. In this study, researchers show that quinomycin A decreases cell development and cyst growth of cyst epithelial cells taken from humans with inherited PKD and analyzed in a lab. Treatment with quinomycin A reduces kidney weight to body weight ratio and decreases the size of the kidney cysts and the development of fibrous tissues that can impact the lungs. Also, there is a reduced number of proteins that develop from the Notch pathway. Quinomycin A treatments also normalized the length of cilia, hairlike vibrating structures found in large numbers on the surface of cyst epithelial cells.

16,1078546,"The mechanisms and kinetics of the immunosuppressive effects of alternate-day prednisone were investigated in a group of patients with a variety of inflammatory diseases receiving a range of alternate-day prednisone doses from 5 to 120 mg. Total circulating lymphocyte and monocyte counts, as well as proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations defined both by surface markers and by in vitro functional capacities, were studied. At 8 a. m. of the day on prednisone, just before drug administration, lymphocyte and monocyte counts, proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations, as well as in vitro lymphocyte blastogenic responses to various mitogenic and antigenic stimuli were normal. 4 h after the administration of prednisone, there was a profound lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia, with a differential depletion of thymus-derived lymphocytes as well as various functionally defined lymphocyte subpopulations. Lymphocyte kinetic studies using a radioactive chromium-labeled autologous lymphocytes showed that the lymphocytopenia was due predominantly to a transient depletion of the recirculating portion of the intravascular lymphocytepool. All these parameters returned to normal by 8 a.m. of the following day (off prednisone) and remained normal throughout the day. This very transient lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia after prednisone, with normal cell numbers, proportions, and functions throughout the remainder of the 2-day cycle, was associated with suppression of disease activity, yet did not affect cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity in these patients nor increase the likelihood of infectious complications. This drug-associated cyclic and transient monocytopenia and selective lymphocytopenia is best explained by a redistribution of recirculating lymphocytes to other body compartments, particularly the bone marrow.","The process and reactions of the immune system from taking alternate- or every-other-day prednisone (a type of steroid drug that works by lowering the activity of the immune system) are investigated in a group of patients with different inflammatory diseases (diseases in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues). Total circulating lymphocyte (the total number of white blood cells in body fluids) and number of monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria that enter the body), as well as lymphocyte subpopulations (parts of lymphocytes or white blood cells), were studied. At 8 a.m. of the day of receiving prednisone, just before the drug was given to patients, blood tests that include lymphocyte and monocyte counts and proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations were found to be normal. Four hours after receiving the prednisone, there is major lymphocytopenia (a condition where there is a lower-than-normal number of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, in the blood), monocytopenia (a reduction of monocytes, a type of immune cell, in the blood), reduction of T-cells (a type of immune cell that help protect the body from infection), and the presence of different lymphocyte subpopulations. Studies that focus on lymphocyte reactions showed that lymphocytopenia is due to short-term reduction of white blood cells circulating within and outside cells. All these blood measures returned to normal by 8 a.m. the next day (off the prednisone) and stayed normal throughout the day. The very short-term lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia after prednisone, with normal cell numbers and counts for the rest of the 2-day cycle, are connected with eliminating disease activity, yet did not affect cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity (showing a reaction in the skin after several days) and did not increase the chance of complications with infection. The short-term monocytopenia and lymphocytopenia connected with this drug is best explained as the body redistributing lymphocytes (white blood cells that are part of the immune system) to other parts of the body, particularly the bone marrow.",
35,26280231,"Osteoporosis-related fractures affect approximately one in two white women and one in five white men in their lifetime. The impact of fractures includes loss of function, significant costs, and increased mortality. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry to screen all women 65 years and older, and younger women who have an increased fracture risk as determined by the World Health Organization's FRAX Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. Although guidelines are lacking for rescreening women who have normal bone mineral density on initial screening, intervals of at least four years appear safe. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening for osteoporosis in men; other organizations recommend screening all men 70 years and older. In patients with newly diagnosed osteoporosis, suggested laboratory tests to identify secondary causes include serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, creatinine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. First-line treatment to prevent fractures consists of fall prevention, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake, and bisphosphonate therapy. Clinicians should consider discontinuing bisphosphonate therapy after five years in women without a personal history of vertebral fractures. Raloxifene, teriparatide, and denosumab are alternative effective treatments for certain subsets of patients and for those who are unable to take or whose condition does not respond to bisphosphonates. The need for follow-up bone mineral density testing in patients receiving treatment for osteoporosis is uncertain.","Bone breaks due to osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) happen in about 50% of white women and 20% of white men in their lifetime.

An expert panel recommends using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, or bone density scanning, to check all women 65 year and older, and younger women who are more likely to have bone breaks based on a popular measurement tool to measure fracture risk. Although there are not guidelines for rechecking women who have initial normal bone mineral density, four years between checks looks safe. The expert panel did not find enough proof to recommend checking for osteoporosis in men; other groups recommend checking all men 70 years and older. In people with newly found osteoporosis, lab tests to find underlying causes include measuring blood levels of different substances. The best treatment to prevent breaks includes preventing falls, stopping smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, and a group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning. Doctors should think about stopping a group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning after five years in women without a history of spine breaks. Other types of drugs for osteoporosis exist for certain groups of patients and for those who are unable to take or whose condition is not helped by one group of drugs that help prevent or slow down bone thinning. The need to recheck bone mineral density in people taking drugs for osteoporosis is unknown.",
37,30335626,"Background: Pregabalin has shown opioid sparing and analgesic effects in the early postoperative period; however, perioperative effects on cognition have not been studied. A randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled investigation in 80 donor nephrectomy patients was previously performed that evaluated the analgesic, opioid-sparing, and antihyperalgesic effects of pregabalin. This article describes a secondary exploratory analysis that tested the hypothesis that pregabalin would impair cognitive function compared to placebo. Methods: Eighty patients scheduled for donor nephrectomy participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled study. Pregabalin (150 mg twice daily, n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) was administered on the day of surgery and the first postoperative day, in addition to a pain regimen consisting of opioids, steroids, local anesthetics, and acetaminophen. Specific cognitive tests measuring inhibition, sustained attention, psychomotor speed, visual memory, and strategy were performed at baseline, 24 h, and 3 to 5 days after surgery, using tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Results: In the spatial working memory within errors test, the number of errors increased with pregabalin compared to placebo 24 h after surgery; median (25th, 75th percentile) values were 1 (0, 6) versus 0 (0, 1; rate ratio [95% CI], 3.20 [1.55 to 6.62]; P = 0.002). Furthermore, pregabalin significantly increased the number of errors in the stop-signal task stop-go test compared with placebo; median (25th, 75th percentile) values were 3 (1, 6) versus 1 (0, 2; rate ratio, 2.14 [1.13 to 4.07]; P = 0.020). There were no significant differences between groups in the paired associated learning, reaction time, rapid visual processing, or spatial working memory strategy tests. Conclusions: Perioperative pregabalin significantly negatively affected subdomains of executive functioning, including inhibition, and working memory compared to placebo, whereas psychomotor speed was not changed.","Pregabalin is a nerve pain medication.

A study in 80 patients that had one or both of their kidneys removed was previously conducted to evaluate the opioid-sparing, analgesic, and antihyperalgesic (reduction of pain sensitivity) effects of pregabalin. This paper describes a secondary investigation that tested if pregabalin would impair cognitive function when compared to a control (no treatment) group. Eighty patients scheduled for donor nephrectomy (removal of one or both kidneys) participated in this study. Pregabalin (150 mg twice daily) or placebo (a harmless pill) was administered (given) on the day of surgery and the first post-operation day. This was given in addition to a pain regimen consisting of opioids, steroids, local anesthetics, and acetaminophen (pain medication). Cognitive tests measuring inhibition (restraint), sustained attention, psychomotor (movement) speed, visual memory, and strategy were performed before, 24 h, and 3 to 5 days after surgery. The spatial working memory test is used to determine if a participant can recall the configuration of a series of images. During the test, the number of errors increased with pregabalin treatment compared to placebo 24 h after surgery. Furthermore, pregabalin significantly increased the number of errors in the stop-signal task stop-go test compared with placebo. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the paired associated learning, reaction time, rapid visual processing, or spatial working memory strategy tests. Perioperative (around surgery time) pregabalin significantly negatively affected several aspects of cognitive function when compared to placebo. However, psychomotor speed or movement was not changed.",
25,34552949,"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern show reduced neutralization by vaccine-induced and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies; therefore, treatment alternatives are needed. We tested therapeutic equine polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) that are being assessed in clinical trials in Costa Rica against five globally circulating variants of concern: alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma and delta, using plaque reduction neutralization assays. We show that equine pAbs efficiently neutralize the variants of concern, with inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.146-1.078 μg/mL, which correspond to extremely low concentrations when compared to pAbs doses used in clinical trials. Equine pAbs are an effective, broad coverage, low-cost and a scalable COVID-19 treatment.","Coronavirus variants of concern (variants that are easier to transmit and/or are more severe) show reduced effect from monoclonal antibodies which are drugs that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 (a viral breathing-related disorder) from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. Researchers tested equine or horse-derived polyclonal antibodies (antibody drugs that attack several parts of the COVID-19 virus) that are being tested in clinical trials in Costa Rica against five globally circulating variants of concern: alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma and delta. The results show that equine polyclonal antibodies efficiently make the variant of concern ineffective. Equine polyclonal antibodies are found to be an effective, low-cost, and accessible COVID-19 treatment for the variants of concern.","Alarming variants of SARS-CoV-2 (a viral respiratory disease) show reduced elimination by vaccine-induced and highly-specific antibodies. Thus, different treatments are needed. We tested horse-derived polyclonal antibodies (pAbs), a mixture of antibodies that bind to the same foreign organism.

Horse-derived pAbs efficiently treat the concerning variants with much lower dosages than those used in clinical trials. Horse-derived pAbs are an effective, broad coverage, low-cost treatment for COVID-19 (a widespread viral respiratory disease)."
26,33049331,"Objectives: To summarise the evidence on the duration of infectiousness of individuals in whom SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid is detected. Methods: A rapid review was undertaken in PubMed, Europe PubMed Central and EMBASE from 1 January 2020 to 26 August 2020. Results: We identified 15 relevant studies, including 13 virus culture studies and 2 contact tracing studies. For 5 virus culture studies, the last day on which SARS-CoV-2 was isolated occurred within 10 days of symptom onset. For another 5 studies, SARS-CoV-2 was isolated beyond day 10 for approximately 3% of included patients. The remaining 3 virus culture studies included patients with severe or critical disease; SARS-CoV-2 was isolated up to day 32 in one study. Two studies identified immunocompromised patients from whom SARS-CoV-2 was isolated for up to 20 days. Both contact tracing studies, when close contacts were first exposed greater than 5 days after symptom onset in the index case, found no evidence of laboratory-confirmed onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients with mild-to-moderate illness are highly unlikely to be infectious beyond 10 days of symptoms. However, evidence from a limited number of studies indicates that patients with severe-to-critical illness or who are immunocompromised, may shed infectious virus for longer.","The goal of this paper was to summarize scientific reports detailing the amount of time someone positive for (or with) COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) can infect others. To do this, the authors reviewed papers published in public databases (e.g. PubMed, Europe PubMed Central, EMBASE) between the dates of January 1, 2020 to August 26, 2020. Fifteen studies were identified for review. Thirteen reports focused on COVID-19 that was grown within a laboratory (in culture) from human biological sampling. Two studies followed contact tracing between humans. For 5 viral culture studies, the last day that COVID-19 was able to be identified in biological samples was 10 days before symptoms occurred. For another 5 culture studies, COVID-19 was identified in biological samples past day 10. The remaining 3 virus culture studies evaluated patients with severe or critical COVID-19 illness. COVID-19 was isolated up to 32 days in one of these studies. Two studies identified immunocompromised patients (patients with decreased immune function) from whom COIVD-19 was able to be isolated from for up to 20 days. For both contact tracing or spreading studies, when exposure occurred more than five days after symptoms were apparent, there was no evidence of COVID-19 spreading. The authors concluded that COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms are unlikely to spread the virus to others beyond 10 days of symptoms. However, studies have shown that patients with severe to critical symptoms, or those who are immunocompromised, may spread the virus for longer periods of time.",
38,28631809,"Background: Pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores, pressure sores or decubitus ulcers develop as a result of a localised injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both. The ulcers usually arise over a bony prominence, and are recognised as a common medical problem affecting people confined to a bed or wheelchair for long periods of time. Anabolic steroids are used as off-label drugs (drugs which are used without regulatory approval) and have been used as adjuvants to usual treatment with dressings, debridement, nutritional supplements, systemic antibiotics and antiseptics, which are considered to be supportive in healing of pressure ulcers. Anabolic steroids are considered because of their ability to stimulate protein synthesis and build muscle mass. Comprehensive evidence is required to facilitate decision making, regarding the benefits and harms of using anabolic steroids. Objectives: To assess the effects of anabolic steroids for treating pressure ulcers. Main results: The review contains only one trial with a total of 212 participants, all with spinal cord injury and open pressure ulcers classed as stage III and IV. The participants were mainly male (98.2%, 106/108) with a mean age of 58.4 (standard deviation 10.4) years in the oxandrolone group and were all male (100%, 104/104) with a mean age of 57.3 (standard deviation 11.6) years in the placebo group. This trial compared oxandrolone (20 mg/day, administered orally) with a dose of placebo (an inactive substance consisting of 98% starch and 2% magnesium stearate) and reported data on complete healing of ulcers and adverse events. There was very low-certainty evidence on the relative effect of oxandrolone on complete ulcer healing at the end of a 24-week treatment period (risk ratio RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.26) (downgraded twice for imprecision due to an extremely wide 95% CI, which spanned both benefit and harm, and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients). Thus, we are uncertain whether oxandrolone improves or reduces the complete healing of pressure ulcers, as we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. There was low-certainty evidence on the risk of non-serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo (RR 3.85, 95% CI 1.12 to 13.26) (downgraded once for imprecision and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients). Thus, the treatment with oxandrolone may increase the risk of non-serious adverse events reported in participants. There was very low-certainty evidence on the risk of serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.17) (downgraded twice for imprecision due to an extremely wide 95% CI, which spanned both benefit and harm, and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients). Of the five serious adverse events reported in the oxandrolone-treated group, none were classed by the trial teams as being related to treatment. We are uncertain whether oxandrolone increases or decreases the risk of serious adverse events as we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. Secondary outcomes such as pain, length of hospital stay, change in wound size or wound surface area, incidence of different type of infection, cost of treatment and quality of life were not reported in the included trial. Overall the evidence in this study was of very low quality (downgraded for imprecision and indirectness). This trial stopped early when the futility analysis (interim analysis) in the opinion of the study authors showed that oxandrolone had no benefit over placebo for improving ulcer healing. Authors' conclusions: There is no high quality evidence to support the use of anabolic steroids in treating pressure ulcers. Further well-designed, multicenter trials, at low risk of bias, are necessary to assess the effect of anabolic steroids on treating pressure ulcers, but careful consideration of the current trial and its early termination are required when planning future research.","Pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores, pressure sores, or decubitus ulcers develop because of a localized (regionalized) injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both. The ulcers usually occur in a bony area of the body. Ulcers are recognized as a common medical problem affecting people confined to a bed or wheelchair for long periods of time. Anabolic (muscle building) steroids are used as off-label drugs. This means they are often used without doctor approval. They have been used to increase healing alongside usual treatment with dressings, debridement (removal of damaged tissue from a wound), nutritional supplements, systemic antibiotics (full-body medicines that fight infection) and antiseptics (antimicrobial skin medication).

There was very low-certainty evidence on the relative effect of oxandrolone on complete ulcer healing at the end of a 24-week treatment period. Therefore, it is unclear if oxandrolone improves or reduces the complete healing of pressure ulcers. There was low-certainty evidence on the risk of non-serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo. Treatment with oxandrolone may increase the risk of non-serious negative side events reported in participants.

Five serious adverse events were reported in the oxandrolone-treated group. However, none were classed by the trial teams as being related to treatment.

Secondary outcomes include pain, length of hospital stay, change in wound size or wound surface area, incidence of different type of infection, cost of treatment, and quality of life. Overall the evidence in this study was of very low quality. This is due to lack of precision (low confidence in results) and indirectness (only males were evaluated) in data. The trial was stopped early when deeper investigation showed that oxandrolone had no benefit over the placebo for improving ulcer healing. The authors concluded there is no high quality evidence to support the use of anabolic steroids in treating pressure ulcers.

32,18200034,"Recent studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs like diuretics increase plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels. However, the effect of other antihypertensive drugs on plasma Hcy levels has not been tested extensively. The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of antihypertensive therapy (AHT) on Hcy levels in essential hypertensive subjects. A case-control study of 273 patients with essential hypertension (EH) and 103 normotensive controls was undertaken. Plasma Hcy levels were measured before and after 6 weeks of AHT. The genotyping of MTHFR C677T polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers significantly decreased and hydrochlorothiazides significantly increased the plasma Hcy levels in hypertensive patients (P<0.05). No significant association between MTHFR C677T genotypes and changes in Hcy levels in response to antihypertensive was observed in EH patients. The decrease in Hcy induced by beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors observed in our study may be due to the improvement of endothelial function along with improved renal function. Thus, our results suggest that ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may provide additional beneficial therapeutic effects to the EH patients by decreasing Hcy levels.","Recent studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs (that treat high blood pressure), like diuretics, increase plasma or blood homocysteine (Hcy) levels. Hcy is am amino acid that creates other chemicals your body needs. However, the effect of other antihypertensive drugs on plasma Hcy levels has not been tested extensively. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of antihypertensive therapy (AHT) on Hcy levels in essential hypertensive subjects. Essential hypertensive patients have high blood pressure that is not the result of a medical condition. A study of 273 patients with essential hypertension (EH) and 103 patients with normal blood pressure was begun. Plasma Hcy levels were measured before and after 6 weeks of AHT. Patients were genotyped to analyze a specific genetic variation or gene material. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are drugs that lower blood pressure by relaxing veins and arteries. Beta-blockers are drugs that lower blood pressure by blocking the effects of adrenaline. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers significantly decrease plasms Hcy levels in hypertensive patients. Hydrochlorothiazides, or ""water pills"", significantly increase plasms Hcy levels in hypertensive patients. There was no association between the identified genetic variation and changes in Hcy levels in response to antihypertensive within EH patients. The observed decrease in Hcy caused by ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may be due to the improvement of endothelial (tissue lining various organs and cavities in the body) and kidney function. Therefore, this study suggests that ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may provide additional, beneficial or therapeutic effects to the EH patients by decreasing Hcy levels.",

Although previous studies have demonstrated that SLE is related to the imbalance of cells in the immune system, including B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells, etc., the mechanisms underlying SLE pathogenesis remain unclear.

52,30779428,"X-chromosome inactivation generally results in dosage equivalence for expression of X-linked genes between 46,XY males and 46,XX females. The 20-30% of genes that escape silencing are thus candidates for having a role in the phenotype of Turner syndrome. Understanding which genes escape from silencing, and how they avoid this chromosome-wide inactivation is therefore an important step toward understanding Turner Syndrome. We have examined the mechanism of escape using a previously reported knock-in of a BAC containing the human escape gene RPS4X in mouse. We now demonstrate that escape from inactivation for RPS4X is already established by embryonic Day 9.5, and that both silencing and escape are faithfully maintained across the lifespan. No overt abnormalities were observed for transgenic mice up to 1 year of age despite robust transcription of the human RPS4X gene with no detectable downregulation of the mouse homolog. However, there was no significant increase in protein levels, suggesting translational compensation in the mouse. Finally, while many of the protein-coding genes have been assessed for their inactivation status, less is known about the X-linked RNA genes, and we propose that for many microRNA genes their inactivation status can be predicted as they are intronic to genes for which the inactivation status is known.","X-chromosome inactivation generally results in gene expression equivalence of X-linked genes between 46,XY males and 46,XX females.

20,1378369,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a recently developed class of drugs with significantly greater antidepressant efficacy than placebo. Generally, in double-blind comparative trials, all SSRIs demonstrated antidepressant efficacy similar to that of the 'standard' tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and imipramine; a meta-analysis of controlled trials found the efficacy of the SSRIs to be equivalent to that of the 2 tricyclics. Nevertheless, because of small patient numbers included in most studies that compare SSRIs with other antidepressants, no definitive statements about relative efficacy can be made. In these studies it is simply possible to state that no statistically significant differences were identified between SSRIs and the comparative antidepressants. Importantly, differences in clinical characteristics exist between the SSRIs-differences in elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) between fluoxetine and/or its metabolite (total t1/2 beta = 330 hours) and other SSRIs (t1/2 beta range = 15 to 30 hours), for example. This has implications in terms of potential drug interactions and must be considered when patients have to be switched to treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Studies with fluvoxamine have been conducted in both in- and outpatients, whereas trials with other SSRIs have been confined largely to outpatient populations. Fluvoxamine has been associated with a high incidence of nausea (37%), although this may have resulted from high initial dosages (rather than upward dose titration protocols) used in early trials. Of further interest, fluoxetine doses of 20mg may be sufficient to produce a satisfactory antidepressant response, and this SSRI may be particularly useful in patients with chronic retarded depression. More clinical data are required before the efficacy of sertraline and citalopram relative to standard antidepressants can be clearly defined. Preliminary data indicate that SSRIs are effective in the treatment of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating (e.g. anorexia and bulimia) and personality disorders (e.g. anger, impulsiveness) and substance abuse (e.g. alcoholism); early results with fluvoxamine in the treatment of panic disorder and OCD, and with fluoxetine in the treatment of bulimia, personality disorders and alcohol abuse, have been encouraging. SSRIs have a more favourable tolerability profile than tricyclic antidepressants and, unlike the tricyclics, are not associated with anticholinergic adverse effects, sedation, cardiotoxicity or weight gain. SSRIs are associated with a relatively high incidence of nausea, particularly if high doses are used at the start of treatment. However, the incidence of nausea appears to decrease as treatment is continued.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which increase serotonin, are recent, notable antidepressant drugs. SSRIs show similar success to other common antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine. Still, since the studies have small patient samples, no definite statements about the relative antidepressant success of SSRIs can be made. In these studies, no difference was identified between SSRIs and other antidepressants. Importantly, SSRIs have differences like effect duration among other antidepressant medications like fluoxetine. This distinct effect duration may alter the drug's success and should be considered when switching patients' treatments. Studies with fluvoxamine (an antidepressant SSRI) occured with patients in and out of hospitals, while studies with other SSRIs occured largely with patients out of hospitals. Using fluvoxamine (an antidepressant drug) may lead to nausea, but this may be due to using high starting doses rather than steadily-increasing dosages for use in early trials. 20 mg of flueoxetine may give a decent antidepressant response and be useful for those with long-lasting, movement-inhibiting depression. More data is needed to define the success of other antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like sertraline and citalopram. SSRIs like fluvoxamine and fluoxetine seem to help treat a variety of mental illnesses other than depression. Patients put up with SSRIs better than other non-SSRI antidepressants and without notable side effects, sleepiness, heart damage, or weight gain. SSRIs can lead to nausea, especially with high starting doses. However, the frequency of nausea may decrease as treatment continues.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a recently developed type of drugs that works better as an antidepressant than a placebo, a type of substance that looks like a real pill but is not the real medicine. In clinical studies, all SSRIs showed that they have similar effectiveness as standard antidepressants that are older types of medicines. However, because of the small patient numbers in most studies that compare SSRIs with other antidepressants, no definite statements on how the effectiveness compares between the two types of drugs can be made. In these studies, it is simply possible to state that no significant differences based on data analysis are identified between SSRIs and the other type of antidepressants they are being compared to. Importantly, differences in medical features and measures exist between the SSRIs, including differences in the time it takes for the amount of the drug in the body to be reduced to half its starting amount between fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) and other SSRIs. The findings from these existing studies may lead to other effects, including how two or more drugs react to one another which must be considered when patients are switched to treatment with an earlier antidepressant. The structure of clinical studies differs between fluvoxamine, which includes inpatients and outpatients, and other SSRIs which mainly take place in outpatient settings. Fluvoxamine is associated with a high frequency of nausea (37%), although this may be the result from patients starting with a high dose that are often used in early trials instead of the standard dose. Additionally, fluoxetine doses of 20mg may be enough to produce a satisfactory antidepressant response, and this SSRI may be particularly useful in patients with chronic retarded depression, a depression disorder where symptoms include slow movement and toneless speech. More clinical data are needed before the effectiveness of sertraline and citalopram (two other SSRIs) relative to standard antidepressants can be clearly defined. Early data suggests that SSRIs are effective in the treatment of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating (e.g. anorexia and bulimia) and personality disorders (e.g. anger, impulsiveness) and substance abuse (e.g. alcoholism). There are encouraging early results with fluvoxamine in the treatment of panic disorder and OCD, and with fluoxetine in the treatment of bulimia, personality disorders and alcohol abuse. Patients are able to handle the side effects of SSRIs better than tricyclic antidepressants and, unlike the tricyclics, SSRIs are not associated with adverse effects of anticholinergic drugs that treat a number of health problems, sedation, damage to the heart, or weight gain. SSRIs are associated with a high count of nausea, particularly if high doses are used at the start of treatment. However, the frequency of nausea appears to decrease as treatment is continued."

13,20208092,"Circadian variation in atrial fibrillation (AF) frequency is explored in this paper by employing recent advances in signal processing. Once the AF frequency has been estimated and tracked by a hidden Markov model approach, the resulting trend is analyzed for the purpose of detecting and characterizing the presence of circadian variation. With cosinor analysis, the results show that the short-term variations in the AF frequency exceed the variation that may be attributed to circadian. Using the autocorrelation method, circadian variation was found in 13 of 18 ambulatory ECG recordings (Holter) acquired from patients with long-standing persistent AF. Using the ensemble correlation method, the highest AF frequency usually occurred during the afternoon, whereas the lowest usually occurred during late night. It is concluded that circadian variation is present in most patients with long-standing persistent AF though the short-term variation in the AF frequency is considerable and should be taken into account.","Sleep-wake changes in the frequency of atrial fibrillation (irregular or rapid heart beat) (AF) is explored by using new advances in signal processing.

With mathematical analysis, sleep-wake changes were found in 13 of 18 ambulatory heart-beat recordings from those with long-lasting frequencies of irregular heart beats. With mathematical analysis, the highest frequency of an irregular heart beat usually came in the afternoon, while the lowest usually came at late night. Thus, sleep-wake changes occur in most with long-lasting AF frequency. However, the short-term changes in AF frequency should be examined.","Circadian variation (a part of the natural, internal process that regulates the sleep–wake cycle) in atrial fibrillation (a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots or stroke) frequency is explored in this paper by using recent advances in signal processing, which monitors the heart's electrical activity. When the atrial fibrillation frequency is estimated and tracked by signal processing tools, the information is further reviewed to detect and describe the presence of circadian variation. The results show that the short-term variations in the atrial fibrillation frequency are greater than the variation that may be attributed to circadian. Circadian variation is found in 13 of 18 patients with long-standing and persistent (last longer than 7 days) atrial fibrillation. The highest atrial fibrillation frequency usually occurred during the afternoon, whereas the lowest usually occurred during late night. Circadian variation is present in most patients with long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation, though the short-term variation in the AF frequency is great and should be taken into account."
30,34206895,"The number of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 has skyrocketed in the past year. Concerns have been raised regarding their performance characteristics, depending on the disease severity and the time of the analysis post-symptom onset (PSO). Thus, independent validations using an unbiased sample selection are required for meaningful serology data interpretation. We aimed to assess the clinical performance of six commercially available assays, the seroconversion, and the dynamics of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study included 528 serum samples from 156 patients with follow-up visits up to six months PSO and 161 serum samples from healthy people. The IgG/total antibodies positive percentage increased and remained above 95% after six months when chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) IgG antiS1/S2 and electro-chemiluminescent assay (ECLIA) total antiNP were used. At early time points PSO, chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) IgM antiS achieved the best sensitivity. IgM and IgG appear simultaneously in most circumstances, and when performed in parallel the sensitivity increases. The severe and the moderate clinical forms were significantly associated with higher seropositivity percentage and antibody levels. High specificity was found in all evaluated assays, but the sensitivity was variable depending on the time PSO, severity of disease, detection method and targeted antigen.","The number of blood tests that check for antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) for the coronavirus (which causes COVID-19, the lung infection) has skyrocketed in the past year. Concerns have been raised on the performance of the tests, depending on the disease severity and the time of the test after symptoms start. Therefore, confirming the performance of the test using an unbiased sample is required in order to understand and describe the antibody data. Researchers aim to assess the performance of six available blood tests, the seroconversion (when the body starts producing antibodies), and how the body creates antibodies in response to coronavirus infection. The study included 528 blood samples from 156 patients with follow-up visits up to 6 months after the start of symptoms and 161 blood samples from healthy people. The total amount of antibodies increased and remained above 95% after six months when using certain tests to identify antibodies. At early times after the start of symptoms, a blood test that looks for certain antibodies that suggest recent infection has the best ability to correctly diagnose a positive (or virus-containing) case. Two types of antibodies, IgM and IgG, appear at the same time in most circumstances, and when performed together, the ability to correctly diagnose a positive diagnosis increases. The severe and the moderate clinical forms have major associations with a higher number of positive tests and antibody levels. The ability to correctly have a negative (or no virus) test among negative people is found in all evaluated blood tests, but the ability to correctly diagnose a true positive varies depending on the time after the start of symptoms and the type of test.",
10,30328699,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by pain, functional disability, poor quality of life (QoL), high socioeconomic impact, and annual costs of over $56 billion in the United States. Acupuncture (AC) is widely in use; however, studies show severe methodological shortcomings, did not consider the functional diagnosis for the allocation of acupoints and their results showed no differences between verum and control groups. Objective: The authors aimed to objectively assess the safety and efficacy of AC treatments for RA. Methods: 105 RA patients with a functional diagnosis of a ""Pivot syndrome"" or ""Turning Point syndrome"" were randomly assigned to (1) verum-AC (verum acupoints), (2) control-AC (sham acupoints-points outside of the conduits/meridians and of the extra-conduits), or (3) waiting list (each group n = 35). AC groups experienced the exact same number, depth, and stimulation of needles. Assessments took place before and 5 min after AC with follow-ups over 4 weeks. Results: (1) Verum-AC significantly improved self-reported pain (Z = -5.099, p < 0.001) and pressure algometry (Z = -5.086, p < 0.001); hand grip strength (Z = -5.086, p < 0.001) and arm strength (Z = -5.086, p < 0.001); health status improved significantly (p < 0.001, Z = -4.895); QoL improved significantly in 7/8 survey domains; and number of swollen joints (Z = -2.862, p = 0.004) and tender joints (Z = -3.986, p < 0.001) significantly decreased. (2) Control-AC showed no significant changes, except in self-reported pain improvement. (3) Waiting list group showed an overall worsening. Conclusion: This is the first double-blind controlled study on AC in RA of the hand that objectively and specifically assesses positive effects supporting its integration in rheumatology. Acupoint allocation according to Chinese Medicine functional diagnoses is extremely relevant to assess AC effectiveness in a patient group primarily defined by a ""western"" medicine diagnosis. Based on clear allocation criteria for acupoints, the authors minimized the possible bias of unspecific and suggestive effects on the control group, showed the specific effects of the points chosen, improved efficacy, and identified an evidence base for AC.","Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the body by mistake. It can cause pain, decrease movement, lead to poor quality of life, impact the social and economic parts of communities, and cost over $56 billion in the United States every year. Acupuncture involves pricking the skin or tissues with thin needles at key points in the body to reduce pain and is widely used. However, studies show problems in the methods used to measure acupuncture. The aim of this current study is to evaluate the safety and the performance of acupuncture treatments on rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, 105 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and a specific diagnosis were randomly assigned to either the acupuncture group, the sham acupuncture group (where the patient is pricked with thin needles but at different, less key points of the body), or a waiting list group. Each group had 35 patients. The acupuncture groups (both normal and sham) experienced the exact same number, depth, and stimulation of needles. A physical and visual exam of patients took place before and 5 minutes after acupuncture treatment with follow-up visits over 4 weeks. Patients in the acupuncture group showed signficantly improved pain and pain sensitivity, hand grip and arm strength, as well as improved health status. Quality of life significantly improved in 7 out of 8 parts of a survey. The number of swollen joints and tender joints signficantly decreased. In the sham acupuncture group (the group that received needle pricks but outside the key points of the body) did not have any significant changes in their condition except in pain improvement. The waiting list group showed an overall worsening. This is the first double-blind controlled study (where neither the patients nor the researcher knows which treatment participants are getting) on acupuncture for rheumatoid arthritis of the hand. The study shows positive effects supporting acupuncture's inclusion in other treatments for rheumatology (diseases in the joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments). The site of the acupuncture needle is very important to determine acupuncture effectiveness. Because the authors in this study clearly defined the placement of the acupuncture needles on the body, they reduced possible bias, showed how the placement of the needles affects the body, improved performance of acupuncture, and identified evidence to support use of acupuncture.",
48,34528084,"Objectives: To characterize the relationship of anifrolumab pharmacokinetics with efficacy and safety in patients with moderate to severe SLE despite standard therapy, using pooled data from 2 phase 3 trials. Methods: TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 were randomized, placebo-controlled, 52-week trials of intravenous anifrolumab (every 4 weeks for 48 weeks). For the exposure-response analysis, BILAG-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) or SLE Responder Index (SRI[4]) response rates at week 52 in each quartile/tertile of average anifrolumab serum concentration (Cave) were compared for anifrolumab and placebo in all-comers, patients who completed treatment, and interferon gene signature (IFNGS)-high patients who completed treatment, using average marginal effect logistic regression. Relationships between exposure and key safety events were assessed graphically. Results: Of patients in TULIP-1/TULIP-2 who received anifrolumab (150 mg [n = 91], 300 mg [n = 356]) or placebo (n = 366), 574 completed treatment, of whom 470 were IFNGS high. In the exposure-efficacy analyses, BICLA and SRI(4) treatment differences favoring anifrolumab 300 mg vs placebo were observed across Cave subgroups and all analysis populations. Logistic regression identified Cave as a significant covariate for predicted BICLA response, as higher anifrolumab Cave predicted greater efficacy. There was no evidence of exposure-driven incidence of key safety events through week 52 in patients receiving anifrolumab 150 or 300 mg. Conclusion: While higher Cave predicted greater efficacy, consistent positive benefit favouring anifrolumab 300 mg vs placebo was observed in BICLA and SRI(4) responses across Cave subgroups in the TULIP trials. There was no evidence of exposure-driven safety events.","The objective of this study is to describe the relationship of how the drug called anifrolumab works with the effectiveness and safety in patients who have moderate to severe lupus (when your immune system attacks healthy cells) despite receiving standard therapy. The study uses data gathered from clinical study trials. TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 are 52-week clinical trials of anifrolumab given through a vein every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. Anifrolumab and placebo are compared using different assessment tools and analyses. Relationships between exposure to the medication and key safety events are assessed graphically. Of patients in TULIP-1/TULIP-2 who received anifrolumab (a total of 447 patients receiving a dose amount of 150 or 300mg) or sham treatment/placebo (366 patients), 574 patients completed treatment. In the exposure-effectiveness analyses, treatment differences favoring anifrolumab (at 300) vs placebo are observed across subgroups of the study participants and all analysis populations. The concentration of the drug is found to be a significant factor for having a response, as higher anifrolumab in blood predicted greater effectiveness. There is no evidence of key safety events from taking the drug through week 52 in patients receiving anifrolumab 150 or 300 mg. In conclusion, while higher concentration of the drug in blood predicted greater effectiveness, ongoing positive benefits of anifrolumab 300 mg vs placebo is observed across subgroups in the TULIP trials. There is no evidence of safety events from exposure to the drug.","Using data from clinical trials, the study aimed to describe how anifrolumab, an immunosuppressive drug, operates effectively and safely in patients with moderate to severe full-body or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an inflammatory disease in which immune cells mistakely attack joints, skin, brain cells and more, under standard treatment. We analyzed two randomized, 52-week trials, called TULIP-1 and TULIP-2, which involved injected anifrolumab treatment (every 4 weeks for 48 weeks). To track patient health, we used specific assessments along with measurements of average anifrolumab blood concetration (Cave) to compare anifrolumab-treated patients, sham-treatment patients, patients who completed treatment, and patients with increased immune-specific genetic markers. Trends between health and key safety events were assessed graphically. Of patients in TULIP-1/TULIP-2 who got anifrolumab (91 received 150 mg, 356 received 300 mg) or sham treatment (366 patients), 574 completed treatment, of whom 470 had high levels of immune-specific molecules. Patient health favored anifrolumab 300 mg vs dummy treatment across all analuzed populations. Higher anifrolumab levels were linked to greater treatment success. There was no evidence of treatment-related safety events through week 52 in patients receiving anifrolumab 150 or 300 mg. Whil higher anifrolumab levels predicted greater success, consistent positive benefit favouring anifrolumab 300 mg vs dummy treatment was seen across assessments in subgroups of the TULIP trials. There was no evidence of treatment-related safety events."
31,29795977,"Aim: The aim of this study was to summarize the characteristics, efficacy, and safety of vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) inhibitors for treating tardive dyskinesia (TD). Materials and methods: We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Database, and ClinicalTrials.gov, screening for systematic reviews, meta-analyses or double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (DBRPCTs) reporting efficacy or safety data of VMAT-2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine) in patients with TD. A random effects meta-analysis of efficacy and safety data from DBRPCTs was performed. Results: Two acute, 12-week DBRPCTs with deutetrabenazine 12-48 mg/day (n=413) and 4 acute, 4-6-week double-blind trials with valbenazine 12.5-100 mg/day (n=488) were meta-analyzable, without meta-analyzable, high-quality data for tetrabenazine. Regarding reduction in total Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores (primary outcome), both deutetrabenazine (k=2, n=413, standardized mean difference [SMD] =-0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] =-0.19, -0.62, p<0.001; weighted mean difference (WMD) =-1.44, 95% CI =-0.67, -2.19, p<0.001) and valbenazine (k=4, n=421, SMD =-0.58, 95% CI =-0.26, -0.91, p<0.001; WMD =-2.07, 95% CI =-1.08, -3.05, p<0.001) significantly outperformed placebo. Results were confirmed regarding responder rates (≥50% AIMS total score reduction; deutetrabenazine: risk ratio [RR] =2.13, 95% CI =1.10, 4.12, p=0.024, number-needed-to-treat [NNT] =7, 95% CI =3, 333, p=0.046; valbenazine: RR =3.05, 95% CI =1.81, 5.11, p<0.001, NNT =4, 95% CI =3, 6, p<0.001). Less consistent results emerged from patient-rated global impression-based response (p=0.15) and clinical global impression for deutetrabenazine (p=0.088), and for clinical global impression change for valbenazine (p=0.67). In an open-label extension (OLE) study of deutetrabenazine (≤54 weeks) and a dose-blinded valbenazine study (≤48 weeks), responder rates increased over time. With valbenazine, discontinuation effects were studied, showing TD symptom recurrence towards baseline severity levels within 4 weeks after valbenazine withdrawal. No increased cumulative or specific adverse (AEs) events versus placebo (acute trials) in extension versus acute trial data were observed. Conclusion: The 2 VMAT-2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, are effective in treating TD, both acutely and long-term, without concerns about increased risk of depression or suicide in the TD population. No head-to-head comparison among VMAT-2 inhibitors and no high-quality, meta-analyzable data are available for tetrabenazine in patients with TD.","This study's aim was to summarize the characteristics, effect, and safety of vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) inhibitors, drugs that treat movement disorders, for treating tardive dyskinesia (TD), a movement disorder of irregular, jerking movements. We searched online for studies reporting the effect and safety of VMAT-2 inhibitors like tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine in patients with TD. Two short, 12-week studies with deutetrabenazine12-48 mg/day (with 413 patients) and 4 short, 4-6-week studies with valbenazine 12.5-100 mg/day (with 488 patients) were analyzed. There was no high-quality data for tetrabenazine. Regarding reducing irregular, involuntary movements (the primary symptom), both deutetrabenazine and valbenazine outperformed placebo or a dummy treatment. Results were confirmed regarding responder rates, or the proportion of patients with a reduction in symptoms in a define period of time. Patient-rated global impressions for deutetrabenazine and clinical global impressions for deutetrabenazine and valbenazine were less strong. In a long-term study of deutetrabenazine (≤54 weeks) and a valbenazine study (≤48 weeks), responder rates increased. With valbenazine, drug use stoppage effects were studied, showing TD symptom reappearance of initial severity 4 weeks after valbenazine stoppage. No increased or specific, serious or adverse events (AEs) versus dummy treatment (acute trials) in long-term versus short-term trials were seen. The 2 VMAT-2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, can treat TD, both short- and long-term, without concerns about increased risk of depression or suicide in the TD population. No direct comparison between the VMAT-2 inhibitors and no high-quality data are available for tetrabenazine in patients with TD.","We aimed to summarize the characteristics, how well it works, and safety of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT-2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), for treating tardive dyskinesia (TD) - a movement disorder. We searched for published scientific studies, including studies that summarized other studies, used statistics to combine results from other studies, or randomly assigned participants to groups receiving TD treatment or sugar pills that looked at how well treatments worked and safety of VMAT-2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine) in patients with TD. We used statistical methods to determine how well treatments work and safety results across multiple studies. We used statistical methods to combine results from two 12-week studies with deutetrabenazine 12-48 mg/day (413 patients) and four 4-6 week studies with valbenazine 12.5-100 mg/day (488 patients). No high-quality data were available for tetrabenazine for a similar analysis. Results favored deutetrabenazine and valbenazine over sugar pills in scores on a rating scale that measures involuntary movements (AIMS). The percentage of patients who had 50% reduction in scores on the same rating scale (AIMS) favored deutetrabenazine and valbenazine over sugar pills. Results were less consistent using another rating scale done by patients and doctors for deutetrabenazine and by doctors for valbenazine. In one study of deutetrabenazine and one study of valbenazine, the percentage of patients who had a 50% reduction in scores on the AIMS rating scale went up over time. Effects of stopping valbenazine were studied, showing TD symptoms returning to levels before stopping valbenazine within 4 weeks of stopping the drug. No increased unfavorable and unintended effects were observed in studies where participants continued to take the studied drug compared to sugar pills. We conclude that the 2 VMAT-2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, work to treat TD, both in the short- and long-term, without causing increased risk of depression or suicide in people with TD. No studies comparing VMAT-2 inhibitors or high-quality tetrabenazine data that could be compared across studies were available."
24,11097963,"Objective: Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (N=107) who had been long-term benzodiazepine users (average duration of use=8.5 years) were enrolled in a benzodiazepine discontinuation program that assessed the effectiveness of concomitant imipramine (180 mg/day) and buspirone (38 mg/day) compared to placebo in facilitating benzodiazepine discontinuation. Method: After a benzodiazepine stabilization period taking either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam, patients were treated for 4 weeks with imipramine, buspirone, or placebo under double-blind conditions while benzodiazepine intake was kept stable (treatment phase). Patients then entered a 4-6 week benzodiazepine taper and a 5-week posttaper phase with imipramine, buspirone, and placebo treatment being continued until 3 weeks into the posttaper phase, at which time all patients were switched to placebo for 2 weeks. Benzodiazepine plasma levels were assayed weekly. Benzodiazepine-free status was assessed 3 and 12 months posttaper. Results: Study subjects were long-term benzodiazepine users with an average of three unsuccessful prior taper attempts. The success rate of the taper in this study was significantly higher for patients who received imipramine (82.6%), and nonsignificantly higher for patients who received buspirone (67.9%), than for patients who received placebo (37.5%). The imipramine effect remained highly significant even after the analysis adjusted for three other independent predictors of taper success: benzodiazepine dose, level of anxious symptoms at baseline, and duration of benzodiazepine therapy. Conclusions: Management of benzodiazepine discontinuation can be facilitated significantly by co-prescribing imipramine before and during the benzodiazepine taper. Daily benzodiazepine dose, severity of baseline symptoms of anxiety and depression, and duration of benzodiazepine use were additional significant predictors of successful taper outcome.","107 patients with diagnosed anxiety and who used anxiety-reducing benzodiazepine drugs (for 8.5 years on average) entered a program that ended their drug use. The program measured how antidepressant imipramine (180 mg/day) and anxiety-reducing busprione (38 mg/day) helps end benzodiazepine use compared to inactive treatment. After using either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam (anxiety-reducing benzodiazepines) for a period of time, patients used imipramine, busprione, or an inactive placebo for 4 weeks while benzodiazepine usage was stable. For 4-6 weeks, patients lessened benzodiazepine use. Then, for 5 weeks, patients kept using imipramine, busiprone, and inactive treatment until 3 weeks in this 5-week phase, at which all patients switched to inactive treatment for 2 weeks. Benzodiazepine blood levels were measured weekly. Benzodiazepine-free status was checked 3 and 12 months after treatment. Patients were long-term benzodiazepine users with an average of three failed attempts to lessen drug use. Success rate for lessening drug use was higher for patients taking imipramine (82.6%) and not much higher for patients taking buspirone (67.9%) compared to patients taking the inactive placebo (37.5%). The imipramine effect was still high even after accounting for benzodiazepine dose, baseline level of anxious symptoms, and duration of benzodiazepine treatment. Ending benzodiazepine drug use can be helped by using imipramine before and during the period of benzodiazepine drug use reduction. Daily benzodiazepine dose, severity of starting symptoms of anxiety and depression, and length of benzodiazepine use help predict successful reduction of drug use.","We enrolled 107 patients with generalized anxiety disorder who had been long-term benzodiazepine users (average length of use=8.5 years) in a program to discontinue benzodiazepines to measure how well other anxiety-reducing drugs like imipramine (180 mg/day) and buspirone (38 mg/day) helped patients wean or discontinue benzodiazepines compared to sugar pills. After a period to stabilize benzodiazepine levels taking either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam, patients took imipramine, buspirone, or sugar pills for 4 weeks while the amount of benzodiazepines taken were kept the same (treatment phase). Patients then slowly decreased the amount of benzodiazepines taken for 4-6 weeks, took imipramine, buspirone, and sugar pills for the next 3 weeks, and then took sugar pills for 2 weeks. Blood benzodiazepine levels were measured weekly using a common lab test. We measured how many patients no longer had benzodiazepine in their blood 3 and 12 months after the last sugar pill. Study participants had used benzodiazepines for a long time and had tried an average of three times to decrease the amount of benzodiazepines taken. Patients who took imipramine were significantly more successful in decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken (82.6%), nonsignificantly more successful regarding patients who took buspirone (67.9%), than for patients who took sugar pills (37.5%). Imipramine helped even after factoring in other factors to weaning success: amount of benzodiazepines taken, level of anxious feelings prior to weaning, and how long benzodiazepines have been taken. We concluded that discontinuing benzodiazepines can be done more easily by giving patients imipramine before and during the process of slowly decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken over time. Amount of benzodiazepines taken daily, level of anxiety and depression prior to weaning, and how long benzodiazepines have been taken also predicted success of slowly decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken."

45,30086256,"Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of topical pentoxifylline (PTX) on pressure ulcer (PU) healing in critically ill patients. Method: In this randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients with category I or II PUs were randomly assigned to receive either topical PTX 5% or a placebo twice daily for 14 days. Changes in PU characteristics (category and size) were assessed. The category of the PU was determined by the Stirling Pressure Ulcer Severity Scale (two-digit) at baseline (day zero), day seven and day 14 of treatment. PU length and width was measured with a disposable ruler and expressed as cm2. Results: A total of 112 adult patients were enrolled in the study. Median PU size and score at day zero were 32 (10.00-69.33)cm2 and 1(1.00-2.00) respectively. In the PTX group, the mean differences (95% confidence interval, CI) of all PU scores and sizes decreased significantly across the intervals (day seven versus day zero, day 14 versus day zero, and day 14 versus day seven), compared with the placebo group Conclusion: The severity and size of PUs improved significantly in patients who received topical PTX 5% ointment twice a day for 14 days compared with those in the placebo group.

Changes in PU (severity and size) were measured. The severity of PU was determined with a special scale at starting (day zero), day seven, and day 14 of the treatment. PU length and width was measured with a ruler in cm2. 112 adult patients enrolled in the study. Average PU size and score at day 0 were 32 cm2 and 1 respectively. In the PTX group, the average differences of all PU scores and sizes decreased greatly across the intervals (day seven vs day zero, day 14 vs day zero, and day 14 vs day seven), compared with the sham treatment group. The severity and size of PUs improved greatly in patients who received skin-level PTX 5% ointment twice a day for 14 days compared to those in the dummy treatment group. Skin-level PTX may be a possible option to treat mild and moderate PUs in very ill patients.","We aimed to rate how well pentoxifylline (PTX) applied to the skin worked to heal bedsores in critically ill patients. This was a medical study involving human participants in which neither side knew who was getting what treatment, and either PTX 5% or ointment with no medicine was applied to the skin twice a day for 14 days. We measured changes in bedsore category and size. We used a common scoring system to measure the severity of bedsores and bedsore stage at the beginning of the study and on study days 7 and 14. We measured bedsore length and width with a disposable ruler. We studied a total of 112 adult patients. Median (average) bedsore size and score at the beginning of the study were 32cm2 and 1, respectively. The average differences of bedsore scores and sizes decreased significantly between measurement days (day seven versus day zero, day 14 versus day zero, and day 14 versus day seven) compared to the ointment with no medicine. We conclude that the seriousness and size of bedsores improved significantly in patients who received PTX 5% ointment applied to the skin twice a day for 14 days compared to those who received ointment with no medicine. PTX applied to the skin may be a potential treatment option for stage I or II bedsores in critically ill patients."
25,34537363,"Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the impact of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) treatment and to determine whether the mAbs selective pressure could facilitate the proliferation of virus variants with spike protein mutations that might attenuate mAb effectiveness. Patients and methods: We therefore evaluated the impact of mAbs on the nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load and virus quasispecies of mAb-treated patients using single molecule real time sequencing (Pacific Biosciences). The mAbs used were: Bamlanivimab alone (4 patients), Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (23 patients), and Casirivimab/Imdevimab (5 patients). Results: The NP SARS-CoV-2 viral load of mAb-treated patients decreased from 8.2 log10 copies/ml before administration to 4.3 log10 copies/ml 7 days after administration. Five immunocompromised patients given Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab were found to have mAbs activity-reducing spike mutations. Two patients harbored SARS-CoV-2 variants with a Q493R spike mutation 7 days after administration, as did a third patient 14 days after administration. The fourth patient harbored a variant with a Q493K spike mutation 7 days post-treatment, and the fifth patient had a variant with a E484K spike mutation on day 21. The emergence of the spike mutation was accompanied by stabilization or rebound of the NP viral load in 3/5 patients. Conclusion: Two-m Ab therapy can drive the selection of resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants in immunocompromised patients. Patients given mAbs should be closely monitored and measures to limit virus spread reinforced.","This study aims to evaluate the impact of monoclonal antibodies, medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 (a viral lung infection) from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. The study also aims to determine if certain monoclonal antibodies can lead to spread of virus variants through mutations that may reduce the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies. Researchers evaluate the impact of monoclonal antibodies on the viral load (quantity of the virus) found in the nose and the number of mutations in patients treated with monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies used are bamlanivimab alone (in 4 patients), Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (in 23 patients), and Casirivimab/Imdevimab (in5 patients). The viral load in the nose of monoclonal antibodies-treated patients decreased 7 days after the medicines were given. Five patients with a weak immune system who were given Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab are found to have reduced mutations that allow the virus to enter cells and cause infection. Two patients with coronavirus variants have a mutation that enabled the virus to enter cells 7 days after the medicines are given. The same occurred with a third patient 14 days after the medicines are given. The fourth patient with a variant has a mutation 7 days after the medicine is stopped, and the fifth patient has a variant with a mutation on day 21. The start of the mutation is connected with a stable or increased viral load in the nose in 3 out of 5 patients. In conclusion, two monoclonal antibody drugs can drive the targeting of coronavirus variants in patients with weak immune systems. Patients given monoclonal antibody should be closely monitored, and measures to limit virus spread should be strengthened.","We aimed to test the effect of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibodies that bind to only one site of a foreign organism. We determine if mAbs may help grow mutated virus variants that may weaken mAb effectiveness. We test the effect of mAbs on the virus species and amount in the upper throat of mAb-treated patients. The mAbs used were: Bamlanivimab alone (4 patients), Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (23 patients), and Casirivimab/Imdevimab (5 patients). The amount of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which cause a respiratory illness, in the upper throats of mAb-treated patients decreased 7 days after treatment. Five patients with an impaired immune system and given Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab had mutations that reduced the effect of mAbs. Two patients with SARS-CoV-2 variants had a mutations 7 days after treatment, along with a third patient 14 days after treatment. The fourth patient had a variant with a mutation 7 days after treatment, along with a fifth patient on day 21. The onset of the mutation came with a rebound or stabilization of virus amount in 3/5 patients. Two-mAb treatment can lead to resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants in patients with an impaired immune system. Patients given mAbs should be monitored and measures to limit virus spread reinforced."
26,32594116,"Background: Patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often continue to test positive for the causative virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) even after clinical recovery, thereby complicating return-to-work plans. The purpose of this study was to evaluate transmission potential of COVID-19 by examining viral load with respect to time. Methods: Health care personnel (HCP) at Cleveland Clinic diagnosed with COVID-19, who recovered without needing hospitalization, were identified. Threshold cycles (Ct) for positive PCR tests were obtained and viral loads calculated. The association of viral load with days since symptom onset was examined in a multivariable regression model, which was reduced by stepwise backward selection to only keep variables significant at a level of .05. Viral loads by day since symptom onset were predicted using the model and transmission potential evaluated by examination of a viral load-time curve. Results: Over 6 weeks, 230 HCP had 528 tests performed. Viral loads declined by orders of magnitude within a few days of symptom onset. The only variable significantly associated with viral load was time since onset of symptoms. Of the area under the curve (AUC) spanning symptom onset to 30 days, 96.9% lay within the first 7 days, and 99.7% within 10 days. Findings were very similar when validated using split-sample and 10-fold cross-validation. Conclusions: Among patients with nonsevere COVID-19, viral loads in upper respiratory specimens peak by 2 or 3 days from symptom onset and decrease rapidly thereafter. The vast majority of the viral load-time AUC lies within 10 days of symptom onset.","Patients recovering from COVID-19 (a viral respiratory disease) oftentimes continue to test positive for (or have) the virus. This can make ""return to work"" plans difficult. The goal of this study is to evaluate COVID-19's ability to spread by determining the amount of the virus within an organism, known as the viral load, over time. Health care personnel at Cleveland Clinic diagnosed with COVID-19, who recovered without needing hospitalization, were identified. The viral load within the personnel was calculated. The link between the viral load within the patient and the first day of symptoms was evaluated. The viral load per day since the beginning of symptom onset within the patient were predicted using statistical models. Over six weeks, 230 health care personnel had 528 tests performed. The viral load within patients decreased within a few days of the beginning of virus-related symptoms. The viral load within the patient was significantly linked to time since onset of symptoms. The majority of the participants had peak viral load within the first 7 to 10 days. Findings were similar when other statistical tests were run. The authors concluded that among patients with no mild to moderate COVID-19, viral loads peaked by 2 or 3 days from symptom onset and decreased rapidly thereafter. The largest amount of viral load was on average within 10 days of symptom onset.",

24,8095725,"The respiratory and behavioral effects of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) inverse agonist ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) were determined alone and in combination with buspirone, lorazepam, flumazenil, and SR 95195 in rhesus monkeys. For the respiratory studies, one group of monkeys inhaled either air or 5% CO2 mixed in air according to a fixed alternating schedule; respiratory frequency and minute volume were monitored. For the behavioral studies, another group of monkeys responded under a fixed-ratio (FR 30) schedule of food presentation. The respiratory stimulant effects of beta-CCE in both air and 5% CO2 were enhanced by prior treatment with the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) partial agonist buspirone (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) and a weak BZR inverse agonist, SR 95195 (10.0 mg/kg). Coadministration of buspirone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) also potentiated the rate-decreasing effects of beta-CCE under the FR schedule. The BZR agonist lorazepam (3.0 mg/kg) and BZR antagonist flumazenil (1.0 mg/kg) attenuated the effects of beta-CCE on respiratory frequency and minute volume particularly under the 5% CO2 condition, and lorazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) attenuated the effects of beta-CCE on FR responding. These latter results show that the respiratory and behavioral effects of beta-CCE in rhesus monkeys are at least in part due to effects at BZRs. Moreover, the findings suggest either that coactivation of benzodiazepine and 5-HT1A sites lead to a greater than additive effect or that beta-CCE and buspirone share a common mechanism of action that is unrelated to the receptor at which BZR inverse agonists act.","We studied effects on breathing and behavior of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR; a molecule that receives signals for a cell) inverse agonist (a drug that binds to the same receptor as an agonist or stimulating molecule but causes an opposite response) ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) alone and with the anxiety-reducing drugs of buspirone, lorazepam, flumazenil, and SR 95195 in monkeys. For the breathing-related studies, one group of monkeys breathed air or 5% CO2 mixed in air; breaths per minute and amount of gas breathed were measured. For the behavior studies, another group of monkeys responded to food given every thirty seconds. The increased breathing effects of beta-CCE in both air and 5% CO2 were increased by previously taking the drugs of 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A), partial agonist buspirone (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) and a weak BZR inverse agonist, SR 95195 (10.0 mg/kg). Taking buspirone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) at the same time also increased effects of beta-CCE under the food schedule. The BZR agonist lorazepam (3.0 mg/kg) and BZR antagonist flumazenil (1.0 mg/kg) reduced the effects of beta-CCE on breaths per minute and amount of gas breathed especially under the 5% CO2 condition. Lorazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) reduced the effects of beta-CCE on behavior responding on the food schedule. These latter results shows that effects on breathing and behavior of beta-CCE in monkeys are at least due to effects at BZRs. The results also suggest that benzodiazepine and 5-HT1A sites activated at the same time cause an effect greater than their individual effects or that beta-CCE and buspirone work similarly independent of the receptor where BZR inverse antagonists work.",
49,23979346,"Aim: Leg edema, observed on comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) of 142 elderly outpatients with a variety of chronic diseases, was studied clinically to clarify its incidence and its associated risk factors. Methods: The severity of pitting edema was assessed at 3 points, namely, the pretibial edge, medial malleolus, and the dorsum of the foot. On palpation, edema was graded as 0 to 3 for each point on one leg, the sum of which was used as the edema score. According to the edema score, subjects were divided into 3 groups; the moderate to severe (MS) group, the slight to mild (SM) group, and the group without pitting edema. The MS group was defined as having an edema score of 4 or more or edema of grade 2 or more, while the SM group was defined as having an edema score of 2 to 3 points without edema of grade 2 or more. The status of underlying disease, vascular risks, varicose veins, medications, daily activity, nutrition, total protein (TP), albumin, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were compared among the 3 groups. Results: There were 36 subjects in the MS group and 19 subjects in the SM group. Diabetes, atrial fibrillation, varicose veins, and polypharmacy were more frequent in the MS group than in the control group. Sedentary life style, house-bound, and gait trouble were significantly more frequent in the MS and SM groups. There were no significant differences in the scores of the Mini-Nutritional Assessment Short Form among the groups, although both the body weight and calf circumference in the MS group were significantly greater than those in the group without pitting edema. Low serum TP, albumin and eGFR were seen in the MS group as well as high BNP levels. Multiple regression analysis revealed diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism, and hypoalbuminemia as risk factors associated with leg edema (R(2)=0.365, p<0.0001). Conclusion: Leg edema was frequent in the elderly outpatients and was associated strongly with diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism, and hypoalbuminemia. These findings suggest that advising against a sedentary life style could help the resolution of edema, and also indicates the clinical usefulness of CGA. Furthermore, leg edema should be seriously considered along with nutritional assessment because edema could influence various anthropometric parameters.","In this study, leg edema (fluid swelling) is studied to understand how frequently it occurs and its associated risk factors. Leg edema is observed on a detailed evaluation of older and frail people called the comprehensive geriatric (elderly) assessment of 142 elderly outpatients with a variety of chronic diseases. The severity of pitting edema, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation, is assessed at 3 places: the shins, the bony bump on the inside of the ankle, and the top part of the foot that faces up when standing. When pressing on the swollen area, edema is graded as 0 to 3 for each point on one leg, the sum of which was used as the edema score. According to the edema score, patients are divided into 3 groups; the moderate to severe group, the slight to mild group, and the group without pitting edema. The moderate to severe group is defined as having an edema score of 4 or more or edema of grade 2 or more, while the slight to mild group is defined as having an edema score of 2 to 3 points without edema of grade 2 or more. The following tests and measurements are compared among the 3 groups: the status of underlying disease, risks to developing heart problems, varicose (twisted, enlarged) veins, medications, daily activity, nutrition, tests for proteins in the body, and tests for how well the kidneys are working. There are 36 patients in the moderate to severe group and 19 subjects in the slight to mild group. Diabetes, an irregular heart beat (atrial fibrillation), varicose veins, and being on multiple drugs at one time are more frequent in the moderate to severe group than in the comparison group. Sedentary life style (no or little physical activity), house-bound, and walking trouble are much more frequent in the moderate to severe and slight to mild groups. There are no significant differences in the scores on malnourishment (poor nutrition) among the groups, although both the body weight and calf circumference (size) in the moderate to severe group are much greater than those in the group without pitting edema. Low levels of total protein in the blood, another protein made by liver called albumin, and kidney function tests are seen in the moderate to severe group as well as high levels of a protein made by heart and blood vessels called BNP. Data analysis revealed diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism (inactivity), and low levels of the protein albumin as risk factors associated with leg edema. In conclusion, leg edema is frequent in the elderly outpatients and is associated strongly with diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism, and low levels of albumin in the blood. These findings suggest that advising against an inactive life style could help resolve edema, and also indicates the usefulness of comprehensive geriatric assessment to evaluate older populations. Furthermore, leg edema should be seriously considered along with evaluating the diet of patients because edema could influence various physical measurements of the body.",
35,26458388,"We investigated the value of routine laboratory testing for identifying underlying causes in older men diagnosed with osteoporosis. Most osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic men had ≥1 laboratory abnormality. Few individual laboratory abnormalities were more common in osteoporotic men. The benefit of routine laboratory testing in older osteoporotic men may be low. Introduction: To evaluate the utility of recommended laboratory testing to identify secondary causes in older men with osteoporosis, we examined prevalence of laboratory abnormalities in older men with and without osteoporosis. Methods: One thousand five hundred seventy-two men aged ≥65 years in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men study completed bone mineral density (BMD) testing and a battery of laboratory measures, including serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 25-OH vitamin D, total testosterone, spot urine calcium/creatinine ratio, spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio, creatinine-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate, 24-h urine calcium, and 24-h urine free cortisol. Using cross-sectional analyses, we calculated prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the association of any and specific laboratory abnormalities with osteoporosis and the number of men with osteoporosis needed to test to identify one additional laboratory abnormality compared to testing men without osteoporosis. Results: Approximately 60 % of men had ≥1 laboratory abnormality in both men with and without osteoporosis. Among individual tests, only vitamin D insufficiency (PR, 1.13; 95 % CI, 1.05-1.22) and high alkaline phosphatase (PR, 3.05; 95 % CI, 1.52-6.11) were more likely in men with osteoporosis. Hypercortisolism and hyperthyroidism were uncommon and not significantly more frequent in men with osteoporosis. No osteoporotic men had hypercalciuria. Conclusions: Though most of these older men had ≥1 laboratory abnormality, few routinely recommended individual tests were more common in men with osteoporosis than in those without osteoporosis. Possibly excepting vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase, benefit of routine laboratory testing to identify possible secondary causes in older osteoporotic men appears low. Results may not be generalizable to younger men or to older men in whom history and exam findings raise clinical suspicion for a secondary cause of osteoporosis.","We looked at how helpful routine lab testing is for finding underlying causes in older men diagnosed with osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle). Most men with and without osteoporosis had one or more abnormal lab measurement. Few single lab abnormalities were more common in men with osteoporosis. Routine lab testing in older men with osteoporosis may not be helpful. We aim to rate how useful recommended lab testing is to find underlying causes of osteoporosis in older men by looking at the number of older men with lab abnormalities with and without osteoporosis during a specific period. We studied 1,572 men 65 years old and older who has bone mineral density (BMD) testing and many other lab measurements. We checked for links of any lab abnormalities with osteoporosis and the number of men with osteoporosis needed to test to find one more lab abnormality compared to testing men without osteoporosis. We found that about 60% of men with and without osteoporosis had one or more lab abnormality. Among lab tests, only not enough vitamin D and high alkaline phosphatase (suggesting damage to liver or bone disorder) were more likely in men with osteoporosis. Too much cortisol (stress hormone) and overactive thyroid (metabolism-regulating hormone) were rare and not meaningfully more common in men with osteoporosis. No men with osteoporosis had high levels of calcium in the urine. Though most of these older men had one or more lab abnormality, few often-recommended tests were more common in men with osteoporosis than in those without. Except for possibly vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase, usefulness of routine lab testing to find possible underlying causes in older men with osteoporosis seems low. Results may not apply to younger men or to older men thought to have osteoporosis from underlying causes.",
11,33092611,"Background: The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes the irreversible decarboxylation of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. PDC deficiency can be caused by alterations in any of the genes encoding its several subunits. The resulting phenotype, though very heterogeneous, mainly affects the central nervous system. The aim of this study is to describe and discuss the clinical, biochemical and genotypic information from thirteen PDC deficient patients, thus seeking to establish possible genotype-phenotype correlations. Results: The mutational spectrum showed that seven patients carry mutations in the PDHA1 gene encoding the E1α subunit, five patients carry mutations in the PDHX gene encoding the E3 binding protein, and the remaining patient carries mutations in the DLD gene encoding the E3 subunit. These data corroborate earlier reports describing PDHA1 mutations as the predominant cause of PDC deficiency but also reveal a notable prevalence of PDHX mutations among Portuguese patients, most of them carrying what seems to be a private mutation (p.R284X). The biochemical analyses revealed high lactate and pyruvate plasma levels whereas the lactate/pyruvate ratio was below 16; enzymatic activities, when compared to control values, indicated to be independent from the genotype and ranged from 8.5% to 30%, the latter being considered a cut-off value for primary PDC deficiency. Concerning the clinical features, all patients displayed psychomotor retardation/developmental delay, the severity of which seems to correlate with the type and localization of the mutation carried by the patient. The therapeutic options essentially include the administration of a ketogenic diet and supplementation with thiamine, although arginine aspartate intake revealed to be beneficial in some patients. Moreover, in silico analysis of the missense mutations present in this PDC deficient population allowed to envisage the molecular mechanism underlying these pathogenic variants. Conclusion: The identification of the disease-causing mutations, together with the functional and structural characterization of the mutant protein variants, allow to obtain an insight on the severity of the clinical phenotype and the selection of the most appropriate therapy.","The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is a chemical process in the body that converts molecules and links cells to the final stage of creating energy. PDC deficiency or shortage is a disorder that can be caused by changes in genes. The result of PDC deficiency mainly affects the central nervous system (the spinal cord and brain). This study aims to describe the clinical, biochemical (the chemical processes in living organisms), and genetic information in 13 patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency. All 13 patients carry some type of mutation in the genes that are involved in the PDC process. The mutation in the PDHA1 gene (a gene that helps encode a building block of PDC) is the most common. These data support earlier reports describing PDHA1 mutations as the main cause of PDC deficiency. The data also reveal a notable frequency of the PDHX mutation (another gene that helps encode a building block of PDC) among Portuguese patients who seem to carry a mutation in the community or population. The biochemical analysis showed high levels of lactic acid (high levels occur when oxygen in the body decreases) and high levels of pyruvate plasma (a molecule that helps change sugar in the blood to energy when oxygen levels are low). All patients showed developmental delay (delays or slowness in reaching language, thinking, or motor skills). How serious these delays are seems to match up with the type and location of the mutation carried by the patient. Treatment options include a ketogenic diet (low-carb/high-fat diet) and adding a vitamin called thiamine to the diet, although taking a supplement called arginine aspartate (used for helping to build proteins) may be beneficial in some patients. Moreover, computer modeling of these gene mutations in this PDC deficient population created a picture of underlying causes of these mutations. The identification of the disease-causing mutations provides an insight on the severity of their impact on development and the selection of the best therapy.","The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) quickens the permanent conversion of pyruvate (a particle used for energy-production) into acetyl-CoA (another particle used for energy production). PDC shortage can occur from changes in genes involved in creating its components. The resulting physical traits, though very different, mainly affect the brain and spinal cord. This study explores the medical, biochemical and gene-related information from thirteen PDC scarce patients. The study seeks to create possible gene-physical trait connections. The data agrees with earlier reports describing a specfic gene's sequence changes as the main cause of PDC shortage. However, the results also reveal a large presence of another gene's sequence changes among Portuguese patients. Most carry a possibly private gene sequence change. Regarding medical characteristics, all patients show coordination setback, the intensity of which seems to parallel the type and location of the patient's gene sequence change. Treatment options include administration of a low-carb diet and thiamine, although arginine aspartate may also help. Identifying disease-causing gene sequence changes, along with the altered cellular substances, help explain the physical traits caused by the disease and select the best treatment."
36,34603756,"The introduction of technologically advanced methods of lithotripsy into medical practice changes the nature of postoperative complications. Among them, the main complications are inflammatory infections. This largely determines the search for new, improved methods of stone fragmentation avoiding small stone fragments and dissemination of the pelvicalyceal system of the kidney with stone-associated infection. The authors have developed a method for controlled stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a hot-spot effect at the optical fiber end. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of controlled urinary stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a highly heated distal end of the optical fiber light guide as a method of preventing inflammatory infections in clinical practice. Materials and methods: We analyzed 1666 case histories of urolithiasis patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotripsy/ nephrolithoextraction and contact ureterolithotripsy/ureteroextraction, we also performed a prospective analysis of complications based on the Clavien-Dindo classification in 90 patients who underwent fine fragmentation of stones with various lithotripters: ultrasonic, pneumatic, and holmium laser. The method of controlled stone fragmentation by a diode laser with a hot-spot effect was tested on postoperative samples of 26 renal calculi. For the first time in clinical practice, this method was tested in the bladder cavity (n=10). Results: In the percutaneous nephrolithotripsy group, postoperative infectious and inflammatory complications occurred in 34.1% of cases, in the percutaneous nephrolithoextraction group - in 24.6%, in the contact ureterolithotripsy group - in 7.8%, in the ureterolithoextraction group - in 2.5%. The analysis made it possible to identify factors promoting the development of infectious and inflammatory complications. For the first time in clinical practice, there were successfully performed ten operations of stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a hot-spot effect. Controlled coarse fragmentation of stones providing the possibility to reduce the number of infectious and inflammatory complications was performed in the bladder as a model for testing the method. Conclusion: The method of laser-induced controlled coarse fragmentation of stones with a hot-spot effect, developed and tested in clinical practice, is promising for the prevention of infectious and inflammatory complications in patients with potentially infected stones since their fine fragmentation and, consequently, spread of stone-associated toxins and microflora within the urinary system is avoided.","Introducing lithotripsy, a non-surgical method to break masses like kidney stones into pieces, into medical practice changes the type of complications that may occur after operations. The main complications are inflammatory infections that may result in pain, redness, or swelling. New and improved methods of breaking down stones, avoiding small stone fragments and sending them through the kidneys to be released through urine are searched. The authors develop a method to break stones using a continuous-wave diode laser, which is a constant stream of laser light that can also reduce the scattering of stones by using a hot-spot or energy-focused effect. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of controlling the fragmenting of urinary stones (hard masses of minerals in the bladder), using a continuous-wave diode laser as a method of preventing inflammatory infections. Researchers analyzed 1666 cases of patients with kidney stones who underwent different methods to remove kidney stones. These methods include percutaneous nephrolithotripsy/nephrolithoextraction (removal of stones by a small incision through the skin and stones pulled out of the incision) and ureterolithotripsy/ureteroextraction (when a flexible tube is inserted through the bladder and the ureter which connects the kidneys and bladder and stones are found with a camera and removed). An additional analysis on 90 patients is also done on patients with stones that were fragmented into tiny pieces using different lithotripters, non-surgical devices that crush stones using shock waves. The method of controlled stone fragmentation by a diode laser with a hot-spot effect is tested on samples of 26 kidney stones during or after operations. For the first time in clinical practice, this method is tested in the bladder (with 10 patients). In the group that underwent a small incision to remove the stone, infections and inflammation complications after the procedure occurred in 34.1% of cases. In the group that had stones removed from the incision (nephrolithoextraction) had complications in 24.6%, and in the ureterolithotripsy group where a tube and camera are used, there are 7.8% cases with complications. In the ureterolithoextraction group, there are complications in 2.5%. The analysis makes it possible to find things that lead to the development of infectious or inflammatory complications. For the first time, there are successfully performed ten operations of stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a hot-spot effect. Controlling the scattering of fragments of stones makes it possible to reduce the number of infectious and inflammatory complications and is done in the bladder as an example for testing this method. In conclusion, using a laser to control fragmented stones with the hot spot effect is a promising way to prevent infection and inflammation complications in patients with possibly infected stones since small pieces of stones and their spread within the urinary system is avoided.","New advanced technology for breaking up stones in the kidney and the tube to the bladder changes the nature of issues after operation. Among them, the main issues are inflammatory infections. This influences the search for new, improved ways of breaking up stones to avoid small fragments and spreading stone-associated infection in the kidney and bladder system. We have created a method for controlled breaking up of stones with a special laser with a hot-spot at one end. This study evaluates the effectiveness of controlled breaking up of stones in urine using a special laser with a hot-spot at one end to prevent inflammatory infections in clinics. We analyzed 1666 patient cases of patients with kidney stones who had operations to remove the stones in the kidney and urine. We also analyzed any complications in 90 patients who had treatment with various devices to break up stones: sound waves, pressurized air, and lasers. The method of controlled breaking up of stones with a special laser with a hot-spot was tested on 26 kidney stone samples collected after surgery. For the first time in clinical practice, this method was tested in the hole in the bladder of 10 patients. In the group that had a small cut to remove kidney stones, infections and inflammatory issues after surgery occured in 34.1% of cases. In the group that had a cut and small tube to remove stones, infections and issues occured in 24.6%. In the group that had a small cut to remove stones in the urine, infections and issues occured in 7.8%. In the group that had a cut and tube to remove stones, infections and issues occured in 2.5%. The analysis helped identify factors that promoted infectious and inflammatory issues. For the first time in clinical practice, there were 10 successful operations of breaking up stones with a special laser with a hot-spot. Controlled breaking up of stones, which may reduce the number of infectious and inflammatory effects, was done in the bladder to test the method. The method of using a laser with a hot-spot to break up stones, developed and tested in clinical practice, may prevent infectious and inflammatory effects in patients with possibly infected stones since their previous stone fragmentation. This method may also prevent spread of stone-associated toxins and bacteria in the urinary system."

As the fifth class of histone proteins the linker histones not only interact with DNA and core histones but also with other chromatin proteins. These interactions prove to be essential for the higher levels of chromatin organization like chromatin loops, transcription factories and chromosome territories. Our recent results have proved that Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone - Hho1p, physically interacts with the actin-related protein 4 (Arp4) and that the abrogation of this interaction through the deletion of the gene for the linker histone in arp4 mutant cells leads to global changes in chromatin compaction. Here, we show that the healthy interaction between the yeast linker histone and Arp4p is critical for maintaining genome stability and for controlling cellular sensitivity to different types of stress. The abolished interaction between the linker histone and Arp4p leads the mutant yeast cells to premature ageing phenotypes. Cells die young and are more sensitive to stress.

50,18496408,"Objective: To compare the accuracy of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein as diagnostic markers of bacterial infection in critically ill children at the onset of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary care, university-affiliated pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Patients: Consecutive patients with SIRS. Interventions: From June to December 2002, all PICU patients were screened daily to include cases of SIRS. At inclusion (onset of SIRS), procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels as well as an array of cultures were obtained. Diagnosis of bacterial infection was made a posteriori by an adjudicating process (consensus of experts unaware of the results of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein). Baseline and daily data on severity of illness, organ dysfunction, and outcome were collected. Measurements and main results: Sixty-four patients were included in the study and were a posteriori divided into the following groups: bacterial SIRS (n = 25) and nonbacterial SIRS (n = 39). Procalcitonin levels were significantly higher in patients with bacterial infection compared with patients without bacterial infection (p = .01). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for procalcitonin was greater than that for C-reactive protein (0.71 vs. 0.65, respectively). A positive procalcitonin level (>or=2.5 ng/mL), when added to bedside clinical judgment, increased the likelihood of bacterial infection from 39% to 92%, while a negative C-reactive protein level (<40 mg/L) decreased the probability of bacterial infection from 39% to 2%. Conclusions: Procalcitonin is better than C-reactive protein for differentiating bacterial from nonbacterial SIRS in critically ill children, although the accuracy of both tests is moderate. Diagnostic accuracy could be enhanced by combining these tests with bedside clinical judgment.","The study's objective is to compare the accuracy of procalcitonin (a prototype molecule for a calcium-regulating molecule) and C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation) as markers of bacterial infection in very ill children at the start of full-body or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), an exaggerated immune response to a harmful stressor. The study takes place at a university-partnered child-care unit. Patients include those with SIRS. Treatment was that from June to December 2002, all hospital patients were tested daily to include cases of SIRS. At inclusion (start of SIRS), we measured procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and some cell types. Identification of bacterial infection was made based on facts and judgment of experts unaware of the procalcitonin and C-reactive protein measures.

From June to December 2002, all PICU patients were screened daily to include cases of SIRS. At inclusion (onset of SIRS), procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels, along with several bacterial cultures (bacterial groups grown in a lab), were obtained. Diagnosis of bacterial infection was made following examination of the cultures. Baseline (before study) and daily data on severity of illness, organ dysfunction, and outcome were collected. Sixty-four patients were included in the study. All patients were divided into the one of two groups: bacterial SIRS (25 patients) and nonbacterial SIRS (39 patients). Procalcitonin levels were significantly higher in patients with bacterial infection compared with patients without bacterial infection. Volume of procalcitonin was more predictive of bacterial infection than C-reactive protein. A positive (detected) procalcitonin level increased the likelihood of bacterial infection. A negative (not detected) C-reactive protein level decreased the probability of bacterial infection. Procalcitonin is better than C-reactive protein for differentiating (identifying) bacterial from nonbacterial SIRS in critically ill children. However, the accuracy of both biomarkers is moderate.

23,17443661,"""Inborn errors of metabolism,"" first recognized 100 years ago by Garrod, were seen as transforming evidence for chemical and biological individuality. Phenylketonuria (PKU), a Mendelian autosomal recessive phenotype, was identified in 1934 by Asbjörn Fölling. It is a disease with impaired postnatal cognitive development resulting from a neurotoxic effect of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). Its metabolic phenotype is accountable to multifactorial origins both in nurture, where the normal nutritional experience introduces L-phenylalanine, and in nature, where mutations (>500 alleles) occur in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH) on chromosome 12q23.2 encoding the L-phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme (EC 1.14.16.1). The PAH enzyme converts phenylalanine to tyrosine in the presence of molecular oxygen and catalytic amounts of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), its nonprotein cofactor. PKU is among the first of the human genetic diseases to enter, through newborn screening, the domain of public health, and to show a treatment effect. This effect caused a paradigm shift in attitudes about genetic disease. The PKU story contains many messages, including: a framework on which to appreciate the complexity of PKU in which phenotype reflects both locus-specific and genomic components; what the human PAH gene tells us about human population genetics and evolution of modern humans; and how our interest in PKU is served by a locus-specific mutation database (http://www.pahdb.mcgill.ca; last accessed 20 March 2007). The individual Mendelian PKU phenotype has no ""simple"" or single explanation; every patient has her/his own complex PKU phenotype and will be treated accordingly. Knowledge about PKU reveals genomic components of both disease and health.","""Inborn errors of metabolism,"" first identified 100 years ago by Garrod, are metabolic errors from birth and important evidence for chemical and biological individuality. Asbjörn Fölling identified phenylketonuria (PKU), an inherited physical disorder, in 1934. PKU impairs cognitive development due to toxic buildup of a specific molecule, phenylalanine. The metabolic characteristics of PKU occur due to nurture, in which a normal diet includes the molecule L-phenylalanine, and nature, where DNA mutations influence the gene that creates the L-phenylalanine breakdown enzyme. The phenylalanine breakdown enzyme converts PKU into another molecule, tyrosine, using oxygen and non-protein helpers. PKU is among the first genetic diseases to enter, via newborn testing, publich health and demonstrate the use of successful treatment. This success of treatment has shifted attitudes about genetic diseases. PKU shows how DNA and genes affect physical traits, how modern humans have evolved, and how genetic databases now exist to document genetic mutations. Every individual has unique, physical characteristics involving PKU that require unique treatment. PKU shows the genetic components of disease and health.","""Inborn errors of metabolism,"" or inherited disorders in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy, first seen by a doctor 100 years ago, were important support for the idea that people have different chemical and biological makeups. Phenylketonuria (PKU), a disorder inherited from both parents, was discovered in 1934 by a doctor. It causes intellectual disability from damage to the brain caused by too much phenylalanine in the blood. Observable PKU symptoms vary due to nurture, where normal foods contain L-phenylalanine, and in nature, where many changes happen in the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) that controls the L-phenylalanine hydroxylase protein, which helps convert phenylalanine into energy. The PAH protein converts phenylalanine, one molecule, to tyrosine, another molecule. Through checks for conditions that affect newborns, PKU is one of the first inherited diseases to be prevented in the community with successful treatments. Successful treatments caused a change in thinking about inherited disease. The history of PKU provides a lot of information including a way to grasp how complicated the disease is and where observable symptoms depend on both gene location and makeup; what the human PAH gene tells us about the genetics and evolution of humans; and how our understanding of PKU is helped by a database on where gene changes happen. Observable PKU symptoms have no ""simple"" or single explanation; every patient is different and will be treated at an individual level.

45,34692658,"Pressure ulcer (PU) is a worldwide problem that is hard to heal because of its prolonged inflammatory response and impaired ECM deposition caused by local hypoxia and repeated ischemia/reperfusion. Our previous study discovered that the non-fouling zwitterionic sulfated poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (SBMA) hydrogel can improve PU healing with rapid ECM rebuilding. However, the mechanism of the SBMA hydrogel in promoting ECM rebuilding is unclear. Therefore, in this work, the impact of the SBMA hydrogel on ECM reconstruction is comprehensively studied, and the underlying mechanism is intensively investigated in a rat PU model. The in vivo data demonstrate that compared to the PEG hydrogel, the SBMA hydrogel enhances the ECM remolding by the upregulation of fibronectin and laminin expression as well as the inhibition of MMP-2. Further investigation reveals that the decreased MMP-2 expression of zwitterionic SBMA hydrogel treatment is due to the activation of autophagy through the inhibited PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and reduced inflammation. The association of autophagy with ECM remodeling may provide a way in guiding the design of biomaterial-based wound dressing for chronic wound repair.","Bedsores are a worldwide problem that is hard to heal because it causes long-lasting inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) and harms the extracellular matrix (ECM; secreted by cells and surrounds cells in tissues) from not enough oxygen and blood flow.

However, scientists are unsure how SBMA hydrogel rebuilds ECM. In this study, we look at how SBMA hydrogel rebuilds ECM using a rat bedsore model. SMBA hydrogel helps remodel ECM better than PEG hydrogel, another bedsore treatment. The relationship between autophagy (cleaning out of damaged cells) with ECM remodeling may influence the design of wound dressings with substances that interact with biological systems for long-term wound repair.",
12,26854761,"Purpose of review: This article presents recent findings and perspectives on the relationship between early-life respiratory infections and asthma inception, and discusses emerging concepts on strategies that target these infectious agents for asthma prevention. Recent findings: Cumulative evidence supports the role of early-life viral infections, especially respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus, as major antecedents of childhood asthma. These viruses may have different mechanistic roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. The airway microbiome and virus-bacteria interactions in early life have emerged as additional determinants of childhood asthma. Innovative strategies for the prevention of these early-life infections, or for attenuation of acute infection severity, are being investigated and may identify effective strategies for the primary and secondary prevention of childhood asthma. Summary: Early-life infections are major determinants of asthma development. The pathway from early-life infections to asthma is the result of complex interactions between the specific type of the virus, genetic, and environmental factors. Novel intervention strategies that target these infectious agents have been investigated in proof-of-concepts trials, and further study is necessary to determine their capacity for asthma prevention.","This article describes the relationship between early-life respiratory infections (infections in the lungs that impact breathing and occur in the first few years of life) and how asthma begins. The article also discusses new strategies to prevent asthma by stopping these infections. Viruses that occur in early life, especially respiratory syncytial virus (a contagious virus that infects the lungs and airway tubes) and human rhinovirus (the common cold), usually occur before asthma starts. These viruses may have different roles in how asthma develops. How airway microbiome (micro-organisms such as bacteria in the lungs) interact with bacteria from viruses may determine that a child will develop asthma. New strategies for preventing these infections that occur early in life, or for weakening the symptoms of infections, are being investigated and may help prevent childhood asthma. In summary, early-life infections are major factors of asthma development. How these early-life infections lead to asthma is from the reactions between the virus, genes, and the environment. New treatment and therapy strategies that target these infections have been researched, and more studies are needed to see if they will help prevent asthma.",

Collectively, this group of devices was first introduced in the 1950s, shortly after the advent of the transistor. As technology has improved, so has the pacemaker device. The first implantable ICD was developed in 1980, and since that time, it has become more difficult to differentiate between pacemakers and ICDs. This is because every ICD currently implanted has an anti-bradycardia pacing function. It is critical for the patient and any health care provider to understand which device has been implanted to prevent unnecessary ICD therapy. This is most likely to occur with any electromagnetic interference (EMI) and could lead to activation of the device (if it is an ICD). Most types of CIED use several insulated lead wires with non-insulated tips that are implanted in the heart, either by percutaneous vein insertion or directly by a cardiac surgeon. Cardiac pacemakers are made up of two parts: the pulse generator and the leads or electrodes.","Pacemakers are adjustable artificial electrical pulse generators commonly to aid heart rate, frequently emitting a pulse between 0.5 and 25 milliseconds with 0.1 to 15 volts, up to 300 times per minute. The heart specialist or pacemaker technologist can assess and control the pacing rate, pulse width, voltage, and whether the device is temporary or permanent. Pacemakers are usually categorized as external or internal. The external type is almost always placed for temporary stabilization of the patient or to help some type of surgery. The implantable type is usually permanent and often, more complex than the temporary, external type. Pacemakers are one type of heart-related or cardiac implantable electronic devices (or CIED). CIEDs also include implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), which corrects irregular heart beats. Together, this group of devices was first introduced in the 1950s, shortly after the transistor, which alters electrical signals. As technology improved, so has the pacemaker. The first implantable ICD was created in 1980. Since then, it has become more difficult to differentiate between pacemakers and ICDs. This difficulty is because every ICD currently implanted aids against a slow heart rate. It is important for the patient and clinician to know which device has been implanted to prevent unnecessary ICD therapy. This is likely to occur with any electromagnetic interference (EMI) and may activate the device (if it is an ICD). Most types of CIEDs use many electrically-isolated lead wires with non-electrically-isolated tips impanted in the heart, either by skin vein insertion or directly by a heart surgeon. Heart-related pacemakers are made of the pulse generator and the leads or electrical contact points.","Pacemakers are devices that generate artificial electrical pulses. A heart specialist or pacemaker technologist will be able to control the pacing rate and other functions, whether the device is temporary or permanent.

33,7665723,"Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant drug, which in man is cleared solely by renal excretion and is not bound to plasma proteins. Because the clearance of gabapentin is dependent on renal function, the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin were investigated in anuric subjects maintained on hemodialysis. Plasma samples were obtained over an 8-day period after administration of single oral 400-mg doses of gabapentin. Pre- and post-dialyzer plasma samples and dialysate samples from quantitative collection of dialyzer effluent were obtained during hemodialysis sessions performed 2, 4, and 7 days after dosing. A mean (SD) maximum gabapentin plasma concentration of 6.0 (2.4) micrograms/mL was achieved at 4.7 (2.1) hours post-dose. The elimination half-life of gabapentin on non-hemodialysis days averaged 132 hours. Approximately 35% of the gabapentin dose was recovered in dialysate, and mean hemodialysis clearance of gabapentin was 142 (26) mL/min; approximately 93% of the dialyzer creatinine clearance. Gabapentin elimination half-life during hemodialysis was approximately 4 hours. Systemic plasma gabapentin concentrations increased approximately 30% during the first 2 hours after hemodialysis as a result of drug redistribution in the body. It is recommended that patients with end-stage renal disease maintained on hemodialysis receive an initial 300-mg to 400-mg gabapentin loading dose. Plasma gabapentin concentrations can be maintained by giving 200 to 300 mg of gabapentin after every 4 hours of hemodialysis.","Gabapentin is a nerve-related pain drug, which in humans is cleared from the body solely by the kidneys and is not attached to proteins in plasma (the liquid part of blood). Because the clearance of gabapentin depends on the kidneys, how the body processes gabapentin is investigated in patients who do not make enough urine and who are on dialysis, a process of cleaning the blood of a person whose kidneys are not working normally. Plasma samples are collected over an 8-day period after a single oral (by mouth) dose of gabapentin is given. Plasma samples before and after being filtered, as well as dialysis fluid, are collected during dialysis sessions performed 2, 4, and 7 days after receiving the gabapentin dose. An average maximum amount of gabapentin in plasma is achieved at 4.7 hours after the dose. The time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma to be reduced by half on non-dialysis days averages 132 hours. About 35% of gabapentin dose is recovered in dialysis fluid, and the average clearance of gabapentin in dialysis was 142 milliliters per minute. The time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma to be reduced by half during dialysis is about 4 hours. Gabapentin concentrations in the plasma increased about 30% during the first 2 hours after dialysis as a result of the drug being sent to other parts of the body. It is recommended that patients with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis receive a starting 300-mg to 400-mg gabapentin dose. Plasma gabapentin concentrations can remain stable by giving 200 to 300 mg of gabapentin after every 4 hours of dialysis.","Gabapentin is an antiseizure drug, which in man is cleared just by kidney removal and is not bound to blood proteins. Because gabapentin clearance is dependent on kidney function, the drug activity of gabapentin was investigated in patients unable to make urine and maintained on artifical kidney machines or hemodialysis. We took blood samples over an 8-day period after treatment of single 400-mg swallowed doses of gabapentin. Blood and kidney solution samples were obtained during treatment sessions performed 2, 4, and 7 days after dosing. An average maximum gabapentin blood level of 6.0 micrograms/mL was measured at 4.7 hours after the dose. The time for half of gabapentin to clear on non-hemodialysis days was 132 hours. Around 35% of the gabapentin dose was recovered in the fluid of the artificial kidney machine. The average hemodialysis clearance of gabapentin was 142 mL/min; around 93% of the standard dialyzer clearance. The time for half of gabapentin to clear during hemodialysis was around 4 hours. Blood gabapentin levels increased around 30% during the first 2 hours after hemodialysis due to drug redistribution in the body. It is recommended that patients with kidney failure and on hemodialysis get an initial 300-mg to 400-mg gabapentin starting dose. Blood gabapentin levels can be maintained by giving 200 to 300 mg of gabapentin after every 4 hours of hemodialysis."

Currently, no cure for OA is known, and non-pharmacological modalities are recommended as first-line care. A positive effect of exercise in hip and knee OA has been documented, but the effect of exercise on hand OA remains uncertain. Authors' conclusions: When we pooled results from five studies, we found low-quality evidence showing small beneficial effects of exercise on hand pain, function and finger joint stiffness. Estimated effect sizes were small, and whether they represent a clinically important change may be debated. One study reported quality of life, and the effect is uncertain.

A report published in Pediatrics outlined the effects of maternal and infant nutrition on the development of atopic disease (including asthma) in children, reflecting that multiple factors could act in concert to influence disease development. Maternal exposure to vitamin D has been investigated as a risk factor for childhood asthma and wheeze, with conflicting findings; several studies have reported that vitamin D could protect against asthma attacks or prevent worsening asthma symptoms. Many studies have investigated such associations with risk of disease, but the reporting in the media of the study findings often leaves much to be desired in terms of nuance and balance.","Several risk factors for developing asthma are linked with being exposed to certain things during pregnancy.

53,10535452,"The objective of this study was to evaluate whether first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with type 2 diabetes had abnormal circadian insulin secretion and, if so, whether this abnormality affected their glucose metabolism. Six African-American FDRs with normal glucose tolerance and 12 matched normal control subjects (who had no family history of diabetes) were exposed to 48 h of hyperglycemic clamping (approximately 12 mmol/l). Insulin secretion rates (ISRs) were determined by deconvolution of plasma C-peptide levels using individual C-peptide kinetic parameters. Detrending and smoothing of data (z-scores) and computation of autocorrelation functions were used to identify ISR cycles. During the initial hours after start of glucose infusions, ISRs were approximately 60% higher in FDRs than in control subjects (585 vs. 366 nmol/16 h, P < 0.05), while rates of glucose uptake were the same (5.6 mmol x kg(-1) x h(-1)), indicating that the FDRs were insulin resistant. Control subjects had well-defined circadian (24 h) cycles of ISR and plasma insulin that rose in the early morning, peaked in the afternoon, and declined during the night. In contrast, FDRs had several shorter ISR cycles of smaller amplitude that lacked true periodicity. This suggested that the lack of a normal circadian ISR increase had made it impossible for the FDRs to maintain their compensatory insulin hypersecretion beyond 18 h of hyperglycemia. As a result, ISR decreased to the level found in control subjects, and glucose uptake fell below the level of control subjects (61 vs. 117 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.05). In summary, we found that FDRs with normal glucose tolerance had defects in insulin action and secretion. The newly recognized insulin secretory defect consisted of disruption of the normal circadian ISR cycle, which resulted in reduced insulin secretion (and glucose uptake) during the ascending part of the 24 h ISR cycle.","Insulin secretion is the body's release of insulin, the hormone that helps control blood sugar and metabolism. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether first-degree relatives (a person's parent, sibling, or child) of patients with type 2 diabetes have abnormal 24 hour insulin secretion and, if so, whether this abnormality affected their glucose metabolism. Six African-American first-degree relatives with normal blood sugar level and 12 normal control participants (who had no family history of diabetes) were exposed to 48 hours of hyperglycemic clamping, a technique to keep blood sugar levels stable. Insulin secretion rates (ISRs) are determined by calculating plasma C-peptide levels, which are substances that signal if the body is creating insulin. During the initial hours after giving people infusions of sugar (glucose), insulin secretion rates are about 60% higher in first-degree relatives than in the comparison (control) subjects, while rates of sugar uptake are the same. This finding suggests that the first-degree relatives are insulin resistant, which is when the body doesn't respond well to the insulin hormone and can't use blood sugar for energy. Control subjects have well-defined 24 hour cycles of insulin secretion rates and plasma insulin that increase in the early morning, peak in the afternoon, and decline during the night. In contrast, first-degree relatives have several shorter insulin secretion rate cycles. This suggests that the lack of a normal increase in the 24 hour insulin secretion rate makes it impossible for the first-degree relatives to keep their insulin excess secretion beyond 18 hours of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). As a result, insulin secretion rate decreased to the level found in control subjects, and blood sugar uptake fell below the level of control subjects. In summary, researchers found that first-degree relatives with normal blood sugar levels had defects in insulin action and secretion. The new insulin secretory defect includes disrupting the normal 24 hour insulin secretion rate cycle, which resulted in reduced insulin secretion (and blood sugar uptake) during the upward part of the 24 hour insulin secretion rate cycle.",
13,26048677,"Introduction: Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is one of the extracardiac reasons of atrial fibrillation (AF), and the prevalence of AF is high in SAHS-diagnosed patients. Nocturnal hypoxemia is associated with AF, pulmonary hypertension, and nocturnal death. The rate of AF recurrence is high in untreated SAHS-diagnosed patients after cardioversion (CV). In this study, we present a patient whose SAHS was diagnosed with an apnea test performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and who did not develop recurrent AF after the administration of standard AF treatment and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP). Case presentation: A 57-year-old male hypertensive Caucasian patient who was on medical treatment for 1.5 months for non-organic AF was admitted to the ICU because of high-ventricular response AF (170 per minute), and sinus rhythm was maintained during the CV that was performed two times every second day. The results of the apnea test performed in the ICU on the same night after the second CV were as follows: apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 71 per hour, minimum peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 67%, and desaturation period (SpO2 of less than 90%) of 28 minutes. The patient was discharged with medical treatment and nocturnal BiPAP treatment. The results of the apnea test performed under BiPAP on the sixth month were as follows: AHI of 1 per hour, desaturation period of 1 minute, and minimum SpO2 of 87%. No recurrent AF developed in the patient, and his medical treatment was reduced within 6 months. After gastric bypass surgery on the 12th month, nocturnal hypoxia and AF did not re-occur. Thus, BiPAP and medical treatments were ended. Conclusions: SAHS can be diagnosed by performing an apnea test in the ICU. SAHS should be investigated in patients developing recurrent AF after CV. Recovery of nocturnal hypoxia may increase the success rate of standard AF treatment.","Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) (a sleep disorder of recurring episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep) is one of the causes of atrial fibrillation (AF) (a fluttery and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots or stroke). The occurrence of AF is high in SAHS-diagnosed patients. Nocturnal hypoxemia (a temporary drop in oxygen while sleeping) is associated with AF, pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure affecting the arteries in the lungs and heart), and nocturnal death (death in sleep caused by sudden cardiac death). The frequency of AF recurring is high in people with untreated SAHS after cardioversion, a procedure used to return an irregular or very fast heartbeat to a normal rhythm. This study summarizes the case of a patient with SAHS diagnosed by an apnea test (monitoring of breathing and oxygen) and who did not develop recurring (chronic) atrial fibrillation after receiving standard treatment and the bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), a ventilator used to maintain a consistent breathing pattern (often used at night). A 57-year old male patient who was on treatment for 1.5 months for AF was admitted to the hospital because of a high, irregular heart beat. The sinus rhythm (the pattern of your heartbeat based on the sinus node of your heart which sends out electrical pulses) was steady during the cardioversion procedure. Heart and oxygen tests were performed in the hospital after the second cardioversion. The patient was sent home with medical treatment and a nocturnal BiPAP. No recurring atrial fibrillation developed in the patient, and his medical treatment was reduced within 6 months. After gastric bypass surgery on the 12th month, nocturnal hypoxia and atrial fibrillation did not re-occur. Because they did not recur, the BiPAP and medical treatments were ended. In conclusion, SAHS can be diagnosed by performing an apnea test in the hospital. SAHS should be investigated in patients developing recurring atrial fibrillation after a cardioversion procedure. Recovery of nocturnal hypoxia may increase the success of standard atrial fibrillation treatment.",
11,31161145,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder associated with abnormal mitochondrial metabolism. Structural brain abnormalities are common in PDCD. A case of a patient with PDCD with an unusual presentation is described. A 20-month-old boy with hypotonia and developmental delay, presented with hypoxia and respiratory distress due to bronchiolitis. During hospitalisation, he was prescribed PediaSure® feeds. Two days after starting these feeds, he developed respiratory arrest requiring intubation. His blood gas before arrest revealed lactate of 8.9 mmol/L despite normal haemodynamics. After stabilisation and a period of compulsory fasting, subsequent feeding with PediaSure® resulted in the recurrence of lactic acidosis. A metabolic workup revealed an elevated serum pyruvate level. Brain MRI was normal. Skeletal muscle biopsy confirmed PDCD. The most common cause of PDCD is a mutation in the X-linked PDHA1 gene. The severity of PDCD can range from neonatal death to more delayed onset of symptoms as in our index case. Normal brain MRI is reported in only 2% of patients with PDCD. There is no effective treatment for PDCD.

While in the hospital, he was prescribed PediaSure® feeds, a child formula or nutritional food product. Two days after starting these feeds, he stopped breathing and needed a tube inserted in his throat to help him breathe.

45,29295637,"Aims: To describe the utilization of clostridial collagenase ointment (CCO) and medicinal honey debridement methods in real-world inpatient and outpatient hospital settings among pressure ulcer (PU) patients and compare the frequency of healthcare re-encounters between CCO- and medicinal honey-treated patients. Materials and methods: De-identified hospital discharge records for patients receiving CCO or medicinal honey methods of debridement and having an ICD-9 code for PU were extracted from the US Premier Healthcare Database. Multivariable analysis was used to compare the frequency of inpatient and outpatient revisits up to 6 months after an index encounter for CCO- vs medicinal honey-treated PUs. Results: The study identified 48,267 inpatients and 2,599 outpatients with PUs treated with CCO or medicinal honeys. Among study inpatients, n = 44,725 (93%) were treated with CCO, and n = 3,542 (7%) with medicinal honeys. CCO and medicinal honeys accounted for 1,826 (70%) and 773 (30%), respectively, of study outpatients. In adjusted models, those treated with CCO had lower odds for inpatient readmissions (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.80-0.94) after inpatient index visits, and outpatient re-encounters both after inpatient (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.67-0.79) and outpatient (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.64-0.95) index visits in 6 months of follow-up. Limitations: The study was observational in nature, and did not adjust for reasons why patients were hospitalized initially, or why they returned to the facility. Although the study adjusted for differences in a variety of demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics between the treatments, we are not able to rule out selection bias. Conclusion: Patients with CCO-treated PUs returned to inpatient and outpatient hospital settings less often compared with medicinal honey-treated PUs. These results from real-world administrative data help to gain a better understanding of the clinical characteristics of patients with PUs treated with these two debridement methods and the economic implications of debridement choice in the acute care setting.","We aim to describe the use of clostridial collagenase ointment (CCO - a medication with special proteins) and medical honey to remove damaged tissue in hospitals among bedsore patients and compare how often CCO- and medical honey-treated patients return to the hospital. We obtained hospital discharge records from a national database for patients getting CCO or medical honey methods of removing damaged tissues with an official diagnosis of bedsores. We used statistical models to compare how often patients who did and did not stay at least one night in the hospital returned to the hospital up to 6 months after bedsore treatment with either CCO or medical honey. We looked at 48,267 and 2,599 patients with bedsores treated with CCO or medicine honeys who did and did not stay at least one night at the hospital, respectively. CCO and medical honeys made up 44,725 (93%) and 3,542 (7%), respectively, of people who stayed at least one night in the hospital. CCO and medical honeys made up 1,826 (70%) and 773 (30%), respectively, of people who did not stay a night in the hospital. Based on models, patients treated with CCO were less likely to be readmitted to the hospital after being admitted, and to return to the hospital but not stay a night after either going to the hospital and staying or not staying at least one night over the following 6 months. Study limitations included not considering why patients were hospitalized or why they returned to the hospital. Even though we took into account differences in many population, clinical, and hospital characteristics between the treatments, the study population may have not been completely random. We conclude that bedsore patients treated with CCO returned to the hospital less often than those treated with medical honey. These results based on real-world data help us better understand treatment characteristics of bedsore patients related with these two days to remove damaged tissue and connect to method costs related to short-term care.",

Gabapentin is not bound to plasma proteins, does not induce hepatic enzymes and is not metabolized. At steady state, it has a half-life of 6-8 h, and is eliminated unchanged by renal route with a plasma clearance proportional to the creatinine clearance. It is devoid of significant drug-drug interactions when administered with the established AEDs or with oral contraceptives. Gabapentin used as an add-on AED significantly reduced the frequency of partial seizures and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures in three large double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trails. It is well tolerated, with transient somnolence and dizziness being the most frequent adverse effects. Although the mechanism of action of gabapentin is not fully established, there is strong evidence to suggest a novel mechanism of action.

Normally, half of the drug is eliminated in 6-8 hours. It is cleared unchanged by the kidney with a blood clearance similar to standard kidney substance clearance. The drug does not have major drug-drug interactions when used with other AEDs or swallowed birth control drugs. Gabapentin used as an add-on AED greatly reduces the amount of partial seizures and partial seizures developing into standard serizures in three clinical trials.

It is absorbed into the body by an active and fluid-filled transport system, and is able to be distributed to tissues in the body. Gabapentin is not attached to proteins in the blood, does not create liver enzymes that can speed up chemical reactions in the body, and is not broken down. When the amount of the drug in the body is the same amount that is being cleared, the time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma or body to be reduced by half is 6-8 hours and is eliminated through the kidneys. Gabapentin does not have any major interactions with other drugs when given with other standard drugs that treat seizures or with oral (by mouth) birth control. In 3 clinical studies, gabapentin used as an add-on anti-seizure drug to assist the main treatment reduces the frequency of partial seizures (impacting half the brain) and seizures (impacting both halves of the brain).

Although the exact process of how gabapentin can lead to an effect is not fully understood, there is strong evidence that suggests a new process in the body. Gabapentin is a unique and promising drug that could improve the quality of life of patients with epilepsy (seizure disorders) and is a welcome addition to currently available drugs for the treatment of patients with seizures that start in one part of the brain."
45,34408570,"Introduction: Treatment of decubitus ulcers is a grave medical problem. In many cases, it is difficult to cure a pressure ulcer, especially when it is deep and extensive, and prognosis is usually unfavourable. Treatment of decubitus ulcers requires new specialist dressings, which play an important role in the healing process. Aim: To evaluate therapeutic efficacy of active specialist medical dressings in the treatment of decubitus. Material and methods: Research involved 40 patients - 18 (45%) women and 22 (55%) men, suffering from decubitus ulcers of different size and depth, localized in the sacral region, lasting from 1.5 to 30 months. Patients were randomly assigned to two research groups (20 people each), were treated for 4 weeks with 2 different specialist dressings. ATRAUMAN Ag, which contains silver ions, was used in the first group, while paraffin gauze of BACTIGRAS type was used in the second group. An assessment of pressure ulcers' healing progress was done with a planimetric method, which evaluates the wound surface area. Results: The analysis results showed a significant statistical decrease in an average decubitus ulcer surface area in both research groups: in the first group by 60.2% (p = 0.001), and in the second group by 32.95% (p < 0.001), which speaks in favour of dressings with silver ions as having better therapeutic effectiveness. Conclusions: Using specialist dressings results in a significant decrease in the decubitus ulcer surface area, depending on the type of dressing and active substances contained within, while silver ions support curative effectiveness of the dressing used.","Treatment of bedsores is a serious medical problem. Often, a bedsore is hard to cure, especially when it is deep and covers a large area, and usually has a poor prognosis (plan for recovery). Treating bedsores requires specialized dressings, which play an important role in the healing process. We aim to rate how well active specialized dressings, which promote healing by keeping the wound moist, work to treat bedsores. We looked at 40 patients, 18 (45%) women and 22 (55%) men, with bedsores differing in size and depth, located near the bottom of the spine, lasting from 1.5 to 3.0 months. We randomly assigned patients to two groups of 20 people each and treated them with two different specialist dressings for 4 weeks. We used ATRAUMAN ag, which contains silver ions, in the first group and paraffin (waxy) gauze of BACTIGRAS type in the second group. We measured the progress of bedsore healing by measuring the wound's boundaries, which calculates the surface area. Results showed average bedsore surface area significantly decreased in the first group by 60.2% and in the second group by 32.95%, suggesting dressings with silver ions worked better. We conclude that specialist dressings significantly decrease bedsore surface area, and dressings with silver ions work better than those without.","Treating decubitus ulcers (bedsores) is a serious medical problem. In many cases, it is difficult to cure a pressure ulcer or bedsore, especially when it is deep and extensive. Recovery is usually poor.

48,34618348,"Introduction: Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) selectively restores disturbances of regulatory T cells (Treg) and conventional T cells, resulting in the induction of remission in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. However, to date no research has been carried out on the efficacy of low-dose IL-2 in the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis (LN). The aim of the study reported here was to investigate the renal response to low-dose IL-2 in patients with refractory LN. Methods: The study population comprised ten patients with refractory LN who failed to achieve complete response or who had relapsed while being treated with at least two conventional immunosuppressive agents. One treatment cycle consisted of IL-2 at a dose of 1 million IU administered subcutaneously every other day for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week break. All patients received three cycles of IL-2 and were then followed up for another 12 weeks without any increase in the dose of previous immunosuppressive agents and steroids. Results: Of the ten patients enrolled in the study, seven (70%) achieved ≥ 50% improvement in proteinuria at 12 weeks after initiating treatment with IL-2. Median proteinuria was significantly reduced by 50.3% at week 12, from 1.83 (interquartile range [IQR] 1.23-3.21) g/24 h at baseline to 0.91 (IQR 0.52-1.60) g/24 h at 12 weeks (P = 0.005). This was accompanied by a 71% reduction in urine erythrocytes, from 64/µl (IQR 24-102/µl) at baseline to 18/µl (IQR 2-20/µl) at 12 weeks (P = 0.018). Anti-ds DNA was decreased from 27.9 (IQR 7.6-40.28) IU/ml at baseline to 14.1 (IQR 7.3-20.12) IU/ml (P = 0.021) at week 12, while complements C3 and C4 were slightly increased (P = 0.445, P = 0.241, respectively). A significant expansion of Treg cells, from 9.3% at baseline to 16.6% at 12 weeks, was also found (P < 0.05). No serious adverse events occurred during the treatment period. Conclusions: Low-dose IL-2 therapy may have a promising role in the treatment of refractory LN as an alternative and safe therapeutic approach. It may be used as multi-target combination therapy in clinical practice.","Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a type of protein that promotes and develops immune cells at the start of an immune response and keeps them alive. A low-dose of interleukin-2 can restore changes of immune cells called T cells and Treg cells, resulting in the start of remission (recovery) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells). However, to date, no research has been carried out on the effectiveness of low-dose IL-2 in the treatment of lupus nephritis, a type of kidney disease caused by lupus. The aim of this study is to investigate the kidney response to low-dose IL-2 in patients with lupus nephritis that is not responding to standard treatment. The study includes 10 patients with lupus nephritis who failed to achieve a complete response to standard treatment or who improved and then worsened while being treated with at least two standard treatments. One treatment cycle consists of IL-2 given by an injection every other day for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week break. All patients receive three cycles of IL-2 and are then followed up for another 12 weeks without any increase in the dose of the previous treatments or steroids. Of the 10 patients enrolled in the study, 7 (70%) achieved 50% or more improvement in proteinuria (elevated levels of protein in the urine) at 12 weeks after starting IL-2 treatment. Average proteinuria is significantly reduced by 50.3% at week 12. There is also a 71% decrease in red blood cells in urine at 12 weeks. An antibody (infection-fighting molecule) associated with lupus called anti-ds DNA decreased from the start of the study to week 12, while protein complements C3 and C4 used to monitor the immune systems are slightly increased. A significant expansion of the immune Treg cells, from 9.3% at the start of the study to 16.6% at 12 weeks, is also found. No serious negative events occurred while patients receive the treatment. In conclusion, low-dose IL-2 therapy may have a promising role in the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis as an alternative and safe treatment approach. Low-dose IL-2 may be used in combination with other medicines in clinical practice.",
25,34547765,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated clinical benefit in cases of mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection, substantially reducing the risk for hospitalization and severe disease 1-4. Treatment generally requires the administration of high doses of these mAbs with limited efficacy in preventing disease complications or mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients 5. Here we report the development and evaluation of Fc-optimized anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs with superior potency to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease. In several animal models of COVID-19 disease we demonstrate that selective engagement of activating FcγRs results in improved efficacy in both preventing and treating disease-induced weight loss and mortality, significantly reducing the dose required to confer full protection upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge and treatment of pre-infected animals. Our results highlight the importance of FcγR pathways in driving antibody-mediated antiviral immunity, while excluding any pathogenic or disease-enhancing effects of FcγR engagement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies upon infection. These findings have important implications for the development of Fc-engineered mAbs with optimal Fc effector function and improved clinical efficacy against COVID-19 disease.","Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that can make the coronavirus ineffective and have shown to be beneficial in cases of mild to moderate coronavirus infection, substantially reducing the risk for staying in the hospital and having severe symptoms of the disease.

This study reports on the development and evaluation of monoclonal antibodies enhanced with the Fc (the part of the antibody that helps interactions with other cells) to prevent or treat COVID-19. In several animal studies of COVID-19, researchers show that activating certain parts of the Fc proteins results in improvements in both preventing and treating weight loss and death from the disease. This helps reduce the dose required to gain full protection in animals who are not infected with the coronavirus. Results highlight the importance of the Fc proteins in increasing immunity to the virus. These findings may influence the development of Fc monoclonal antibodies with improved functions to help strengthen immunity against COVID-19.",
44,28346013,"Development of a human model of hemorrhage has provided a unique opportunity to investigate the underlying physiology that defines the individual capacity to avoid the life-threatening clinical condition of inadequate tissue oxygenation known as “shock.” The experimental approach of progressively reducing central blood volume to the point of hemodynamic decompensation with the use of lower body negative pressure has revealed stark distinctions in the physiological compensatory responses between individuals with high compared with low tolerances to blood loss. High tolerance to hemorrhage is defined by a capacity to maintain systemic perfusion pressure and reduce the rate of cerebral hypoperfusion by: (1) protecting cardiac output with greater elevations in heart rate associated with greater cardiac vagal withdrawal and sympathetically mediated adrenergic stimulation; (2) greater increases in systemic peripheral vascular resistance associated with higher sympathetic nerve activation and levels of circulating vasopressor endocrine responses; (3) alternating blood flow between the brain and peripheral tissue with greater sympathetically mediated oscillatory patterns of systemic pressure and flow; and (4) enhancing cardiac filling and cerebral perfusion pressure gradient by optimizing the respiratory pump. When the capacity for these compensatory responses is exhausted, an active vasodilation drops resistance to blood flow allowing for increased perfusion of peripheral tissue. When cardiac filling is no longer adequate to maintain systemic pressure and flow, a reflex-mediated pronounced bradycardia leads to the initiation of decompensatory shock.","A human model of hemorrhage (excessive bleeding) provides the opportunity to investigate the underlying mechanisms that can help someone avoid the life-threatening condition of inadequate tissue oxygenation known as ""shock."" This is completed by experimentally reducing central blood volume. Blood volume is progressively decreased to the point of critically low blood pressure. This test approach has shown differences in the bodily responses between individuals with high tolerances versus low tolerances to blood loss. High tolerance to hemorrhage is defined by maintaining body wide blood flow pressure and prevent decreased brain blood pressure. This is done by one of four ways. First, by protecting cardiac output with greater elevations in heart rate associated with greater cardiac vagal withdrawal and sympathetically mediated adrenergic stimulation. Second, a greater increases in systemic peripheral vascular resistance (blood vessel resistance) associated with higher sympathetic nerve activation (fight-or-flight reaction) and levels of circulating vasopressor endocrine responses (responses from chemical messengers). Third, an alternating blood flow between the brain and peripheral tissue with greater sympathetically mediated oscillatory patterns of systemic pressure and flow. Lastly, by enhancing cardiac filling and cerebral perfusion pressure gradient (pressure driving oxygen to brain tissue) by optimizing the respiratory pump (muscles that help the lung extract and contract). When these compensatory responses are exhausted, an active vasodilation (enlargement of blood vessels) drops resistance to blood flow allowing for increased perfusion of peripheral tissue. When the body no is longer able to maintain systemic pressure and flow, a decreased heart rate leads to the initiation of decompensatory shock.",
15,31082167,"Potassium is mainly an intracellular ion. The sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase pump has the primary responsibility for regulating the homeostasis between sodium and potassium, which pumps out sodium in exchange for potassium, which moves into the cells. In the kidneys, the filtration of potassium takes place at the glomerulus. The reabsorption of potassium takes place at the proximal convoluted tubule and thick ascending loop of Henle. Potassium secretion occurs at the distal convoluted tubule. Aldosterone increases potassium secretion. Potassium channels and potassium-chloride cotransporters at the apical membrane also secrete potassium. Potassium disorders are related to cardiac arrhythmias. Hypokalemia occurs when serum potassium levels under 3.6 mmol/L—weakness, fatigue, and muscle twitching present in hypokalemia.","Potassium is mainly an ion (an atom or molecule that carries an electrical charge) within a body of water within cells.

53,12713453,"Background: In diabetic patients, postprandial glucose levels, which have a major impact on metabolic control, are determined by the rate of nutrient delivery into the intestine, absorption of nutrients from the small intestine, and the metabolism of the absorbed nutrients by the liver. The present study addresses whether Type 1 diabetic patients have increased intestinal permeability and intestinal permeability predicts postprandial glucose variability. Material and methods: Thirty Type 1 diabetic patients together with 15 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. After an overnight fasting all patients and controls received 100 micro Ci 51 Cr of EDTA as a radioactive tracer and the percentage of the isotope excreted in a 24-h urinary specimen was the permeability measure. Instant blood glucose was measured just before the test, and the patients performed and recorded self-monitoring of fasting and 2nd-hour postprandial blood glucose levels during the following week. Results: We found that intestinal permeability is increased in Type 1 diabetic patients compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Increased intestinal permeability is related at least in part to the instant blood glucose level and the presence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Conclusion: Increased intestinal permeability leads to higher variation in postprandial blood glucose levels, thereby worsening metabolic control.","In diabetic patients, blood sugar levels after meals, which have a major impact on how nutrients in the body are used, are determined by several factors: the rate of nutrient delivery into the stomach, absorption of nutrients from the small intestine that helps further digestion of food, and the metabolism of the nutrients absorbed by the liver. The present study addresses whether Type 1 diabetic patients have increased intestinal permeability, the control of material passing from the stomach and to the rest of the body, and how intestinal permeability predicts different levels of blood sugar after meals. Thirty Type 1 diabetic patients and 15 healthy people as controls (comparison group) are enrolled in the study. After an overnight fasting (no food), all patients and controls receive a substance called EDTA that allows internal images of the body to be seen, and the amount of the substance released in a 24-hour urine sample is how intestinal permeability is measured. During the following week, instant blood sugar is measured just before the test, and the patients performed and recorded self-monitoring of fasting and blood sugar levels 2 hours after meals. Researchers found that intestinal permeability is increased in Type 1 diabetic patients compared with healthy controls. Increased intestinal permeability is related at least in part to the instant blood sugar level and the presence of a type of nerve damage that can occur with diabetes. Increased intestinal permeability that allows substances to pass from the stomach to the body leads to higher differences in post-meal blood sugar levels, thereby worsening the body's ability to control the use and distribution of nutrients.",
19,32844196,"The natural pattern of progression of Parkinson's disease is largely unknown because patients are conventionally followed on treatment. As Parkinson's disease progresses, the true magnitude of the long-duration response to levodopa remains unknown, because it can only be estimated indirectly in treated patients. We aimed to describe the natural course of motor symptoms by assessing the natural OFF in consecutive Parkinson's disease patients never exposed to treatment (drug-naïve), and to investigate the effects of daily levodopa on the progression of motor disability in the OFF medication state over a 2-year period. In this prospective naturalistic study in sub-Saharan Africa, 30 Parkinson's disease patients (age at onset 58 ± 14 years, disease duration 7 ± 4 years) began levodopa monotherapy and were prospectively assessed using the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Data were collected at baseline, at 1-year and 2-years follow-up. First-ever levodopa intake induced a significant improvement in motor symptoms (natural OFF versus ON state UPDRS-III 41.9 ± 15.9 versus 26.8 ± 15.1, respectively; P < 0.001). At 1-year follow-up, OFF state UPDRS-III score after overnight withdrawal of levodopa was considerably lower than natural OFF (26.5 ± 14.9; P < 0 .001). This effect was not modified by disease duration. At the 2-year follow-up, motor signs after overnight OFF (30.2 ± 14.2) were still 30% milder than natural OFF (P = 0.001). The ON state UPDRS-III at the first-ever levodopa challenge was similar to the overnight OFF score at 1-year follow-up and the two conditions were correlated (r = 0.72, P < 0.001). Compared to the natural progression of motor disability, levodopa treatment resulted in a 31% lower annual decline in UPDRS-III scores in the OFF state (3.33 versus 2.30 points/year) with a lower model's variance explained by disease duration (67% versus 36%). Using the equation regressed on pretreatment data, we predicted the natural OFF at 1-year and 2-year follow-up visits and estimated that the magnitude of the long-duration response to levodopa ranged between 60% and 65% of total motor benefit provided by levodopa, independently of disease duration (P = 0.13). Although levodopa therapy was associated with motor fluctuations, overnight OFF disability during levodopa was invariably less severe than the natural course of the disease, independently of disease duration. The same applies to the yearly decline in UPDRS-III scores in the OFF state. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the long-duration response to levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Understanding the natural course of Parkinson's disease and the long-duration response to levodopa may help to develop therapeutic strategies increasing its magnitude to improve patient quality of life and to better interpret the outcome of randomized clinical trials on disease-modifying therapies that still rely on the overnight OFF to define Parkinson's disease progression.","The natural development of Parkinson's disease (a brain disorder that affects movement and coordination) is largely unknown because patients are usually evaluated while on treatment. As Parkinson's disease progresses, the true impact of the long-term response to levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) remains unknown because it can only be estimated indirectly in treated patients. Researchers aimed to describe the natural progression of motor (movement) symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and slowness of movement by evaluating the natural OFF state (when symptoms return) in patients with Parkinson's disease who have never taken drugs to treat the disease. Researchers also aimed to investigate the effects of daily levodopa on the progression of motor disability (partial or total loss of movement in part of the body) in the OFF medication state over a 2-year period. In this study in sub-Saharan Africa, 30 Parkinson's disease patients started levodopa and are assessed using the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a rating tool used to measure the severity and progression of Parkinson's disease in patients. Data are collected at the start of the study and at 1-year and 2-year follow-up appointments. Taking levodopa for the first time has a significant improvement in motor symptoms. At 1-year follow-up, OFF state (when symptoms return) UPDRS-III score after overnight withdrawal of levodopa was considerably lower than natural OFF. This effect does not change based on how long the person has the disease. At the 2-year follow-up, motor signs after overnight OFF are still milder than natural OFF. The ON state (patient feels energetic and can move) UPDRS-III at the first-ever levodopa challenge is similar to the overnight OFF score at 1-year follow-up, and the two conditions are connected. Compared to the natural progression of motor disability, levodopa treatment resulted in a lower annual decline in UPDRS-III scores in the OFF state with a lower number than expected, which is explained by disease duration. Using data taken from before treatment started, researchers made predictions of the natural OFF at 1-year and 2-year follow-up visits and estimated that the magnitude of how long patients have a response to levodopa ranged between 60% and 65% of benefit on motor ability provided by levodopa, independently of how long patients had the disease. Although levodopa is linked to changes in motor ability, overnight OFF disability (when symptoms return) during levodopa is less severe than the natural course of the disease, independently of how long patients had the disease. The same applies to the yearly decline in UPDRS-III scores in the OFF state. Further research is needed to clarify the processes underlying the long-duration response to levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Understanding the natural course of Parkinson's disease and how long motor improvements last while on levodopa may help to develop treatment strategies, increasing its impact to improve patient quality of life and to better understand the outcome of clinical studies on therapies that still rely on the overnight OFF to define Parkinson's disease progression.","The natural progress of Parkinson's disease (a brain-related disorder affecting movement) is largely unknown because patients are usually examined during treatment. As Parkinson's disease progresses, the effect of the long-lasting response to levodopa (common Parkinsons's medication) remains unknown since it is measured indirectly in treated patients. We tried to describe the natural course of movement symptoms by measuring the OFF state when symptoms occur in patients never given treatment (drug-naïve) for Parkinson's disease. For 2 years, we also explored how daily levodopa affects the progression of movement symptoms in the OFF state after treatment wears off. In this lengthy, observational study in sub-Saharan Africa, 30 patients with Parkinson's disease (age at onset 58 ± 14 years, disease duration 7 ± 4 years) began levodopa therapy and were later measured with a specific disease scale for Parkinson's. Data were collected at start, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up. First-time levodopa intake improved movement symptoms. After 1 year, severity of symptoms of Parkinson's disease was lower after overnight withdrawal of levodopa than without it at all. The lowered severity by levodopa was not altered by disease length. After 2 years, movement signs after overnight withdrawal of medication was still 30% milder than movement signs with no treatment ever. The no-symptom state after first-time levodopa was similar and related to the overnight typical-symptom state after 1 year. Compared to the natural progression, levodopa reduces symptom severity via a 31% annual decline with some leeway due to disease duration. We calculated that the response to levodopa involved a possible 60-65% benefit of total motor activity, regardless of disease duration. While levodopa relates to movement fluctuations, the typical-symptom state after overnight levodopa withdrawal was less severe than without medication at all, regardless of disease duration. A yearly decline in symptom severity during the typical-symptom state also exists. We need more research to explain the mechanisms for the response to levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Understanding how Parkinson's disease progresses and the response to levodopa may help create better treatments and better assess clinical trials for Parkinson's disease."

The faulty protein is degraded before reaching the cell membrane, where it needs to be to effect transepithelial salt transport.

48,34659263,"As treatment options in advanced systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are limited, there is an urgent need for new and effective therapeutic alternatives for selected cases with severe disease. Bortezomib (BTZ) is a specific, reversible, inhibitor of the 20S subunit of the proteasome. Herein, we report clinical experience regarding efficacy and safety from all patients receiving BTZ as therapy for SLE in Sweden during the years 2014-2020. 8 females and 4 males were included with a mean disease duration at BTZ initiation of 8.8 years (range 0.7-20 years). Renal involvement was the main target for BTZ. Reduction of global disease activity was recorded by decreasing SLEDAI-2K scores over time and remained significantly reduced at the 6-month (p=0.007) and the 12-month (p=0.008) follow-up visits. From BTZ initiation, complement protein 3 (C3) levels increased significantly after the 2nd treatment cycle (p=0.05), the 6-month (p=0.03) and the 12-month (p=0.04) follow-up visits. The urine albumin/creatinine ratio declined over time and reached significance at the 6-month (p=0.008) and the 12-month follow-up visits (p=0.004). Seroconversion of anti-dsDNA (27%), anti-C1q (50%) and anti-Sm (67%) was observed. 6 of 12 patients experienced at least one side-effect during follow-up, whereof the most common adverse events were infections. Safety parameters (C-reactive protein, blood cell counts) mainly remained stable over time. To conclude, we report favorable therapeutic effects of BTZ used in combination with corticosteroids in a majority of patients with severe SLE manifestations irresponsive to conventional immunosuppressive agents. Reduction of proteinuria was observed over time as well as seroconversion of some autoantibody specificities. In most patients, tolerance was acceptable but mild adverse events was not uncommon. Special attention should be paid to infections and hypogammaglobinemia.","Because treatment options in advanced systematic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells) are limited, there is an urgent need for new and effective treatment alternatives for selected cases with severe disease. Bortezomib (BTZ) is a specific, reversible drug that stops the function of the protein complex called proteasome that breaks down unneeded or damaged proteins. This study reports the effectiveness and safety of all patients receiving BTZ for lupus in Sweden during 2014-2020. Eight females and 4 males are included with an average disease duration of 8.8 years when BZT is started. Kidney involvement was the main target for BTZ. Reduction of global disease activity is recorded by decreasing scores over time of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI-2K) that tracks disease activity and remained significantly reduced at the 6-month and the 12-month follow-up visits. From BTZ initiation, levels of a protein that supports the immune system called complement protein 3 (C3) increased significantly after the 2nd treatment cycle, the 6-month, and the 12-month follow-up visits. The urine test showing albumin protein in urine declined over time and reduced significantly at the 6-month and the 12-month follow-up visits. The presence of certain antibodies (infecting-fighting molecules) related to lupus is observed. Six out of 12 patients experienced at least one side-effect during follow-up, the most common adverse events are infections. Tests to measure safety, including blood cell counts, mainly remained stable over time. In conclusion, researchers found beneficial effects of BTZ when used in combination with corticosteroids (an anti-inflammatory drug also known as steroids) in most patients with severe lupus who do not respond to the standard treatments. Reduction of proteinuria (elevated protein in urine) was observed over time as well as changes to specific antibodies. In most patients, the side effects were tolerable but mild adverse events were not uncommon. Special attention should be paid to infections and low levels of antibodies.",
46,30349480,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and remains the most common life-shortening diseases affecting the exocrine organs. The absence of this channel results in an imbalance of ion concentrations across the cell membrane and results in more abnormal secretion and mucus plugging in the gastrointestinal tract and in the lungs of CF patients. The direct introduction of fully functional CFTR by gene therapy has long been pursued as a therapeutical option to restore CFTR function independent of the specific CFTR mutation, but the different clinical trials failed to propose persuasive evidence of this strategy. The last ten years has led to the development of new pharmacotherapies which can activate CFTR function in a mutation-specific manner. Although approximately 2,000 different disease-associated mutations have been identified, a single codon deletion, F508del, is by far the most common and is present on at least one allele in approximately 70% of the patients in CF populations. This strategy is limited by chemistry, the knowledge on CFTR and the heterogenicity of the patients. New research efforts in CF aim to develop other therapeutical approaches to combine different strategies. Targeting RNA appears as a new and an important opportunity to modulate dysregulated biological processes. Abnormal miRNA activity has been linked to numerous diseases, and over the last decade, the critical role of miRNA in regulating biological processes has fostered interest in how miRNA binds to and interacts explicitly with the target protein. Herein, this review describes the different strategies to identify dysregulated miRNA opens up a new concept and new opportunities to correct CFTR deficiency. This review describes therapeutic applications of antisense techniques currently under investigation in CF.","Changes in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common life-shortening diseases affecting organs that make and release substances into transporting ducts. The absence of this protein from the CFTR gene causes an imbalance of ion (charged atom) concentrations across the cell membrane and causes release and buildup of abnormally high levels of mucus in the digestive tract and lungs of CF patients. Scientists have tried transferring working CFTR into a patient's cells regardless of the specific CFTR gene change, but patient trials were not successful. New drugs that can stimulate CFTR function based on the specific gene change have been made in the last ten years. Of the roughly 2,000 different gene changes linked to CF, the most common change is F508del, a deletion of a sequence of three consecutive gene compounds, and about 70% of people with CF have at least one form of it. Chemistry, CFTR knowledge, and genetic differences of patients limit the ability to stimulate CFTR function based on the specific gene change. New CF research aims to develop other treatments that combine different approaches. Looking at RNA (which changes the genetic information of DNA into proteins) is a new and important chance to fix incorrectly functioning biological processes. Scientists have linked abnormal microRNA (miRNA; short type of non-coding RNA that does not encode a protein) to many diseases, and over the last decade, scientists have developed interest in how miRNA interacts with specific proteins. We describe different ways to find incorrectly functioning miRNA that might help correct lack of CFTR. This review describes RNA treatments currently being studied in CF.",

We investigated the effect of aging and cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ1-42 and tau on 1) frontal metabolites measured with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and 2) cognition in cognitively normal older adults (n = 144; age range 50-85). Levels of frontal gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA+) and myo-inositol relative to creatine (mI/tCr) were predicted by age. Levels of GABA+ predicted cognitive performance better than mI/tCr. Additionally, we found that frontal levels of n-acetylaspartate relative to creatine (tNAA/tCr) were predicted by levels of t-tau. In cognitively normal older adults, levels of frontal GABA+ and mI/t Cr are predicted by aging, with levels of GABA+ decreasing with age and the opposite for mI/tCr. These results suggest that age- and biomarker-related changes in brain metabolites are not only located in the posterior cortex as suggested by previous studies and further demonstrate that MRS is a viable tool in the study of aging and biomarkers associated with pathological aging and Alzheimer's disease.","Increased expression of β-amyloid (Aβ1-42) and tau proteins are considered risk-factors for Alzheimer's disease in healthy older adults. Aβ1-42 is a protein deposited in organs, clumps referred to as plaques, during certain diseases. Tau proteins are proteins that stabilizes microtubules or structures within cells. This paper investigated the effect of aging and cerebrospinal (brain and spine) fluid levels of Aβ1-42 and tau on two health endpoints. These endpoints include evaluating frontal metabolites with a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and cognition (thinking ability) in cognitively normal older adults. Levels of a neurotransmitter (a signaling molecule) known as gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA+) were predicted by age. Levels of myo-inositol relative to creatine (mI/tCr), a ratio of two metabolites in the brain often used to determine disease state, were predicted by age. Levels of GABA+ predicted cognitive performance better than mI/tCr. Additionally, frontal levels of n-acetyl aspartate, another brain metabolite, relative to creatine (tNAA/tCr) were predicted by levels of t-tau, the protein. In cognitively normal older adults, levels of frontal GABA+ and mI/t Cr are predicted by aging. Levels of GABA+ decreased with age. Levels of mI/tCr increased with age. These results suggest that age- and biomarker-related changes in brain metabolites are not only located in the posterior cortex. Additionally, these studies demonstrate that MRS is a viable tool to study aging and aging biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease.","Increased amounts of β-amyloid (Aβ1-42) and tau, biological proteins, are considered risk factors for Alzheimer's disease in healthy, older adults. We tested the effect of aging and Aβ1-42 and tau amounts in brain and spine fluid on 1) energy molecules in the front of the brain and 2) reasoning skills in 144 older adults. Levels of specific chemical signal molecules (GABA+) and sugars (mI/tCr) in the brain were linked to age. Levels of the GABA+ trended with reasoning skills better than Mi/tCr. We found that levels of a specific chemical molecule were linked to levels of t-tau. In normal older adults, the specific chemical signal molecule GABA+ decreased with age while the chemical sugar mI/tCR increased with age. Age- and biomarker-related changes in brain molecules are not only located in the back of the brain as other studies show and that using a radio-wave tool can help study aging and biomarkers linked with aging diseases and Alzheimer's."
33,33118231,"Aims: Gabapentin (GBP) is widely used to treat neuropathic pain, including diabetic neuropathic pain. Our objective was to evaluate the role of diabetes and glycaemic control on GBP population pharmacokinetics. Methods: A clinical trial was conducted in patients with neuropathic pain (n = 29) due to type 2 diabetes (n = 19) or lumbar/cervical disc herniation (n = 10). All participants were treated with a single oral dose GBP. Blood was sampled up to 24 hours after GBP administration. Data were analysed with a population approach using the stochastic approximation expectation maximization algorithm. Weight, body mass index, sex, biomarkers of renal function and diabetes, and genotypes for the main genetic polymorphisms of SLC22A2 (rs316019) and SLC22A4 (rs1050152), the genes encoding the transporters for organic cations OCT2 and OCTN1, were tested as potential covariates. Results: GBP drug disposition was described by a 1-compartment model with lag-time, first-order absorption and linear elimination. The total clearance was dependent on estimated glomerular filtration rate. Population estimates (between-subject variability in percentage) for lag time, first-order absorption rate, apparent volume of distribution and total clearance were 0.316 h (10.6%), 1.12 h-1 (10.7%), 140 L (7.7%) and 14.7 L/h (6.97%), respectively. No significant association was observed with hyperglycaemia, glycated haemoglobin, diabetes diagnosis, age, sex, weight, body mass index, SLC22A2 or SLC22 A4 genotypes. Conclusion: This population pharmacokinetics model accurately estimated GBP concentrations in patients with neuropathic pain, using estimated glomerular filtrationrate as a covariate for total clearance. The distribution and excretion processes of GBP were not affected by hyperglycaemia or diabetes.","Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the nervous system (like brain and spinal cord) and is often described as a shooting pain, burning sensation, or numbness. Gabapentin is a common medication used to treat neuropathic pain, including neuropathic pain caused by diabetes. The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of diabetes and controlling blood sugar on people taking gabapentin. A clinical trial is conducted in patients with neuropathic pain due to type 2 diabetes (19 people) or a slipped disc in the neck or spine (10 people). All participants are treated with a single dose of gabapentin by mouth. Blood is sampled up to 24 hours after gabapentin is given. Data are analyzed using computer models. Other information are included in the model including weight, sex, kidney functions and other changes in genes that impact how the medication works. The total clearance of gabapentin from the body depends on how well the kidneys are able to process and filter the drug. The estimated total clearance of the drug (completely removed) in the population is 14.7 liters per hour. No major association is found with having high blood sugar levels, a diabetes diagnosis, or with age, sex, weight or other factors evaluated. This model studying how the drug is processed in the body estimates gabapentin concentrations in patients with neuropathic pain. The distribution and clearance processes of gabapentin are not affected by having high blood sugar levels or diabetes.","Gabapentin (GBP), an antiseizure drug, can treat neuropathic or nerve-related pain, including diabetic neuropathic pain. We evaluate the role of diabetes and blood sugar control on drug activity in the GBP population. A trial was done in 29 patients with neuropathic pain, 19 from type 2 diabetes and 10 from lower back/neck disc herniation or bulging. All participants swallowed a single dose of GBP. Blood was taken up to 24 hours after GBP treatment.   Measurements for lag time, absorption rate, volume of distribution, and clearance rate were 0.316 h (10.6%), 1.12 h-1 (10.7%), 140 L (7.7%) and 14.7 L/h (6.97%), respectively. No link was seen with high blood sugar, blood sugar levels, diabetes diagnosis, age, sex, weight, body mass index, or certain DNA sequences. This model measuring drug activity accurately estimated GBP concentrations in those with neuropathic pain, using kidney drug filtration rate for total drug clearance. The distribution and removal processes of GBP were not affected by high blood sugar or diabetes."
45,31237193,"Chronic wounds unresponsive to existing treatments constitute a serious disease burden. Factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic ulcers include oxidative stress, comorbid microbial infections, and the type of immune system response. Preclinically, and in a case study, a formulation containing a Ceratothoa oestroides olive oil extract promoted wound healing. Patients with chronic venous and pressure ulcers, clinically assessed as being unresponsive to healing agents, were treated for 3 months with an ointment containing the C oestroides extract combined with antibiotic and/or antiseptic agents chosen according to the type of bacterial infection. Treatment evaluation was performed using the Bates-Jensen criteria with +WoundDesk and MOWA cell phone applications. After 3 months of treatment, C oestroides resulted in an average decrease of 36% in the Bates-Jensen score of ulcers (P < .000), with the decrease being significant from the first month (P < .007). The combined use of topically applied antibiotics and antiseptics efficiently controlled microbial ulcer infection and facilitated wound healing. In relation to other factors such as initial wound size, chronicity appeared to be an important prognostic factor regarding the extent of wound healing. Future clinical investigations assessing the wound healing efficacy of the C oestroides olive oil extract are warranted.","Long-lasting wounds that do not respond to available treatments have serious impacts. Things that determine how bedsores progress include low antioxidant levels, other infections caused by microbes (microorganisms), and the type of immune system response. Before symptoms, and in a detailed study, a mixture containing a Ceratothoa oestroides (fish parasite) olive oil extract increased wound healing. Patients with long-lasting leg ulcers (sores) due to blood flow problems and bedsores, determined by doctors as not responding to healing treatments, were treated for 3 months with an ointment with C oestroides extract combined with antibiotics (kill bacteria) and/or antiseptics (slow bacteria growth) based on type of bacterial infection. We evaluated treatment using a common tool used to track wound healing with two cell phone apps. After 3 months of treatment, C oestroides caused an average score decrease of 36% on a common tool used to track wound healing. Applying both antibiotics and antiseptics controlled ulcer infection by microorganisms and helped wound healing. Compared to things like initial wound size, how long lasting the wound was seemed to be an important factor in predicting how much the wound healed. Future studies looking at how well C oestroides olive oil extract works to heal wounds are needed.",
47,34233724,"Background: Severe hypercalcemia is rare in newborns; even though often asymptomatic, it may have important sequelae. Hypophosphatemia can occur in infants experiencing intrauterine malnutrition, sepsis and early high-energy parenteral nutrition (PN) and can cause severe hypercalcemia through an unknown mechanism. Monitoring and supplementation of phosphate (PO4) and calcium (Ca) in the first week of life in preterm infants are still debated. Case presentation: We report on a female baby born at 29 weeks' gestation with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) experiencing sustained severe hypercalcemia (up to 24 mg/dl corrected Ca) due to hypophosphatemia while on phosphorus-free PN. Hypercalcemia did not improve after hyperhydration and furosemide but responded to infusion of PO4. Eventually, the infant experienced symptomatic hypocalcaemia (ionized Ca 3.4 mg/dl), likely exacerbated by contemporary infusion of albumin. Subsequently, a normalization of both parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was observed. Conclusions: Although severe hypercalcemia is extremely rare in neonates, clinicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of this life-threatening condition in infants with or at risk to develop hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemic hypercalcemia can only be managed with infusion of PO4, with strict monitoring of Ca and PO4 concentrations.","Severe hypercalcemia, or too high calcium blood levels, is rare in newborns. Even though hypercalcemia often shows no symptoms, it may have important effects on overall health. Hypophosphatemia is when the body has low levels of phosphorous. Hypophosphatemia can occur in infants experiencing malnutrition while in the womb, blood infection, and early high-energy parenteral nutrition (PN). PN is when a mother is given nutrients through IV. Hypophosphatemia can cause severe hypercalcemia through an unknown mechanism. It is debated if phosphate (PO4) and calcium (Ca) should be given in the first week of life in preterm infants. This study reports on a female baby born at 29 weeks' gestation (time in womb). The infant had intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and long-term severe hypercalcemia due to hypophosphatemia while on phosphorus-free PN. IUGR is when a baby does not grow to normal weight during pregnancy. Hypercalcemia did not improve after excess water intake but responded to infusion of PO4. Eventually, the infant experienced symptoms of hypocalcemia. This was likely worsened by infusion of albumin, a blood protein. Following this, parathyroid hormone (PTH), which controls calcium and phosphorus in the blood, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which removes phosphate groups, returned to normal levels. Severe hypercalcemia is extremely rare in newborns. However, doctors should be aware of the possible occurrence of this life-threatening condition in infants with or at risk to develop hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemic hypercalcemia can only be managed with infusion of PO4, with strict monitoring of Ca and PO4 concentrations.",

34,26391748,"A panel of internists and nephrologists developed this practical approach for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative to guide assessment and care of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by primary care clinicians. Chronic kidney disease is defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min/1.73m  and/or markers of kidney damage for at least 3 months. In clinical practice the most common tests for CKD include GFR estimated from the serum creatinine concentration (eGFR) and albuminuria from the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Assessment of eGFR and albuminuria should be performed for persons with diabetes and/or hypertension but is not recommended for the general population. Management of CKD includes reducing the patient's risk of CKD progression and risk of associated complications, such as acute kidney injury and cardiovascular disease, anemia, and metabolic acidosis, as well as mineral and bone disorder. Prevention of CKD progression requires blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for patients with albuminuria and hypertension, hemoglobin A1c ≤7% for patients with diabetes, and correction of CKD-associated metabolic acidosis. To reduce patient safety hazards from medications, the level of eGFR should be considered when prescribing, and nephrotoxins should be avoided, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The main reasons to refer to nephrology specialists are eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), severe albuminuria, and acute kidney injury. The ultimate goal of CKD management is to prevent disease progression, minimize complications, and promote quality of life.","A group of internal medicine and kidney doctors developed a practical approach to guide the assessment (diagnosis) and care of chronic kidney disease by primary care doctors. Chronic kidney disease is defined by using a glomerular filtration rate, a blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working, and/or other measurements or conditions that are a sign of kidney damage for at least 3 months. The most common tests for chronic kidney disease include the glomerular filtration rate that is estimated from the amount of creatinine (a waste product from the normal wear and tear on muscles) in the blood and too much albumin (a blood protein) in the urine which is called albuminuria. These tests for creatinine levels and albumin proteins should be done for people with diabetes and/or high blood pressure but are not recommended for the general population. Managing chronic kidney disease includes reducing the patient's risk of the disease getting worse and risk of related complications, such as acute or immediate kidney injury or heart disease. To prevent chronic kidney disease from worsening, managing blood pressure, using medications to treat high albumin levels and high blood pressure, measuring hemoglobin levels (red blood cells) for patients with diabetes, and correcting when there is too much acid in the body's fluids is needed. To reduce the negative effect of medications on patients, the level of creatinine should be noted when prescribing drugs, and nephrotoxins which can damage the kidneys should be avoided. The main reasons to send a patient to a kidney specialist are based on creatinine levels, severe albuminuria (too much protein in urine), and acute kidney injury (a sudden episode of kidney failure). The main goal of managing chronic kidney disease is to prevent the disease from getting worse, to minimize complications, and to promote quality of life.","A group of specialists created this practical approach for Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative to guide analysis and care of long-lasting or chronic kidney disease (CKD) by primary care workers.

Repurposing of existing drugs is a good strategy to discover new candidate drugs. In this text, perphenazine (PPZ), approved for psychosis therapy, was identified as a potential agent for the treatment of both progesterone sensitive and resistant endometrial cancer for the first time. Specifically, perphenazine exhibited good cell proliferation inhibition in Ishikawa (ISK) and KLE cell lines according to the CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay. It also reduced the cell migration of ISK and KLE cell lines in the light of the transwell migration assay. Annexin-V/PI double staining assay suggested that perphenazine could effectively induce ISK and KLE cell apoptosis. Moreover, results of western blot assay indicated perphenazine obviously inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt.

41,17965720,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an important cause of end-stage renal disease, for which there is no proven therapy. Mutations in PKD1 (the gene encoding polycystin-1) are the principal cause of this disease. The disease begins in utero and is slowly progressive, but it is not known whether cystogenesis is an ongoing process during adult life. We now show that inactivation of Pkd1 in mice before postnatal day 13 results in severely cystic kidneys within 3 weeks, whereas inactivation at day 14 and later results in cysts only after 5 months. We found that cellular proliferation was not appreciably higher in cystic specimens than in age-matched controls, but the abrupt change in response to Pkd1 inactivation corresponded to a previously unrecognized brake point during renal growth and significant changes in gene expression. These findings suggest that the effects of Pkd1 inactivation are defined by a developmental switch that signals the end of the terminal renal maturation process. Our studies show that Pkd1 regulates tubular morphology in both developing and adult kidney, but the pathologic consequences of inactivation are defined by the organ's developmental status. These results have important implications for clinical understanding of the disease and therapeutic approaches.","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an inherited disease that causes many cysts (growths) usually in the kidneys, and is an important cause of end-stage kidney disease, for which there is no proven therapy. Changes in the PKD1 gene (which creates an active kidney protein) are the main causes of this disease. The disease begins before birth and develops slowly, but it is not known whether the development and growth of cysts is an ongoing process during adult life. When the Pkd1 gene is not active in mice within 13 days after birth, this results in many cysts in the kidneys within 3 weeks. However, inactivation (turning off) of Pkd1 at day 14 or later results in cysts only after 5 months. Researchers find that cell growth and development is not higher in samples of cysts than in comparison groups. However, the sudden change of Pkd1 becoming inactive matched a stopping point of kidney growth that is not previously recognized and matched significant changes in how the gene functions. These findings suggest that the effects of inactivating the Pkd1 gene are like a switch that signals the end of the end-stage kidney process. These studies show that Pkd1 regulates changes in both developing kidneys and in adult kidneys, but the process of inactivation are defined by the stage of the organ's development.

19,32721557,"Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease, has been linked to increased central and peripheral inflammation. Although the response of the immune system to dopaminergic treatment remains to be fully understood, dopaminergic agonists are known to exhibit immunoregulatory properties which may, at least in part, explain their therapeutic effect in PD. This highlights the need of analyzing immune parameters in longitudinal studies on PD patients receiving specific therapeutic regimes. In this work, PD patients were included in a two-year prospective study comparing the effect of levodopa alone and a levodopa/pramipexole combo therapy on several regulatory and pro-inflammatory immune cell populations. We demonstrated that PD patients show decreased circulating levels of several important regulatory subpopulations, as determined by flow cytometry. Notably, when administered alone, levodopa decreased the levels of functional Bregs and SLAMF1+ tolerogenic DCs and increased the levels of total and HLA-DR+ classical monocytes, while the pramipexole/levodopa combo may promote Treg- and tolerogenic DC-mediated regulatory responses. These results suggest that a regime based on levodopa alone may promote a pro-inflammatory-type response in PD patients, but when combined with pramipexole, it promotes a clinically beneficial regulatory-type environment.","Parkinson's disease (PD) (a brain-related disease affecting movement) is the second most frequent brain-related disease and is linked to increased full-body inflammation. While the immune-related effects of dopamine, a chemical messenger, remain unknown, dopamine imitators treat Parkinson's disease partly via immune-related effects. This therapeutic effect supports analysis of immune scores of patients with Parkinson's disease receiving certain treatments. In this work, patients with Parkinson's were in a two-year study comparing how levodopa (a Parkinson's medication) alone and a levodopa/pramipexole (dopamine imitator) combo affects immune cell subtypes. Patients with Parkinson's have reduced blood levels of important regulatory cell subtypes. Levodopa alone may promote a pro-inflammatory response in patients with Parkinson's, but with pramipexole, it promotes a helpful immune environment.","Parkinson's disease, the second most frequent brain disorder that impacts movement and coordination, is linked to increased central (brain and spinal cord) and peripheral (nerves) inflammation (the body's natural reaction against injury and infection). Although the response of the immune system to dopamine drugs is not fully understood, dopaminergic agonists (a medication that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body to relieve symptoms related to low levels of dopamine) are known to show immune system-regulating characteristics which may, at least in part, explain their effect in Parkinson's disease. There is a need to analyze immune characteristics in long-term studies on Parkinson's disease patients who are receiving specific drugs. In this study, patients with Parkinson's disease are included in a two-year prospective study (a study that takes a set number of subjects and follows them over a long period). This study compares the effect of levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine) alone and a combination of levodopa and pramipexole (dopamine-promoting) drugs on several regulating and pro-inflammatory (capable of causing inflammation) immune cells in the body. Researchers demonstrate that patients with Parkinson's disease show decreased levels of important cells that regulate the immune system. In particular, when given alone, levodopa decreases the levels of functional Bregs (a type of regulating immune cell) and SLAMF1+ tolerogenic DCs (immune receptors and cells that direct and regulate the immune response) and increases the levels of total and HLA DR+classical monocytes (molecules that produce antigens and fight inflammation). The combination of levodopa and pramipexole drugs may promote Treg- and tolerogenic DC responses (cells that regulate responses and may suppress immune response). These results suggest that treatment plans based on levodopa alone may promote a pro-inflammatory type of response in patients with Parkinson's disease, but when combined with pramipexole, it promotes a clinically helpful regulatory-type environment."
9,33448766,"Dysphagia is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, rather than their perceived location, should guide the initial evaluation and imaging. Obstructive symptoms that seem to originate in the throat or neck may actually be caused by distal esophageal lesions. Oropharyngeal dysphagia manifests as difficulty initiating swallowing, coughing, choking, or aspiration, and it is most commonly caused by chronic neurologic conditions such as stroke, Parkinson disease, or dementia. Symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated because of the risk of aspiration. Patients with esophageal dysphagia may report a sensation of food getting stuck after swallowing. This condition is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional esophageal disorders. Eosinophilic esophagitis is triggered by food allergens and is increasingly prevalent; esophageal biopsies should be performed to make the diagnosis. Esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia are relatively rare and may be overdiagnosed. Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction is becoming more common. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for the initial evaluation of esophageal dysphagia, with barium esophagography as an adjunct. Esophageal cancer and other serious conditions have a low prevalence, and testing in low-risk patients may be deferred while a four-week trial of acid-suppressing therapy is undertaken. Many frail older adults with progressive neurologic disease have significant but unrecognized dysphagia, which significantly increases their risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment. In these patients, the diagnosis of dysphagia should prompt a discussion about goals of care before potentially harmful interventions are considered. Speech-language pathologists and other specialists, in collaboration with family physicians, can provide structured assessments and make appropriate recommendations for safe swallowing, palliative care, or rehabilitation.","Trouble swallowing is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, not the area where they are thought to come from, should guide the first exam and visual tests. Symptoms of difficulty breathing that seem to come from the throat or neck may actually be caused by damage in the lower esophagus. Difficulty swallowing that happens in the mouth or the throat shows up as difficulty starting swallowing, coughing, choking, or something entering the airway or lungs by accident. It is most often caused by long-term brain conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's, or memory, language, and thinking loss. Symptoms should be looked at closely due to the risk of something entering the airway or lungs by accident. People with problems that happen during swallowing may describe a feeling of food getting stuck after swallowing. Problems that happen during swallowing is most often caused by stomach-related reflux diseases and disorders of the esophagus with symptoms like heartburn and chest pain. A long-term allergic condition of the esophagus is set off by food allergens and is more and more common. To diagnose this condition, a small part of the esophagus should be removed for examination. Dysfunction of the esophagus that causes difficulty swallowing such as a disorder in which your esophagus is unable to move food and liquids down into your stomach are pretty rare and may be overdiagnosed. Dysfunction of the esophagus caused by opioids is becoming more common. Using a flexible tube with a camera to look at the esophagus, stomach and part of the small intestine is used to look at difficulty swallowing that happens in the mouth and throat, together with barium and X-rays. Cancer of the esophagus and other serious conditions are not common, and low-risk people may take acid reducers for 4 weeks before undergoing testing. Many weak older adults with progressive deterioration in functioning have serious but unseen difficulty swallowing, which really increases their risk of pneumonia (lung infection) caused by something entering the airway or lungs by accident and risk of lacking nutrients in the body. In these people, the diagnosis of difficulty breathing should lead to a conversation about what is important to the person before suggesting possibly harmful treatments. People who treat communication and swallowing disorders and other specialists, working with family doctors, can evaluate and make suggestions for safe swallowing, care for people living with a serious illness, or rehab.",
17,1536482,"Study objectives: Many factors influence the rate of gastric emptying and therefore the rate of drug absorption in the orally poisoned patient. Limited studies have evaluated the effect of body position on the rate of gastric emptying of radiographically marked foods and contrast media, but effects on drug absorption have not been studied previously. Our hypothesis was that body position would have an effect on the rate of drug absorption in an oral overdose model. Design: A blinded, within-subjects (crossover) design. Participants: Six male and six female healthy, adult volunteer subjects with no concurrent drug use or medications affecting gastrointestinal function. Interventions: Five body positions commonly used in prehospital and emergency department settings were examined: left lateral decubitus, right lateral decubitus, supine, prone, and sitting. All were performed by all subjects in random order with a three-day washout phase between trials. To simulate an acute overdose, fasted subjects ingested 80 mg/kg acetaminophen in the form of 160-mg pediatric tablets. Each subject then remained in the body position for that trial for two hours. Acetaminophen levels were obtained at 15-minute intervals, and a two-hour area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each subject trial to represent total drug absorption during each study period. Investigators were blinded to all results until all trials were completed. Measurements and main results: All subjects completed the study. Group mean drug absorption as represented by two-hour AUC (mg.L.min) was calculated for each body position. AUC for left lateral decubitus (6,006 +/- 2,614) was lowest but did not significantly differ from that for supine (6,649 +/- 2,761). Both were significantly less than those for prone (7,432 +/- 1,809), right lateral decubitus (8,950 +/- 1,405), and sitting (8,608 +/- 1,725) positions (P less than .05 by one-way analysis of variance and follow-up paired t tests). Conclusion: Initial drug absorption as determined by two-hour AUC was lowest in the left lateral decubitus position. Although the difference between the left lateral decubitus and supine positions did not reach statistical significance, both left lateral decubitus and supine were significantly lower than three other common patient body positions tested. Because the left lateral decubitus position has other advantages (eg, prevention of aspiration) in addition to minimizing drug absorption, we recommend that orally poisoned patients be placed in the left lateral decubitus position for prehospital and initial ED management.","Many things determine how fast the stomach empties and therefore how fast a drug is taken in by the body in a person who swallows a toxic substance. Few studies have rated the effect of body position on how fast the stomach empties via a technique to more easily see stomach contents with x-rays. However, effects on how fast a drug is absorbed have not been studied before. We thought that body position would have an effect on how fast a drug is absorbed in a person who swallows a toxic substance. Participants were six male and six female healthy, adult volunteers not taking any drugs or medicine affecting stomach function. We looked at five body positions often used before hospital and emergency room treatment: left side, right side, back, stomach, and sitting. Participants did every position in random order with a 3-day break between trials. To pretend that participants swallowed a toxic substance, participants did not eat prior to taking 80 mg of Tylenol/kg of body weight in the form of 160-mg children's tablets. Each participant then stayed in the body position for that trial for two hours. We measured Tylenol levels every 15 minutes. We calculated how much Tylenol participants absorbed over 2 hours for each trial. Investigators did not know the results until after the trials were done. All participants finished the study. We calculated average amount of drug absorbed for each body position. The average amount of drug absorbed was lowest for the left side, which was similar to the back position. Absorption for the left side and back were less than for stomach, right side, and sitting positions. We concluded that drug absorption was lowest for the left side position. Although the difference between the left side and back positions did not differ significantly, both the left side and back positions were significantly lower than the three other positions tested. Because the left side position is better for other reasons (e.g., material entering the airway or lungs by accident) than decreasing how much drug is absorbed, we suggest that people who swallow a toxic substance be put in the left side position before going to the hospital and emergency room.",
46,32637102,"Cystic fibrosis patients display multi-organ system dysfunction (e.g. pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and lung) with pathogenesis linked to a failure of Cl- secretion from the epithelial surfaces of these organs. If unmanaged, organ dysfunction starts early and patients experience chronic respiratory infection with reduced lung function and a failure to thrive due to gastrointestinal malabsorption. Early mortality is typically caused by respiratory failure. In the past 40 years of newborn screening and improved disease management have driven the median survival up from the mid-teens to 43-53, with most of that improvement coming from earlier and more aggressive management of the symptoms. In the last decade, promising pharmacotherapies have been developed for the correction of the underlying epithelial dysfunction, namely, Cl- secretion. A new generation of systemic drugs target the mutated Cl- channels in cystic fibrosis patients and allow trafficking of the immature mutated protein to the cell membrane (correctors), restore function to the channel once in situ (potentiators), or increase protein levels in the cells (amplifiers). Restoration of channel function prior to symptom development has the potential to significantly change the trajectory of disease progression and their evidence suggests that a modest restoration of Cl- secretion may delay disease progression by decades. In this article, we review epithelial vectorial ion and fluid transport, its quantification and measurement as a marker for cystic fibrosis ion transport dysfunction, and highlight some of the recent therapies targeted at the dysfunctional ion transport of cystic fibrosis.","People with cystic fibrosis have organs that do not function correctly (e.g., pancreas, digestive system, and lung) linked to not enough CI- (chloride) production and release from epithelial cells (cells that cover outer surface of the internal organs). If not treated, organs quickly stop working and patients have long-term respiratory infection with decreased lung function and a decline in health from poor absorption of food. Early death usually happens when lungs can't get enough oxygen into the blood. The past 40 years of newborn checks and better ways to treat disease have increased the age that half of patients are still alive from the mid-teens to 43-53, with most of the increase due to earlier and more aggressive management of the symptoms. In the last 10 years, drugs have been made to correct underlying problems in epithelial cells, mainly, CI- production and release. New drugs for cystic fibrosis patients that work throughout the body target the changed atom (Cl-; chloride) channels and help the changed protein to move to the cell surface (correctors), hold the gate to the channel open so chloride can flow through the cell membrane (potentiators), or increase protein levels in the cells (amplifiers). Restoring channel function before symptoms develop could change the course of the disease and a small repair of Cl- production and release may delay disease worsening by decades. We look at movement of ions (charged atoms) and fluids in epithelial cells, how to count and measure this movement as a sign of cystic fibrosis transport problems, and discuss recent treatments for cystic fibrosis transport problems.",
32,27845713,"Hypertension, a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, is the world's leading cause of preventable, premature death. A common polymorphism (677C→T) in the gene encoding the folate metabolizing enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is associated with increased blood pressure, and there is accumulating evidence demonstrating that this phenotype can be modulated, specifically in individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype, by the B-vitamin riboflavin, an essential co-factor for MTHFR. The underlying mechanism that links this polymorphism, and the related gene-nutrient interaction, with hypertension is currently unknown. Previous research has shown that 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the product of the reaction catalysed by MTHFR, appears to be a positive allosteric modulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and may thus increase the production of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator. Blood pressure follows a circadian pattern, peaking shortly after wakening and falling during the night, a phenomenon known as 'dipping'. Any deviation from this pattern, which can only be identified using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), has been associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. This review will consider the evidence linking this polymorphism and novel gene-nutrient interaction with hypertension and the potential mechanisms that might be involved. The role of ABPM in B-vitamin research and in nutrition research generally will also be reviewed.","Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke.

32,33172445,"Background: Genome-wide and clinical studies have linked the 677C→T polymorphism in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with hypertension, whilst limited evidence shows that intervention with riboflavin (i.e. the MTHFR co-factor) can lower blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype. We investigated the impact of this common polymorphism on BP throughout adulthood and hypothesised that riboflavin status would modulate the genetic risk of hypertension. Methods: Observational data on 6076 adults of 18-102 years were drawn from the Joint Irish Nutrigenomics Organisation project, comprising the Trinity-Ulster Department of Agriculture (TUDA; volunteer sample) and the National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS; population-based sample) cohorts. Participants were recruited from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (UK) in 2008-2012 using standardised methods. Results: The variant MTHFR 677TT genotype was identified in 12% of adults. From 18 to 70 years, this genotype was associated with an increased risk of hypertension (i.e. systolic BP ≥ 140 and/or a diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg): odds ratio (OR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.90; P = 0.016, after adjustment for antihypertensive drug use and other significant factors, namely, age, male sex, BMI, alcohol and total cholesterol. Low or deficient biomarker status of riboflavin (observed in 30.2% and 30.0% of participants, respectively) exacerbated the genetic risk of hypertension, with a 3-fold increased risk for the TT genotype in combination with deficient riboflavin status (OR 3.00, 95% CI, 1.34-6.68; P = 0.007) relative to the CC genotype combined with normal riboflavin status. Up to 65 years, we observed poorer BP control rates on antihypertensive treatment in participants with the TT genotype (30%) compared to those without this variant, CT (37%) and CC (45%) genotypes (P < 0.027). Conclusions: The MTHFR 677TT genotype is associated with higher BP independently of homocysteine and predisposes adults to an increased risk of hypertension and poorer BP control with antihypertensive treatment, whilst better riboflavin status is associated with a reduced genetic risk. Riboflavin intervention may thus offer a personalised approach to prevent the onset of hypertension in adults with the TT genotype; however, this requires confirmation in a randomised trial in non-hypertensive adults.","Genetic and clinical studies have linked variation in a specific DNA sequence for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a certain protein, with high blood pressure. Some evidence shows that treatment with riboflavin (a molecule that attaches to MTHFR) can lower blood pressure (BP) in patients with high blood pressure and an altered DNA sequence for MTHFR called 677TT. We tested the impact of this altered DNA sequence on BP through adulthood. We believed that riboflavin would affect the genetic risk of high blood pressure. Patients were recruited from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in 2008-2012. The altered DNA sequence of MTHFR 677TT was found in 12% of adults. From 18 to 70 years, this altered DNA sequence, or genotype, was linked with increased risk of high blood pressure after adjusting for blood pressure medication use, age, sex, body mass, alcohol, total cholesterol, and other factors. Low or no riboflavin (seen in 30.2% and 30.0% of participants, respectively) worsened the genetic risk of high blood pressure. Patients with a certain genotype along with no riboflavin had a 3-fold increased risk compared to patients with the standard genotype along with normal riboflavin. Up to 65 years, we saw poorer BP control rates on anti-high-BP treatment in participants with a certain DNA sequence for MTHFR compared to those without this altered DNA sequence. A specific gentoype for MTHFR is linked with higher BP regardless of homocysteine, a molecule that MTHFR acts on, and biases adults to increased risk of high BP and poorer BP control with anti-high-BP treatment. Better riboflavin amount is linked with reduced genetic risk. Riboflavin treatment may thus give an individualized approach to prevent high BP in adults with a certain genotype for MTHFR. Still, this needs confirmation in a trial in adults without high BP.","Research has linked a specific a genetic variation or gene change, known as 677C→T, within the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR - a blood-pressure-related protein) with hypertension (high blood pressure). Limited evidence has shown that taking riboflavin, which is a co-factor or helper of MTHFR, can lower blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype. This study investigated the impact of the common genetic variation on BP throughout adulthood. They hypothesized that riboflavin status would alter the genetic risk of hypertension. Observational data on 6076 adults of 18-102 years were drawn from the Joint Irish Nutrigenomics Organization project, comprising the Trinity-Ulster Department of Agriculture (TUDA; volunteer sample) and the National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS; population-based sample) cohorts or groups. Participants were recruited from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (UK) in 2008-2012 using standard methods. The genetic variant MTHFR 677TT genotype was identified in 12% of recruited adults. In patients 18 to 70 years old, this genotype was associated with an increased risk of hypertension. Low or deficient levels of riboflavin increased the genetic risk of hypertension. Participants with 677TT genotype and a riboflavin deficiency have a 3-fold higher risk of developing hypertension. In participants up to 65 years, the authors observed poorer BP control rates on antihypertensive treatment in participants with the TT genotype compared to participants with other genotypes (CC or CT). The study concluded the MTHFR 677TT genotype is associated with higher BP independently of homocysteine levels. Homocysteine is a chemical your body produces to help make proteins. Additionally, the MTHFR 677TT genotype makes people more likely to have an increased risk of hypertension and poorer BP control with antihypertensive treatment. Better riboflavin status was associated with a reduced genetic risk for hypertension. Riboflavin administration or use may offer a personalized or unique approach to prevent the onset or start of hypertension in adults with the TT genotype. However, this requires more researched in non-hypertensive adults."
28,34578462,"Evidence is emerging that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect various organs of the body, including cardiomyocytes and cardiac endothelial cells in the heart. This review focuses on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the heart after direct infection that can lead to myocarditis and an outline of potential treatment options. The main points are: (1) Viral entry: SARS-CoV-2 uses specific receptors and proteases for docking and priming in cardiac cells. Thus, different receptors or protease inhibitors might be effective in SARS-CoV-2-infected cardiac cells. (2) Viral replication: SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for replication. Drugs acting against ssRNA(+) viral replication for cardiac cells can be effective. (3) Autophagy and double-membrane vesicles: SARS-CoV-2 manipulates autophagy to inhibit viral clearance and promote SARS-CoV-2 replication by creating double-membrane vesicles as replication sites. (4) Immune response: Host immune response is manipulated to evade host cell attacks against SARS-CoV-2 and increased inflammation by dysregulating immune cells. Efficiency of immunosuppressive therapy must be elucidated. (5) Programmed cell death: SARS-CoV-2 inhibits programmed cell death in early stages and induces apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in later stages. (6) Energy metabolism: SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to disturbed energy metabolism that in turn leads to a decrease in ATP production and ROS production. (7) Viroporins: SARS-CoV-2 creates viroporins that lead to an imbalance of ion homeostasis. This causes apoptosis, altered action potential, and arrhythmia.","There is evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a severe breathing-related virus, can infect various body organs, like heart cells. This review focuses on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the heart after direct infection that can cause myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) and possible treatments. The main points are: (1) Viral entry: SARS-CoV-2 uses specific cell parts to attach to heart cells. Thus, different blockers of specific cell parts may help with SARS-CoV-2-infected heart cells. (2) Viral replication: SARS-CoV-2 uses a specific molecule for replication. Drugs acting against a specific form of viral replication for heart cells can be effective. (3) Cell degradation and transport molecules: SARS-COV-2 alters cell degradation to block virus removal and promote virus replication by making transport molecules as replication sites. (4) Immune response: Patient immune response is altered to evade paitent cell attacks against SARS-CoV-2 and increased inflammation by impairing immune cells. Efficiency of immune-system-suppressing therapy must be explained. (5) Intentional cell death: SARS-CoV-2 blocks intentional cell death in early stages and causes cell death in later stages. (6) Energy metabolism: SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to damaged energy metabolism that leads to a decrease in energy and reactive chemical production. (7) Virus channels: SARS-CoV-2 pokes openings in the cell that leads to leaking of important cell molecules. This leaking causes cell death, altered cell signals, and an irregular heart beat.","New scientific research has shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease), can infect various parts of the body, including cells within the heart. This paper reviews the effects COVID-19 has on the heart after direct infection, which can lead to myocarditis. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle. This paper will also outline potential treatment options for this illness. The authors proposed seven potential treatment options to help reduce heart injury in COVID-19 patients. First, the virus uses specific entry points to infect heart cells so that it can replicate and grow stronger. Therefore, specific drugs that target these entry points might be helpful. Second, COVID-19 uses a specific pathway to replicate itself. This pathway uses RNA, a chain of genetic material that helps form proteins. Drugs that prevent the creation of RNA for viral replication could be helpful. Third, COVID-19 decreases the body's ability to degrade infected cells. This prevents the body from decreasing the amount of virus within it. COVID-19 is able to replicate as it creates double-membrane vesicles, extra-strong chambers, as spaces safe from the body's natural defense system. Fourth, COVID-19 can cause the host immune response to be changed so that the virus is not targeted for removal. It can also increase inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) which alters the function of immune cells. Better understanding of drugs that suppress the immune system is needed. Fifth, COVID-19 prevents cells from dying in the early stages of infection but induces cell death later, once it has replicated and moved to other cells. Sixth, COVID-19 infection can disturb energy metabolism (the process in getting energy from food). This can reduce energy production and affect cell function and viability. Seventh, COVID-19 creates virus proteins to lead to an imbalance within the host body. This can cause cell death, abnormal heart function, and an abnormal heartbeat."

Coins were the most common foreign objects (60%), followed by meat-related substances (22.5%) and dentures (5%). Issues occured in 18% of patients and were more common in adults (37.1%) compared to children (8.8%). The most serious issue was air trapped in the area between the lungs. Serious issues occured with dentures (80%) and bone chips (42%). Foreign objects in the esophagus is serious and early removal with esophagus checks, which are safe and effective, is recommended.","Our objective is to rate treatment of objects that shouldn't be eaten found in the mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, and upper part of the small intestine. We included 103 patients who ate objects that shouldn't be eaten. Neck x-rays and a procedure that uses a stiff, inflexible tube with a camera were done to diagnose and remove the objects that shouldn't be eaten. We recorded all information using a questionnaire. Trouble swallowing (92%) and soreness in neck (60%) were the most common symptoms. Most of the patients (89%) had come to the hospital within 24 hours. X-rays of the side of the neck helped the most with air in the esophagus being an important finding. The part of the throat that allows food to pass into the esophagus was where objects that shouldn't be eaten got stuck in 84% of people. Using a flexible tube with a camera worked in 90 patients (97%) and didn't work in 3 patients (3%). Coins were swallowed most often (60%), followed by meat (22.5%) and dentures (5%). Complications happened in 18% of patients and were more common in adults (37.1%) compared to children (8.8%). The most serious complication was air in the center of the chest. People who swallowed dentures (80%) and bone chips (42%) had the most complications. We concluded that objects in the esophagus that shouldn't be eaten are a serious condition and early removal by inserting a flexible tube with a camera is safe and works."
35,29946735,"Importance: By 2020, approximately 12.3 million individuals in the United States older than 50 years are expected to have osteoporosis. Osteoporotic fractures, particularly hip fractures, are associated with limitations in ambulation, chronic pain and disability, loss of independence, and decreased quality of life, and 21% to 30% of patients who experience a hip fracture die within 1 year. The prevalence of primary osteoporosis (ie, osteoporosis without underlying disease) increases with age and differs by race/ethnicity. With the aging of the US population, the potential preventable burden is likely to increase in future years. Objective: To update the 2011 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for osteoporosis. Evidence review: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for and treatment of osteoporotic fractures in men and women, as well as risk assessment tools, screening intervals, and efficacy of screening and treatment in subgroups. The screening population was postmenopausal women and older men with no known previous osteoporotic fractures and no known comorbid conditions or medication use associated with secondary osteoporosis. Findings: The USPSTF found convincing evidence that bone measurement tests are accurate for detecting osteoporosis and predicting osteoporotic fractures in women and men. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that clinical risk assessment tools are moderately accurate in identifying risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that drug therapies reduce subsequent fracture rates in postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found that the evidence is inadequate to assess the effectiveness of drug therapies in reducing subsequent fracture rates in men without previous fractures. Conclusions and recommendation: The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years and older. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years at increased risk of osteoporosis, as determined by a formal clinical risk assessment tool. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men. (I statement).","By 2020, about 12.3 million people in the United States older than 50 years are expected to have osteoporosis, a condition in which bones become weak and brittle. Broken bones from osteoporosis, especially hip breaks, are related to a limited ability to walk, long-term pain and disability, loss of independence, and reduced quality of life. 21% to 30% of people who break a hip die within 1 year. The number of people during a specific period with primary osteoporosis (i.e., osteoporosis not resulting from other disease), goes up with age and changes depending on race/ethnicity. With the U.S. population getting older, the possible cost of preventable disease is expected to go up in the future. We aim to update a 2011 expert panel suggestion on checking for osteoporosis. The expert panel looked at scientific studies on checking for and treatment of bone breaks due to osteoporosis in men and women, and tools to measure risk, periods between checks, and how well checks and treatment work in smaller groups. The group that was checked for osteoporosis was women who had gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) and older men who had never had a known bone break due to osteoporosis and no known conditions or drug use known to cause osteoporosis. The expert panel found strong proof that bone measurement tests are correct for finding osteoporosis and predicting bone breaks due to osteoporosis in women and men. The expert panel found some proof that tools to measure risk are somewhat correct in finding risk of osteoporosis and bone breaks due to osteoporosis. The expert panel found strong proof that drugs decrease later bone break rates in women who have gone through menopause. The expert panel found there is not enough proof to measure how well drugs work to decrease later bone break rates in men without previous bone breaks. The expert panel suggests checking for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent bone breaks from osteoporosis in women 65 years and older. The expert panel suggests checking for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent bone breaks from osteoporosis in women younger than 65 years who have gone through menopause who have a greater risk of osteoporosis, as decided by a tool used by doctors to measure risk. The expert panel concludes there is not enough data to measure the pros versus cons of checking for osteoporosis to prevent bone breaks from osteoporosis in men. ",
41,33549515,"DNA damage and alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) signaling could be one of the molecular mechanisms mediating focal kidney cyst formation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that markers of DNA damage and DDR signaling are increased in human and experimental ADPKD. In the human ADPKD transcriptome, the number of up-regulated DDR-related genes was increased by 16.6-fold compared with that in normal kidney, and by 2.5-fold in cystic compared with that in minimally cystic tissue (P < 0.0001). In end-stage human ADPKD tissue, γ-H2A histone family member X (H2AX), phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia and radiation-sensitive mutant 3 (Rad3)-related (pATR), and phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM) localized to cystic kidney epithelial cells. In vitro, pATR and pATM were also constitutively increased in human ADPKD tubular cells (WT 9-7 and 9-12) compared with control (HK-2). In addition, extrinsic oxidative DNA damage by hydrogen peroxide augmented γ-H2AX and cell survival in human ADPKD cells, and exacerbated cyst growth in the three-dimensional Madin-Darby canine kidney cyst model. In contrast, DDR-related gene expression was only transiently increased on postnatal day 0 in Pkd1RC/RC mice, and not altered at later time points up to 12 months of age. In conclusion, DDR signaling is dysregulated in human ADPKD and during the early phases of murine ADPKD. The constitutive expression of the DDR pathway in ADPKD may promote survival of PKD1-mutated cells and contribute to kidney cyst growth.","Damage to DNA and changes to the body's response to DNA damage, called DNA damage response or DDR, could be one of the processes involved in the development of kidney cysts (growths) in the inherited disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This study aims to test the idea that certain types of DNA damage and DDR signaling are increased in ADPKD experiments. In the part of the human ADPKD genes that transfer information to molecules, the DNA damage response (DDR) genes increased 16 times compared with that in a normal kidney. DDR also more than doubled in tissues with cysts compared to DDR in tissues with few cysts. In tissues from end-stage human ADPKD, certain genes and protein enzymes involved in the DDR to detect and repair damaged DNA focus on cystic kidney epithelial cells, which are important cells for kidney function. In lab tests, protein enzymes are also increased in human ADPKD cells located in the tubal duct system of the kidneys when compared with normal tubal cells. Additionally, some DNA damage increases genes and cell survival in human ADPKD cells, and worsens cyst growth in one animal experiment. In contrast, DNA damage response (DDR) gene processing is only temporarily increased on the day of birth in mice, and not altered at later times up to 12 months of age. In conclusion, DDR signals to other cells are not controlled well in human ADPKD and during the early phases of animal ADPKD. The use of the DNA damage response in ADPKD may promote survival of gene cells that have mutated (changed) and contribute to cyst growth in the kidneys.",

49,27586538,"Background: Leg edema is a common adverse effect of dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB) that may need dose reduction or drug withdrawal, adversely affecting the antihypertensive efficacy. Leg edema is reported to occur less often with (S)-amlodipine compared to conventional racemic amlodipine. We aimed to find the incidence of leg edema as a primary outcome and antihypertensive efficacy with (S)-amlodipine compared to conventional amlodipine. Methods: This prospective, double-blind, controlled clinical trial randomized 172 hypertensive patients, not controlled on beta-blockers (BB) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), to either conventional amlodipine (5-10 mg; n = 86) or (S)-amlodipine (2.5-5 mg; n = 86), while continuing their previous anti-hypertensive medications. Sample was sufficient to find a difference in edema between the interventions with 80 % power at 5 % significance level. Intension to treat analysis (ITT) for safety data and per protocol analysis for efficacy data was performed. Fischer's exact test was applied to observe difference between responder rates and proportions of subjects having peripheral edema in the two groups. Pitting edema test scores were compared using Mann-Whitney test. Results: Altogether 146 patients (amlodipine, n = 76 and (S)-amlodipine, n = 70) completed 120 days treatment. Demographic variables and treatment adherence were comparable in the two groups. Incidence of new edema after randomization was 31.40 % in test group and 46.51 % in control group [p = 0.03; absolute risk reduction (ARR) = 15.1 %; Number Needed to Treat (NNT) = 7, ITT analysis]. Pitting edema score and patient rated edema score increased significantly in the control compared to test group (p = 0.038 and 0.036 respectively) after treatment period. Edema scores increased significantly in the control group from baseline (p < 0.0001). Responders in blood pressure were 98.57 % in test and 98.68 % in control group. Most common adverse events (AE) were pitting edema and increased urinary frequency. Incidence of all AEs other than edema was similar in both groups. Two serious AEs occurred unrelated to therapy. Biochemical and ECG parameters in the two groups were comparable. Conclusions: In hypertensive patients not controlled on prior BB and ACEI/ARB therapy, addition of (S)-amlodipine besylate at half the dose of conventional amlodipine provides better tolerability with reduced incidence of peripheral edema, and equal antihypertensive efficacy compared to amlodipine given at usual doses.","Leg edema is a common side effect of dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB), medicines taken to control blood pressure and other conditions. The dose amount of CBB drugs may need to be reduced or stopped, negatively impacting the drugs' use to control blood pressure. Leg edema (fluid swelling) is reported to occur less often with a type of CBB medicine called (S)-amlodipine compared to the regular racemic amlodipine medicine. Researchers aim to find the number of times leg edema appeared and how well blood pressure is lowered with (S)-amlodipine compared to conventional amlodipine. This clinical trial followed 172 patients with high blood pressure, not controlled by using beta-blockers (BB) drugs or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) that keep blood vessels open. These patients are randomly placed in groups to receive either standard amlodipine (86 patients) or (S)-amlodipine (86 patients), while continuing their previous anti-hypertensive medications. The number of patients in this study is sufficient to find a difference in edema between the two groups. Data from both treatment groups are analyzed during the study. Data are analyzed to observe the difference between the two groups on how they responded to the treatment and the number of people who develop peripheral edema (swelling in lower legs and hands). Pitting edema, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation, is measured and scored. Altogether 146 patients completed 120 days treatment: 76 patients in the standard amlodipine group and 70 in the (S)-amlodipine group. Characteristics such as age and sex and how well patients took the medicine as directed are compared between the two groups. New edema is 31.40 % in the (S)-amlodipine group and 46.51 % in the standard group. Pitting edema score and patient rated edema score increase significantly in the amlodipine compared to (S)-amlodipine group after the treatment period. Edema scores increase significantly in the amlodipine group from the start of the study. Responders in blood pressure are 98.57 % in (S)-amlodipine and 98.68 % in amlodipine group. Most common side effects are pitting edema and increase in urinary frequency. Number of all side effects other than edema is similar in both groups. Two serious side effects occur that are unrelated to therapy. Results from other blood and heart tests in the two groups are similar. In patients with high blood pressure not controlled on prior BB and ACEI/ARB therapy, adding (S)-amlodipine besylate at half the dose of standard amlodipine provides few side effects. There is also a reduced number of peripheral edema, and equal ability to lower blood pressure compared to amlodipine given at usual doses.",
15,32673289,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes regulate transcription through epigenetic modification of chromatin structure, but their specific functions in the kidney remain elusive. We discovered that the human kidney expresses class I HDACs. Kidney medulla-specific inhibition of class I HDACs in the rat during high-salt feeding results in hypertension, polyuria, hypokalemia, and nitric oxide deficiency. Three new inducible murine models were used to determine that HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the kidney epithelium are necessary for maintaining epithelial integrity and maintaining fluid-electrolyte balance during increased dietary sodium intake. Moreover, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing determined that epithelial HDAC1 and HDAC2 are necessary for expression of many sodium or water transporters and channels. In performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of serious adverse events associated with clinical HDAC inhibitor use, we found that HDAC inhibitors increased the odds ratio of experiencing fluid-electrolyte disorders, such as hypokalemia. This study provides insight on the mechanisms of potential serious adverse events with HDAC inhibitors, which may be fatal to critically ill patients. In conclusion, kidney tubular HDACs provide a link between the environment, such as consumption of high-salt diets, and regulation of homeostatic mechanisms to remain in fluid-electrolyte balance.","Histone deacetylase (HDAC) are enzymes that control transcription (the process of copying a segment of DNA into messenger RNA, or mRNA, for protein creation), but their specific functions in the kidney are unknown. Researchers discovered that the human kidney uses class I HDACs to activate or build molecules or proteins. The slowing or stopping of class I HDACs from the kidney medulla region in rats during high-salt feedings results in diseases such as hypertension (high blood pressure) and hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood). Three new animal studies are used to determine that HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the kidney epithelium (cells that cover the inner surface of organs) are necessary for maintaining electrolyte (minerals in the body) balance when the body takes in increased sodium. Additionally, epithelial HDAC1 and HDAC2 are necessary for activating many sodium or water transporters and channels across cells. In reviewing all relevant studies of serious side effects connected with clinical HDAC inhibitor use, researchers found that HDAC inhibitors (molecules or enzymes that block actions of an enzyme protein) increased the chance of experiencing fluid-electrolyte disorders (a group of conditions caused by a temporary disturbance in the body's levels of fluids and electrolytes), such as hypokalemia. This study provides a greater understanding of potential serious side effects with HDAC inhibitors, which may be fatal to very ill patients. In conclusion, HDACs from the kidney provide a link between the environment, such as consuming high-salt diets, and regulating processes to stay in fluid-electrolyte balance.",
30,33113040,"Many studies have shown that re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in recovered COVID-19 patients are very common. We aim to conduct this review to summarize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these patients and discuss the potential explanations for recurrences, the contagiousness of re-detectable positive SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the management of COVID-19 patients after discharge from hospital. The proportion of re-positive tests in discharged COVID-19 patients varied from 2.4 to 69.2% and persisted from 1 to 38 days after discharge, depending on population size, age of patients, and type of specimens. Currently, several causes of re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 patients are suggested, including false-negative, false-positive RT-PCR tests; reactivation; and re-infection with SARS-CoV-2, but the mechanism leading to these re-positive cases is still unclear. The prevention of re-positive testing in discharged patients is a fundamental measure to control the spread of the pandemic. In order to reduce the percentage of false-negative tests prior to discharge, we recommend performing more than two tests, according to the standard sampling and microbiological assay protocol. In addition, specimens should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA before discharge. Further studies should be conducted to develop novel assays that target a crucial region of the RNA genome in order to improve its sensitivity and specificity.","Many studies have shown that testing positive again for (or having) coronavirus in recovered Covid-19 patients (patients recovered from the serious viral, lung infection of Covid-19) is very common.

The percentage who re-tested as positive in discharged Covid-19 patients is between 2.4 to 69.2%. Retesting as positive continued from 1 to 38 days after discharge, or release, from the hospital, depending on population size, age, and the type of samples used to test. Currently, several causes of re-positive tests for coronavirus in recovered Covid-19 patients are suggested, including incorrect negative or positive test results; reactivation (when someone appears to have recovered but still has traces of the virus in the body); and being re-infected with coronavirus, but the process leading to these re-positive tests is still unclear. Preventing patients who have recovered and are sent home from testing positive again is an important step to control the spread of the pandemic. To limit the number of false-negatives tests (when a person tests negative but are actually positive for the virus) before being sent home, study researchers suggest doing more than 2 tests. In addition, samples should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify coronavirus DNA before discharge from the hospital.

11,31627352,"Diets low in carbohydrates and proteins and enriched in fat stimulate the hepatic synthesis of ketone bodies (KB). These molecules are used as alternative fuel for energy production in target tissues. The synthesis and utilization of KB are tightly regulated both at transcriptional and hormonal levels.

New factors, such as circadian rhythms and paracrine signals, are emerging as important aspects of this metabolic regulation. However, KB are currently considered not only as energy substrates but also as signaling molecules. β-hydroxybutyrate has been identified as class I histone deacetylase inhibitor, thus establishing a connection between products of hepatic lipid metabolism and epigenetics.

However, several researchers are now focusing on the possibility to use KD in other diseases, such as cancer, neurological and metabolic disorders. Nonetheless, clear-cut evidence of the efficacy of KD in other disorders remains to be provided in order to suggest the adoption of such diets to metabolic-related pathologies.","Diets low in carbohydrates and proteins but high in fat stimulate the liver to make fat-related energy molecules called ketone bodies (KB). Ketone bodies are molecules used as alternate fuel to produce energy for tissues in the body. Making and using ketone bodies is carefully controlled within the body at the molecule and hormone level. One hormone, known as the master regulator of the process to develop ketone bodies, helps activate the cell networks that control fatty acids and ketogenesis, the process that creates ketone bodies. New factors, such as circadian rhythms (the natural cycle of mental and physical changes in the body over 24 hours) and paracrine signals (cell signaling to communicate with other cells nearby), are becoming important aspects of this metabolic regulation that controls and monitors cell energy stores.

47,34258332,"Background: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is an inborn disease caused by pathogenic variants in ALPL. Low levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are a biochemical hallmark of the disease. Scarce knowledge about the prevalence of HPP in Scandinavia exists, and the variable clinical presentations make diagnostics challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of ALPL variants as well as the clinical and biochemical features among adults with endocrinological diagnoses and persistent hypophosphatasaemia. Methods: A biochemical database containing ALP measurements of 26,121 individuals was reviewed to identify adults above 18 years of age with persistently low levels of ALP beneath range (≤ 35 ± 2.7 U/L). ALPL genetic testing, biochemical evaluations and assessment of clinical features by a systematic questionnaire among included patients, were performed. Results: Among 24 participants, thirteen subjects (54.2%) revealed a disease-causing variant in ALPL and reported mild clinical features of HPP, of which musculoskeletal pain was the most frequently reported (n = 9). The variant c. 571G > A; p.(Glu191 Lys) was identified in six subjects, and an unreported missense variant (c.1019A > C; p.(His340Pro)) as well as a deletion of exon 2 were detected by genetic screening. Biochemical analyses showed no significant differences in ALP (p = 0.059), the bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) (p = 0.056) and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) (p = 0.085) between patients with an ALPL variant and negative genetic screening. Patients with a variant in ALPL had significantly higher PLP levels than healthy controls (p = 0.002). We observed normal ALP activity in some patients classified as mild HPP, and slightly increased levels of PLP in two subjects with normal genetic screening and four healthy controls. Among 51 patients with persistent hypophosphatasaemia, fifteen subjects (29.4%) received antiresorptive treatment. Two patients with unrecognized HPP were treated with bisphosphonates and did not show complications due to the treatment. Conclusions: Pathogenic variants in ALPL are common among patients with endocrinological diagnoses and low ALP. Regarding diagnostics, genetic testing is necessary to identify mild HPP due to fluctuating biochemical findings. Antiresorptive treatment is a frequent reason for hypophosphatasaemia and effects of these agents in adults with a variant in ALPL and osteoporosis remain unclear and require further studies.","Low levels of blood phosphate, a high-energy molecule, or hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a from-birth disease caused by disease-causing variations in ALPL (the gene for alkaline phosphatase or a protein that influences phosphate levels). Low levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are a marker of HPP. Little is known about the amount of HPP in Scandinavia. The diverse symptoms make identification challenging. The study aimed to investigate the amount of ALPL variants and physical and biochemical markers among adults with hormonal diagnoses and persistant low ALP levels. We reviewed a database of ALP measurements from 26,121 individuals to identify adults over 18 years with persistently low levels of ALP. ALPL gene testing, biological tests, and assessment of symptoms by a questionnaire among included patients were performed. Among 24 patients, thirteen (54.2%) had a disease-causing variant in ALPL and mild symptoms of HPP, of which musculoskeletal pain was the most frequent. A specific gene mutation that altered a protein segment was found in six subjects. A similar gene mutation and deletion of a gene segment was detected by genetic tests. Tests showed no differences in ALP, bone-specific ALP, and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) or active vitamin B6 between patients with an ALPL mutation and no genetic diseases. Patients with an ALPL mutation had much higher PLP levels than healthy patients. We saw normal ALP activity in some patients with mild HPP. We also saw slightly increased PLP in two subjects with no gene diseases and four healthy patients. Among 51 with persistent low ALP levels, fifteen (29.4%) had anti-bone-breakdown treatment. Two patients with unrecognized HPP were treated with anti-bone-breakdown drugs and did not show side effects from treatment. Disease-causing mutations in ALPL are common in patients with hormonal diagnoses and low ALP. Regarding detection, gene testing is needed to identify mild HPP due to diverse biochemical findings. Anti-bone-breakdown treatment is frequent reason for low ALP levels and treatment effects in adults with an ALPL mutation and bone breakdown remain unclear and need further studies.","Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a disease caused by mutations within the gene ALPL. Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is the heritable, tooth and bone disease. The gene ALPL encodes for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an enzyme that helps bone strength. Low levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are a hallmark of the disease. There is little knowledge about the prevalence of HPP in Scandinavia. Due to the variation in HPP clinical presentations, diagnosing the disease is challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of ALPL variants (gene types). The study also aimed to identify HPP biological identifiers among adults. This study was specifically interested in adults with HPP along with endocrine (hormonal) disorders and persistent hypophosphatasemia (low body phosphorus levels). A database containing ALP measurements of 26,121 individuals was reviewed to identify adults above 18 years of age with persistently low levels of ALP. ALPL genetic testing, evaluation of body compound levels, and assessment of health by a systematic questionnaire among included patients, were performed. Among 24 participants, thirteen subjects revealed a disease-causing variant in ALPL and reported mild health effects of HPP. Of these mild health effects, musculoskeletal pain was the most frequently reported. The same genetic variant was identified in six subjects. An unreported missense (gene-altered) variant and a genetic deletion were detected by genetic screening. Analysis of compound levels within the body showed no significant differences between patients with an ALPL variant and negative (no-detection) genetic screening. Patients with a variant in ALPL had significantly higher PLP levels than control patients. Normal ALP activity was observed in some patients classified as mild HPP. A slightly increased level of PLP was found in two subjects with normal genetic screening and four healthy controls. Among 51 patients with persistent hypophosphatasemia, 15 received treatment to increase bone strength. Two patients with undiagnosed HPP were treated with bisphosphonates, drugs that slow bone loss. They did not show complications due to the treatment. Genetic variations in ALPL are common among patients with endocrine disorders and low ALP. Genetic testing is necessary to identify mild HPP due to fluctuating body compound level findings. Treatment to increase bone strength is a frequent reason for hypophosphatasemia. Effects of these agents in adults with a variant in ALPL and osteoporosis (brittle bones) remain unclear and require further studies."
9,32686966,"Objective: This study was designed to explore the clinical application of video laryngoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of throat foreign bodies (FBs). Method: In total, 1572 patients diagnosed with throat FBs at the Department of Otolaryngology of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital were retrospectively analysed. The covariables collected were the time from FB ingestion to admission, age, sex, duration of admission, and site of impaction. Result: The most common FBs were fish bones, which accounted for 1446 (91.98%) of 1572 FBs. Among all 1572 FBs, 1004 (63.87%) were successfully removed by video laryngoscopy without complications. A shorter duration of admission was associated with a higher diagnostic rate under video laryngoscopy. The diagnostic rate of sharp FBs was significantly higher than that of non-sharp FBs. The most common sites of throat FBs were the tongue root (42.29%), epiglottic vallecula (19.40%), tonsil (18.21%), and piriform fossa (10.65%). Conclusion: Video laryngoscopy is a powerful tool for the diagnosis and treatment of throat FBs, allowing for identification of rare locations of FBs as well as refractory FBs.","This work explored the use of video viewing of the voice box with a small device to identify and treat throat foreign bodies (FBs) or substances. 1572 total patients with throat foreign substances at the Department of Otolarynology of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital were analysed. Time from foreign substance consumption to hospital admission, age, sex, duration of admission, and site of blockage were measured. The most common foreign substance was fish bones, seen in 91.98% of patients. Among all 1572 foreign substances, 1004 (63.87%) were removed by video throat treatment with a small device without issues. A shorter hospital stay was linked to higher identification rate by video viewing of the voice box with a small device. The identification rate of sharp foreign substances was higher than that of non-sharp ones. The most common sites of throat foreign substances were areas near the tonsil and bottom of the tongue and throat. Video viewing of the voice box with a small device is powerful for identifying and treating throat foreign substances. It allows identification of rare locations of foreign substances and stubborn ones.","The study aimed to look at the use of a camera on the tip of a curved blade to diagnose and remove objects in the throat that shouldn’t be eaten. We studied 1572 people who had objects in the throat that shouldn't be eaten. We wrote down the time between eating the object and coming to the hospital, age, gender, how long the patient was in the hospital, and where the object was stuck. The most common objects stuck were fish bones, which made up 1446 (91.98%) of 1572 objects. Among all 1572 objects, 1004 (63.87%) were successfully removed using a camera on the tip of a curved blade without problems. When a camera on the tip of a curved blade was used to diagnose the object, people left the hospital sooner. Diagnosing sharp objects was higher than that of non-sharp objects. The most common place that objects were stuck in the throat were the far back and bottom of the tongue (42.29%), the space between the back of the tongue and the windpipe entrance (19.40%), the tonsil (18.21%), and the bottom of the throat (10.65%). We conclude that using a camera on the tip of a curved blade is a strong tool for the diagnosis and removal of objects in the throat that shouldn't be eaten, allowing for the finding of uncommon locations of objects and of objects not easily removed."
14,33232783,"Vitamin D is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that is exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for entry into the host cells. Further, vitamin D modulates multiple mechanisms of the immune system to contain the virus that includes dampening the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, reduces concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, enhances the production of natural antimicrobial peptide and activates defensive cells such as macrophages that could destroy SARS-CoV-2.","Vitamin D plays a key role in controlling blood pressure and fluid in the body and is used by SARS-CoV-2, the virus leading to the respiratory disease of COVID-19, for entry into cells. Vitamin D controls several processes of the immune system to minimize the virus. Examples include preventing entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus that can lead to COVID-19), reducing inflammation (the body's response to infection causing swelling, pain, or redness), and increasing the production of natural defensive cells in the body that could destroy SARS-CoV-2.",
24,2874976,"Buspirone hydrochloride (HCl)1 is a new anxiolytic with a unique chemical structure. Its mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Unlike the benzodiazepines, buspirone lacks hypnotic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant properties, and hence has been termed 'anxioselective'. As evidenced by a few double-blind clinical trials, buspirone 15 to 30 mg/day improves symptoms of anxiety assessed by standard rating scales similarly to diazepam, clorazepate, alprazolam and lorazepam. Like diazepam, buspirone is effective in patients with mixed anxiety/depression, although the number of patients studied to date is small. In several studies, a 'lagtime' of 1 to 2 weeks to the onset of anxiolytic effect has been noted; hence motivation of patient compliance may be necessary. Sedation occurs much less often after buspirone than after the benzodiazepines; other side effects are minor and infrequent. In healthy volunteers, buspirone does not impair psychomotor or cognitive function, and appears to have no additive effect with alcohol. Early evidence suggests that buspirone has limited potential for abuse and dependence. Thus, although only wider clinical use for longer periods of time will more clearly define some elements of its pharmacological profile, with its low incidence of sedation buspirone is a useful addition to the treatments available for generalised anxiety. It may well become the preferred therapy in patients in whom daytime alertness is particularly important.","Buspirone hydrochloride (HCL)1 is a new anti-anxiety drug with a unique molecular makeup. How it works is not yet fully understood. Unlike benzodiazepines, another type of drug to treat anxiety, buspirone is “anxioselective”; that is, it relieves anxiety without the side effects of benzodiazepines (sedation and muscle relaxation). As shown by a few clinical trials, buspirone 15 to 30 mg/day improves symptoms of anxiety using a standard questionnaire similarly to diazepam, clorazepate, alprazolam and lorazepam - other drugs that treat anxiety. Like diazepam, buspirone works in patients with anxiety and depression, although the number of patients studied is small. In many studies, it takes 1 to 2 weeks for anxiety relief after starting buspirone, so doctors may need to encourage patients to keep taking buspirone. Sedation happens much less often with buspirone than benzodiazepines, and other side effects are mild and uncommon. In healthy people, buspirone does not decrease mental processes and physical movement, and seems to not change with drinking alcohol. Early studies suggest buspirone is not likely to be abused or cause dependence. Although only more people taking buspirone for longer will show exactly how it works, it is another option to treat generalized anxiety because it rarely causes sedation. It could become the top treatment in patients who must be alert during the day.","Buspirone hydrochloride (HCl)1 is a new anxiety-reducing drug with a unique chemical structure. The mechanism of action for this anxiety-reducing drug is unknown. Unlike other anxiety-reducing drugs like benzodiazepines, buspirone lacks hypnotic, seizure-reducing, and muscle relaxant traits. Thus, the drug treats anxiety specifically. As shown in a few studies, 15 to 30 mg/day of buspirone improves anxiety symptoms similarly to other common anxiety-reducing drugs. Like anxiety-reducing diazepam, buspirone helps patients with mixed anxiety/depression. However, the number of patients studied is small. In many studies, the anxiety-reducing effect manifests after 1 to 2 weeks, so motivating patients to comply may be needed. Sedation is less frequent with buspirone than with other anxiety-reducing drugs. Other side effects are minor and infrequent. In healthy volunteers, buspirone does not affect movement or thought. It also appears to not strengthen the effects of alcohol. Buspirone may have limited potential for abuse and dependence. Thus, while more use will better define its effects, buspirone rarely leads to sedation and is a useful a treatment option for anxiety. Buspirone may become the preferred treatment for patients who demand daytime alertness."
8,24242756,"We present here a potential new treatment adjunct for glioblastoma. Building on murine studies, a series of papers appeared recently showing that therapeutic irradiation of the ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) retards growth of more peripherally growing cortical glioblastomas in humans, suggesting a tumor trophic function for the SVZ. Further studies showed that SVZ cells migrate out towards a peripheral glioblastoma. Dopamine signaling through D3 subtype receptor indirectly drives this centrifugal migration in humans. Since psychiatry has several drugs with good D3 blocking attributes, such as fluphenazine, or perphenazine, we suggest that adding one of these D3 blocking drugs to current standard treatment of resection followed by temozolomide and irradiation might prolong survival by depriving glioblastoma of the trophic functions previously subserved by dopaminergic signaling on SVZ cells.","We look at a possible new treatment to add to standard treatment for glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. Based on mouse studies, several recent studies showed that radiation of the part of the brain where brain cells are made reduces growth of some glioblastomas in humans, suggesting this part of the brain might play a role in fueling brain tumors. More studies showed cells from the part of the brain where brain cells are made move outward toward a glioblastoma. Certain molecule signaling causes this cell movement. Because many mental health drugs block molecule signaling, such as fluphenazine, or perphenazine, we suggest adding one of these drugs to the current standard treatment of surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation to possibly increase survival time by cutting off fuel to the glioblastoma.",
23,26835392,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency in the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). If left untreated, the main clinical feature is intellectual disability. Treatment, which includes a low Phe diet supplemented with amino acid formulas, commences soon after diagnosis within the first weeks of life. Although dietary treatment has been successful in preventing intellectual disability in early treated PKU patients, there are major issues with dietary compliance due to palatability of the diet. Other potential issues associated with dietary therapy include nutritional deficiencies especially vitamin D and B12. Suboptimal outcomes in cognitive and executive functioning have been reported in patients who adhere poorly to dietary therapy. There have been continuous attempts at improving the quality of medical foods including their palatability. Advances in dietary therapy such as the use of large neutral amino acids (LNAA) and glycomacropeptides (GMP; found within the whey fraction of bovine milk) have been explored. Gene therapy and enzyme replacement or substitution therapy have yielded more promising data in the recent years. In this review the current and possible future treatments for PKU are discussed.","Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited, metabolic disorder caused by a lack of a specific liver enzyme or protein.

While dietary treatment prevents intellectual disability in patients with early treated PKU, the diet is hard to follow due to its taste. Other issues with dietary treatment include deficiencies in vitamin D and B12. Patients that do not follow the diet experience low cognitive function. There have been many attempts to improve the diet including its taste. Changes like using new amino acids and protein units have been explored. Gene therapy and enzyme replacement have been more promising recently. This article reviews current and possible treatments for PKU.","Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disorder inherited from both parents in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy due to lack of a specific protein (phenylalanine hydroxylase, PAH) in the liver. PKU can cause intellectual disability if not treated. Treatment, which includes a low phenylalanine diet with formulas containing molecules that form proteins, begins soon after diagnosis within the first weeks of life. Although treatment diets prevent intellectual disability in PKU patients treated early, many patients do not follow the diets because they do not taste good. Treatment diets also may lack certain nutrients, especially vitamin D and B12. Patients who do not follow the diets generally show poorer performance in some mental skills. Work has been done to improve the quality of medical diets including their taste. Using certain molecules that form certain proteins are examples of ways to improve medical diets. Transferring genetic material into a patient's cell and replacing or substituting a substance that is lacking in the PKU patient's body have been successful in recent years.

22,28970150,"Germline mutations in the novel tumor suppressor gene FLCN are responsible for the autosomal dominant inherited disorder Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome that predisposes to fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax, and an increased risk for developing kidney tumors. Although the encoded protein, folliculin (FLCN), has no sequence homology to known functional domains, x-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the C-terminus of FLCN has structural similarity to DENN (differentially expressed in normal cells and neoplasia) domain proteins that act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for small Rab GTPases. FLCN forms a complex with folliculin interacting proteins 1 and 2 (FNIP1, FNIP2) and with 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This review summarizes FLCN functional studies which support a role for FLCN in diverse metabolic pathways and cellular processes that include modulation of the mTOR pathway, regulation of PGC1α and mitochondrial biogenesis, cell-cell adhesion and RhoA signaling, control of TFE3/TFEB transcriptional activity, amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1 on lysosomes through Rag GTPases, and regulation of autophagy. Ongoing research efforts are focused on clarifying the primary FLCN-associated pathway(s) that drives the development of fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and kidney tumors in BHD patients carrying germline FLCN mutations.","Changes in the gene called FLCN, which is a gene that suppresses tumor growth, are responsible for the inherited disorder Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. This syndrome makes people likely to get non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck and chest (fibrofolliculomas), cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs, sudden collapse of the lung, and an increased risk for developing tumors in the kidneys. Some parts of the gene protein, called folliculin, is shown to have a similar structure to other proteins called DENN. FLCN binds with folliculin proteins 1 and 2 (FNIP1, FNIP2) and with a protein kinase that is a critical molecule for energy sensing. This review summarizes other studies that have studied FLCN functions, including its role in how the body distributes nutrients and other cell processes. Ongoing research efforts focus on understanding the ways FLCN may lead to the development of fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts, and kidney tumors in Birt-Hogg-Dubé patients who have the FLCN mutation.","Heritable DNA mutations in the new tumor stopping gene FLCN lead to the genetic Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome.

Current research is on explaining the FLCN-associated pathway driving the creation of hair follicle tumors, lung cysts, and kidney tumors in BHD patients with heritable FLCN mutations."
15,31227226,"Total-body potassium (K+) content and appropriate distribution of K+ across the cell membrane is vitally important for normal cellular function. Total-body K+ content is determined by changes in excretion of K+ by the kidneys in response to intake levels. Under normal conditions, insulin and β-adrenergic tone also make important contributions in maintaining internal distribution of K+. However, despite these homeostatic pathways, disorders of altered K+ homeostasis are common. Appreciating the pathophysiology and regulatory influences that determine the internal distribution and external balance of K+ is critical in designing effective treatments to restore K+ homeostasis. We provide an up-to-date review of the regulatory aspects of normal K+ physiology as a preface to highlighting common disorders in K+ homeostasis and their treatment.

Despite these balance-maintaining pathways, disorders of altered potassium balance are common. Understanding the biological distribution and balance of K+ is crucial to designing treatments for it. We review the current biology of K+ to introduce common disorders in K+ balance and their treatment. ","The total-body content of potassium (K+) and distribution of K+ across the cell membranes (the thick layer that surrounds cells) is very important for normal functioning of the body's cells. Total-body K+ content (a method for measuring body composition and mass of cells) is determined by changes in the release of K+ by the kidneys in response to how much K+ is taken in. Insulin (a hormone that allows the cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar from the blood) and β-adrenergic tone (a group of organs and nerves where hormones are able to signal to other cells) also help keep potassium (K+) distribution at normal levels. Despite these different systems, disorders of changing K+ levels are common.

The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3-4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat.

Doctors might use a rapid strep test in people who are highly likely to have strep throat based on the sore throat scoring survey. If the rapid strep test shows no strep infection, a throat swab to find, grow, and test bacteria in the throat that make you sick is not needed. Advil or Tylenol can help short-term sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate should not be used in sore throat. It is unclear whether herbal treatments and acupuncture can help sore throat. People with less serious sore throat (low throat scoring survey score, for example) should not use antibiotics to help sore throat.

26,33176093,"Background: The efficacy of public health measures to control the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been well studied in young adults. Methods: We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infections among U.S. Marine Corps recruits who underwent a 2-week quarantine at home followed by a second supervised 2-week quarantine at a closed college campus that involved mask wearing, social distancing, and daily temperature and symptom monitoring. Study volunteers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by means of quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay of nares swab specimens obtained between the time of arrival and the second day of supervised quarantine and on days 7 and 14. Recruits who did not volunteer for the study underwent qPCR testing only on day 14, at the end of the quarantine period. We performed phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes obtained from infected study volunteers to identify clusters and to assess the epidemiologic features of infections. Results: A total of 1848 recruits volunteered to participate in the study; within 2 days after arrival on campus, 16 (0.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 15 of whom were asymptomatic. An additional 35 participants (1.9%) tested positive on day 7 or on day 14. Five of the 51 participants (9.8%) who tested positive at any time had symptoms in the week before a positive qPCR test. Of the recruits who declined to participate in the study, 26 (1.7%) of the 1554 recruits with available qPCR results tested positive on day 14. No SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified through clinical qPCR testing performed as a result of daily symptom monitoring. Analysis of 36 SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from 32 participants revealed six transmission clusters among 18 participants. Epidemiologic analysis supported multiple local transmission events, including transmission between roommates and among recruits within the same platoon. Conclusions: Among Marine Corps recruits, approximately 2% who had previously had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of supervised quarantine, and less than 2% of recruits with unknown previous status, tested positive by day 14. Most recruits who tested positive were asymptomatic, and no infections were detected through daily symptom monitoring. Transmission clusters occurred within platoons.","The strength of current public health measures to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or COVID-19 (a viral respiratory disease), has not been well studied in young adults. The authors investigated COVID-19 infections amongst U.S. Marine Corps recruits. These recruits underwent a two-week quarantine )or isolation) within their personal homes before participating in a second two-week quarantine. The second quarantine was supervised at a closed college campus where recruits wore masks, practiced social distancing, and received daily temperature and symptoms monitoring. Participants in the study were tested for COVID-19 by using nose swabs taken between the time of arrival and the second day of supervised quarantine. A second COVID-19 test run with nose swab samples was conducted on days 7 and 14. Marine recruits who did not want to participate in the study only received one COVID-19 test on day 14 (the final day of supervised quarantine). To identify clusters of unique COVID-19 cases and to better understand how the virus affects public health, the researchers studied the genetic makeup of COVID-19 within samples from the nose swabs. In total, 1848 recruits volunteered to participate in the study. Within the first two days of supervised quarantine, 16 recruits tested positive for (or had) COVID-19. Fifteen of the 16 positive cases did not show symptoms of illness. An additional 35 participants tested positive on day 7 or on day 14. Fifty-one participants tested positive at any time. Five of these patients had symptoms before their COVID-19 test returned positive. Of the recruits who declined to participate in the study, 26 of the 1554 recruits with available COVID-19 test results were positive on day 14. No COVID-19 infections were identified through clinical testing performed as a result of daily symptom monitoring. The evaluation of the genetic makeup of the virus identified six spreading clusters among 18 participants. Tracing of the virus transmission identified several spreading events, including between roommates and among recruits within the same platoon. The authors concluded that among the recruits, around 2% of those who had tested negative for (or did not have) COVID-19 on day 1 of supervised quarantine, along with 2% of those with unknown previous status, tested positive by day 14. Most recruits who tested positive showed no signs of illness. No infections were detected through daily symptom monitoring.

50,15337754,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is a phylogenetically highly conserved plasma protein, with homologs in vertebrates and many invertebrates, that participates in the systemic response to inflammation. Its plasma concentration increases during inflammatory states, a characteristic that has long been employed for clinical purposes. CRP is a pattern recognition molecule, binding to specific molecular configurations that are typically exposed during cell death or found on the surfaces of pathogens. Its rapid increase in synthesis within hours after tissue injury or infection suggests that it contributes to host defense and that it is part of the innate immune response. Recently, an association between minor CRP elevation and future major cardiovascular events has been recognized, leading to the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and the American Heart Association that patients at intermediate risk of coronary heart disease might benefit from measurement of CRP. This review will largely focus on our current understanding of the structure of CRP, its ligands, the effector molecules with which it interacts, and its apparent functions.","C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein that has remained relatively unchanged from evolution. CRP has similar forms in vertebrates and many invertebrates and participates in the systemic (full-body) response to inflammation (infection-fighting). Its plasma (blood) concentration increases during inflammation. This is a characteristic that has long been employed for clinical purposes. CRP is a pattern recognition molecule. This means CRP binds to specific molecular configurations typically found during cell death or on the surfaces of pathogens (foreign organisms). The rapid increase in CRP production within hours after tissue injury or infection suggests that it contributes to host defense. This also indicates that CRP is part of the innate immune response. Recently, an association between minor CRP elevation and future major heart-related events has been recognized. This has lead to government health agencies recommending that patients at intermediate risk of coronary heart disease (damage in the heart's major blood vessels) might benefit from measurement of CRP. This review focuses on the current understanding of the structure of CRP, the molecules it binds and interacts with, and its functions.",
16,26972611,"Corticosteroids have been used for decades to modulate inflammation therapeutically, yet there is a paucity of data on their effects in humans. We examined the changes in cellular and molecular immune system parameters, or ""immunome"", in healthy humans after systemic corticosteroid administration. We used multiplexed techniques to query the immunome in 20 volunteers at baseline, and after intravenous hydrocortisone (HC) administered at moderate (250 mg) and low (50 mg) doses, to provide insight into how corticosteroids exert their effects. We performed comprehensive phenotyping of 120 lymphocyte subsets by high dimensional flow cytometry, and observed a decline in circulating specific B and T cell subsets, which reached their nadir 4-8 hours after administration of HC. However, B and T cells rebounded above baseline 24 hours after HC infusion, while NK cell numbers remained stable. Whole transcriptome profiling revealed down regulation of NF-κB signaling, apoptosis, and cell death signaling transcripts that preceded lymphocyte population changes, with activation of NK cell and glucocorticoid receptor signaling transcripts. Our study is the first to systematically characterize the effects of corticosteroids on the human immunome, and we demonstrate that HC exerts differential effects on B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in humans. Fauci et al. reported that 400 mg and 100 mg doses of HC cause a transient nadir in circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes at 4–6 hours and recovery to baseline after 24 hours. Our data are consistent with these observations. We also observed differential effects of the two steroid doses on lymphocyte recovery at 24 hours, with total T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells rebounding above baseline after the 250 mg dose and total NK cells showing no increase above baseline at 24 hours. HC induced a rapid decline in circulating monocytes and mRNAs related to innate immune signaling as early as one hour after infusion. These effects preceded neutrophil demargination and lymphocyte depletion.","Steroid hormones have long been used to control inflammation, yet there is a shortage of data on their effects in humans. We examined the changes in cellular and molecular immune system measurements, or ""immunome"" in healthy humans after full-body steroid hormone treatment. We used multi-measurement techniques to find immune system measurements in 20 volunteers at baseline and after hydrocortisone (HC) (steroid hormone) treatment via blood vessel injection at moderate (250 mg) and low (50 mg) doses. We did this to understand how steroid hormones bring about their effects. We examine physical traits of 120 immune cell subsets by a specific molecular technique, and saw a decline in blood-specific, immune-cell subsets, which reached their minimum 4-8 hours after HC treatment. However, B and T immune cells increased above baseline 24 hours after HC treatment, while natural killer immune cell numbers did not change. A specific lab technique showed reduced protein signaling and cell death before immune-cell group sizes changed, with activation of natural killer immune cells and energy-monitoring, steroid hormone receptor molecules. Our study is the first to explore the effects of steroid hormones on human immune system measurements. We show that HC has different effects on human B and T immune cells and natural killer immune cells. Facui et al. showed that 400 mg and 100 mg doses of HC cause a temporary minimum in outer blood immune cells at 4-6 hours and recovery to baseline after 24 hours. Our data agree with these results. We also show different effects of the two steroid doses on immune cell recovery at 24 hours, with total T immune cells, specific sub-type T immune cells, and B immune cells increasing after the 250 mg dose. Also, total natural killer immune cells show no increases at 24 hours. HC leads to a rapid decline in white blood cells and pre-protein molecules related to immune signaling as early as one hour after treatment. These effects preexist migration and reduction of specific immune cell subtypes.","Corticosteroids (an anti-inflammatory drug or supplement to help relieve pain and swelling, also known as steroids) have been used for decades to relieve inflammation, yet there is little data on their effects in humans. Researchers examine the changes in cells and molecules of the immune system, also known as the immunome, in healthy humans after receiving systemic (affecting the entire body, rather than a single organ or body part) corticosteroids. Researchers use multiple ways to examine the immunome in 20 volunteers at baseline (the start of the study), and again after intravenous (medication delivered through the vein) hydrocortisone (steroid medication) given at moderate and low doses. A thorough review of cell characteristics of lymphocytes subsets (parts of a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system) saw a decline in B cell subsets that work with substances found in body fluids and in T-cell subsets that focus on specific foreign substances after receiving hydrocortisone. However, B and T cells rebounded or increased above baseline 24 hours after receiving hydrocortisone, while natural killer cell numbers (white blood cells that kill cells infected with a virus) remained stable. Additional analysis found several results: less responsive signaling from NF-κB (proteins involved in different cell functions including immunity responses), apoptosis (normal cell death), and cell death signaling that comes before changes in lymphocytes amount, with activation of signaling in natural killer cells and glucocorticoid receptors (receptors that regulates genes controlling development, metabolism, and immune response). This study is the first to methodically describe the effects of corticosteroids on the human immunome and showed that hydrocortisone has different effects on B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in humans. A different study reports that at certain doses, hydrocortisone can cause short-term low level in blood lymphocytes several hours after receiving the drug and return to baseline levels (at the start of the study) after 24 hours. Data from the present study have similar results. Different effects are found in the two steroid doses on lymphocytes returning to normal at 24 hours, with total T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells increasing above baseline after the high dose and total natural killer cells showing no increase above baseline at 24 hours. Hydrocortisone brings about a rapid decline in monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria) and mRNA (a strand of genetic code that provides instructions for building a protein) related to natural immune signaling as early as one hour after receiving the hydrocortisone. These effects come before neutrophil demargination, which increases white blood cells, and a reduction in lymphocytes."
55,7968718,"Abnormalities of Essential Fatty Acid (EFA) incorporation into phospholipid are found in chronic diseases. More recently changes in circulating EFA metabolites (EFAM) together with EFAM hypo-responsiveness of immune cells and EFAM production from cells have been found associated with disease. We hypothesize that changes in ratio of EFAMs are the normal physiological responses to stressors, but when stressors are excessive or prolonged, EFAM systems may become unpredictably hypo-responsive owing to factors such as receptor down regulation and substrate depletion. In time, many homeostatic system become deranged and held in that state by minor stressors. Literature review of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) shows hyper and hypo-responsiveness in immune function, several Hypothalamo-Pituitary (HP) axes and sympathetic nervous system, all relatable to dysfunctional changes in EFA metabolism. For the first time, we explain chronic immune system activation and hypo-responsive immune function in CFS; through EFAMs. Dietary EFA modulation (DEFA) can alter ratios of both membrane EFAs and produced EFAMs, and if maintained can restore hypo-responsive function. We discuss dietary strategies and relevance in CFS, and a case series of CFS patients applying DEFA with other titrated published managements which saw 90% gaining improvement within 3 months and more than 2/3 fit for full time duties.

41,30760828,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the leading genetic cause of renal failure. We have recently shown that inhibiting miR-17~92 is a potential novel therapeutic approach for ADPKD. However, miR-17~92 is a polycistronic cluster that encodes microRNAs (miRNAs) belonging to the miR-17, miR-18, miR-19 and miR-25 families, and the relative pathogenic contribution of these miRNA families to ADPKD progression is unknown. Here we performed an in vivo anti-miR screen to identify the miRNA drug targets within the miR-17~92 miRNA cluster. We designed anti-miRs to individually inhibit miR-17, miR-18, miR-19 or miR-25 families in an orthologous ADPKD model. Treatment with anti-miRs against the miR-17 family reduced cyst proliferation, kidney-weight-to-body-weight ratio and cyst index. In contrast, treatment with anti-miRs against the miR-18, 19, or 25 families did not affect cyst growth. Anti-miR-17 treatment recapitulated the gene expression pattern observed after miR-17~92 genetic deletion and was associated with upregulation of mitochondrial metabolism, suppression of the mTOR pathway, and inhibition of cyst-associated inflammation. Our results argue against functional cooperation between the various miR-17~92 cluster families in promoting cyst growth, and instead point to miR-17 family as the primary therapeutic target for ADPKD.","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited condition that causes multiple cysts (growths), usually in the liver, and is the leading genetic cause of kidney failure. Researchers have shown that slowing or stopping the gene miR-17~92 that is involved in cell growth and development is a possible new therapy to help people with ADPKD. However, miR-17~92 is a cluster of many cysts that influence microRNAs (miRNAs), which are RNA molecules that regulate genes and how genes make proteins. How these miRNA families contribute to the development and progression of ADPKD is unknown. In this study, researchers work to identify drugs that will focus on the miRNA. Researchers designed drugs called anti-miRs to individually stop or slow different types of miRNAs from functioning in a genetic model.

In contrast, treatment with anti-miRs against the miR-18, 19, or 25 families did not affect cyst growth. The anti-miR-17 treatment is associated with extending the lifespan of energy from certain cells, stopping or slowing cell growth often found in tumors, and stopping or slowing inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) associated with cysts.

32,15226090,"Objectives: Elevated plasma homocysteine has been implicated as a risk factor for hypertension. C677T polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) is a major determinant of hyperhomocysteinemia, which results in endothelial dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to remedy the endothelial dysfunction and restore endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. The co-existence of genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes, targets, receptors, and transporters may influence the drug efficacy. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether short-term blood pressure control by benazepril, an ACE inhibitor, was modulated by C677T MTHFR gene polymorphism. Methods and results: A total of 444 hypertensive patients, aged 27 to 65 years, without any anti hypertensive therapy within 2 weeks were included. All of them were treated orally with benazepril at a single daily fixed dosage of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured at baseline and on the 16th day of treatment. Among them, the frequency of MTHFR C677T genotype CC, CT and TT was 24.3%, 51.8%, and 23.9%, respectively. In a recessive model (CC+CT versus TT genotype), both baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and diastolic blood pressure response (DeltaDBP) were significantly higher in patients with the TT genotype than in those with the CT or CC genotype (P value=0.0076 for DBP, and P value=0.0005 for DeltaDBP). We further divided all patients into three groups based on the tertiles of the DeltaBP distribution. Compared to subjects in the lowest tertile of DeltaDBP, the adjusted relative odds of having the TT genotype among subjects in the highest tertile was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.4 to 4.9). However, baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and SBP response did not significantly associate with MTHFR C677T polymorphism. Conclusions: Our finding suggests that MTHFR C667T polymorphism modulated baseline DBP and DBP responsiveness by short-term treatment of ACE inhibitor in Chinese essential hypertensive patients.","Increased blood levels of homocysteine, a specific chemical, may be a risk factor for high blood pressure. A specific mutation in DNA (C677T) encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a protein that transforms homocysteine, greatly influences hyperhomocysteinemia, or high blood levels of homocysteine. This condition results in damage to cells that line the heart and blood vessels. Blood pressure medication called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors seem to repair damage to cells lining the heart and blood vessels and restore blood vessel widening. The co-existence of varied DNA for drug-digesting enzymes, targets, target sites, and transporters may affect drug effect. This study investigates if short-term blood pressure control by benazepril, an ACE inhibitor, was affected by variation in the DNA sequence for the C667T MTHFR gene. 444 patients with high blood pressure, aged 27 to 65 years, without any high blood pressure therapy within 2 weeks were included. All of them swallowed benazepril at a single daily fixed dose of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured at start and on the 16th day of treatment. Among them, the gene sequence for MTHFR C677T varied. Diastolic blood pressure at the start and end were much higher for patients with a certain DNA sequence for the MTHFR C677T gene than patients with two other DNA sequences. We then divided all patients into 3 groups based on the distribution of blood pressure readings at the study's end. Compared to those with the lowest blood pressure measurements, the chances of having a certain DNA sequence for the MTHFR C667T gene among those with the highest blood pressure readings was 2.6 times higher. However, systolic blood pressure at the start and end was not linked to DNA sequences. DNA sequence variation for the MTHFR C667T gene affects diastolic blood pressure at the study's start and end in Chinese essential patients with high blood pressure.","Increase plasma, or blood, homocysteine has been identified as a risk factor for hypertension (high blood pressure). Homocysteine is a chemical your body produces to help make proteins. An identified genetic variation or gene type within the human population is a major determinant of hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a condition with excess homocysteine in the blood. The condition can result in endothelial dysfunction, or a heart disease where the blood vessels narrow instead of opening. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a type of drug commonly used to treat high blood pressure. ACE Inhibitors appear to fix the endothelial (or blood vessel lining) dysfunction and allow blood vessels to open. The presence of the genetic variation in specific bodily locations that metabolize or digest drugs, such as enzymes and receptors, may influence how well a drug works. The goal of this study was to investigate if short-term blood pressure control by an ACE inhibitor (Benazepril) is effected by the identified genetic variation. A total of 444 hypertensive patients, aged 27 to 65 years, without any anti hypertensive therapy within 2 weeks were included. All patients were treated with Benazepril with a single, daily dose of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured prior to the study beginning (baseline) and on the 16th day of treatment. The unique genetic variation has three unique ""versions"" or genotypes, known as CC, CT, or TT. Among the patients, the frequency of the genetic variation genotype CC, CT, and TT was 24.3%, 51.8%, and 23.9%, respectively. In a statistical analysis, several blood pressure measurements were higher in patients with the TT genotype than those with the CT or CC genotype. The authors further divided all patients into three groups based on where their diastolic blood pressure response (DeltaDBP) fell within a population scale. Diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure when the heart is relaxed. Patients with the highest DeltaDBP had the highest chance of having the TT genotype. However, baseline systolic blood pressure (when the heart is contracting) was not significantly associated with the unique genetic variation. This study suggests that the unique genetic variation altered baseline DBP by short-term treatment of ACE inhibitor in hypertensive patients."
6,32740045,"Purpose of review: The aim of the article is to present the basics of oral levothyroxine (LT4) absorption, reasons why patients may have persistently elevated serum thyroid stimulation hormone (TSH) levels, and alternative strategies for LT4 dosing. Recent findings: Although oral LT4 tablets are most commonly used for thyroid hormone replacement in patients with hypothyroidism, case studies report that liquid oral LT4, intravenous, intramuscular, and rectal administration of LT4 can successfully treat refractory hypothyroidism. Summary: Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders encountered by primary care physicians and endocrinologists. LT4 is one of the most widely prescribed medications in the world and it is the standard of care treatment for hypothyroidism. Generally, hypothyroid patients will be treated with LT4 tablets to be taken orally, and monitoring will occur with routine serum thyroid tests, including TSH concentrations. However, many patients fail to maintain serum TSH levels in the target range while managed on oral LT4 tablets. A subset of these patients would be considered to have poorly controlled hypothyroidism, sometimes termed refractory hypothyroidism. For these patients, optimization of ingestion routines and alternative formulations and routes of administration of LT4 can be considered, including oral liquid, intravenous, intramuscular, and even rectal formulations.","This article aims to cover the basics of how well levothyroxine (LT4 - a common thyroid medication) is absorbed when taken by mouth, reasons why people may have continuously high blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, and other ways to take levothyroxine. Although LT4 tablets taken by mouth are most commonly used for thyroid hormone replacement in people with underactive thyroids, studies show that taking LT4 in liquid-form by mouth, shot to a vein or muscle, and through the rectum can work to treat poorly-controlled underactive thyroid. Underactive thyroid is one of the most common hormone disorders doctors see. LT4 is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world and is the recommended treatment for underactive thyroid. Generally, people with underactive thyroids will take LT4 tablets by mouth and track thryoid levels with common blood thyroid tests, including measuring levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Taking LT4 tablets by mouth does not keep blood thyroid-stimulating hormone levels at the right level for many people. Some of these people may have poorly-controlled underactive thyroids, or refractory underactive thyroids. This group of people might need to take LT4 in other forms or other ways, including liquid-form by mouth, shot to a vein or muscle, or even through the rectum.",
28,34562551,"Some COVID-19 patients suffer complications from anti-viral immune responses which can lead to both a dangerous cytokine storm and development of blood-borne factors that render severe thrombotic events more likely. The precise immune response profile is likely, therefore, to determine and predict patient outcomes and also represents a target for intervention. Anti-viral T cell exhaustion in the early stages is associated with disease progression. Dysregulation of T cell functions, which precedes cytokine storm development and neutrophil expansion in alveolar tissues heralds damaging pathology. T cell function, cytokine production and factors that attract neutrophils to the lung can be modified through targeting molecules that can modulate T cell responses. Manipulating T cell responses by targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway could provide the means to control the immune response in COVID-19 patients. During the initial anti-viral response, T cell effector function can be enhanced by delaying anti-viral exhaustion through inhibiting PI3K and Akt. Additionally, immune dysregulation can be addressed by enhancing immune suppressor functions by targeting downstream mTOR, an important intracellular modulator of cellular metabolism. Targeting this signalling pathway also has potential to prevent formation of thrombi due to its role in platelet activation. Furthermore, this signalling pathway is essential for SARS-cov-2 virus replication in host cells and its inhibition could, therefore, reduce viral load. The ultimate goal is to identify targets that can quickly control the immune response in COVID-19 patients to improve patient outcome. Targeting different levels of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway could potentially achieve this during each stage of the disease.","Some patients suffer complications from anti-viral immune responses, or the response their body creates when infected with a virus. These complications can lead to both a dangerous cytokine storm (proteins that control activity of immune and blood cells that flood the body) and development of blood-borne factors that increase the likelihood of blood clots or scabs. Each person's unique immune response will likely determine and predict how a patient will react to infection. Therefore, each person's immune system represents a target for intervention to prevent harmful side effects. In the early stages of infection, exhausted or overworked T cells (an immune system cell) can lead to disease progression. Alteration of T cell functions often comes before a cytokine storm and neutrophil expansion, or the suppression of immune system. When these events occur in lung tissues, diseases are often even more damaging. T cell function, cytokine production, and events that attract neutrophils (cells that sweep humans for signs of infection) to the lung can be changed by specifically targeting molecules that trigger T cell responses. Manipulating T cell responses could provide the means to control the immune response in patients with COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disorder). During the initial anti-viral response, T cell function can be enhanced by delaying anti-viral exhaustion by suppressing certain biological pathways. Additionally, immune dysregulation or errors can be addressed by enhancing immune suppressor functions by targeting molecules that control cell metabolism. Targeting cell metabolism pathways may also prevent formation of blood clots. Furthermore, the cell metabolism pathway is needed for COVID-19 replication in host cells. Suppressing the pathway could potentially decrease the amount of virus within the host. The overall goal is to identify biological targets than can control the immune response in COVID-19 patients to improve patient well-being. Targeting specific pathways in the body could achieve this goal during each stage of the disease.","Some patients of COVID-19 (a respiratory viral illness) suffer issues from anti-viral immune responses. These can lead to a dangerous inflammatory molecule overproduction and blood-borne substances that increase blood clotting risk. The exact immune response type may determine and predict patient outcomes. It may also be a target for treatment. Elimination of specific anti-viral immune cells called T cells in the early stages is linked with disease progression. Damaged T cell function, which is before inflammatory molecule overproduction and expansion in lungs, signals harmful disease effects. T cell function, inflammatory molecule production and attraction to the lung can be changed by targeting molecules that can alter responses of specific immune cells. Changing T cell responses by targeting a specific pathway may help control the immune response in COVID-19 patients. During initial anti-viral response, specific T cell function can be improved by delaying anti-viral elimination by blocking a specific cell pathway. Also, immune system impairment can be addressed by improving functions to suppress the immune response. This can be done by targeting a specific molecule that influences cellular metabolism. Targeting this specific cell signaling pathway may prevent blood clotting. Also, this cellular pathway is needed for the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Blocking the pathway could reduce virus amount. The end goal is to identify targets that can quickly control the immune response in COVID-19 patients to improve patient outcome. Targeting different parts of a specific cellular pathway could achieve this immune response control at each stage of the disease."
30,32840002,"Background: Nucleic acid persists after symptom resolution and infectivity for many viral infections via delayed clearance of nucleic acid fragments, non-infectious particles, or transmissible virus. For Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the relationship between nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positivity, the development of antibodies against COVID-19, and clinical history are unclear. Study design and methods: Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and volunteered to donate convalescent plasma (CP) were screened by NP swab PCR, responded to a questionnaire, and were tested for anti-COVID-19 antibodies. Results: A proportion of 11.8% of individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NP swab PCR greater than 14 days after the resolution of symptoms of active disease, including one donor who had asymptomatic disease and tested positive by NP swab 41 days after her initial diagnosis. Clinical history did not show a significant correlation with persistence of NP swab positivity. Also, NP swab positivity >14 days from symptom resolution did not correlate with anti-COVID-19 serology results. IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody strength correlated with hospitalization for COVID-19 using two different assays. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody strength correlated with time from symptom resolution to sample collection and symptom duration. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is detectable long after the resolution of symptoms in a significant percentage of previously diagnosed individuals, which is important to consider when interpreting PCR swab results. Persistence of PCR positivity does not correlate with antibody strength or symptoms of COVID-19. If anti-spike antibody is used to assess CP potency, individuals who suffered severe COVID-19 disease symptoms may represent better donors.","For many infections from viruses, traces of the infection can remain in the body after symptoms and transmission (or spread) to others stop. For Covid-19 (a viral, respiratory illness), the relationship between a positive (or virus-detected) nasal swab where a sample is taken from the back of the nose and throat, the development of antibodies (proteins in the body) that fight Covid-19, and the clinical history is unclear. In this study, people who recovered from Covid-19 and volunteered to donate plasma (the liquid part of blood) are screened for genetic material of the virus using a nasal swab. These volunteers also answer a series of questions and are tested for Covid-19 antibodies. There are 11.8% who tested positive for coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, using a nasal swab 14 days after symptoms stopped. Medical history does not show a big association with ongoing positive nasal swab tests. Also, a positive nasal swab >14 days after symptoms stop is not correlated with antibodies against Covid-19 in the plasma. A test measuring the increase of antibodies against Covid-19 relates with being in the hospital for Covid-19. Antibodies against Covid-19 corresponded with time after symptoms stopped to when the samples are collected and how long symptoms lasted. In conclusion, traces of genetic material from coronavirus can be found long after symptoms end in a significant percentage of people who have been diagnosed, which is important to remember when reading swab test results. Continuing to test positive does not correspond with antibody strength or symptoms of Covid-19. If measuring antibodies is used to understand plasma strength, individuals who have had serious Covid-19 disease symptoms may be better donors or donators.",

The reasons why people with no COVID-19 related symptoms test positive for the virus are unknown. However, it is known that people with no COVID-19 related symptoms can still spread the virus to others.

6,29381251,"Objective: Hypothyroidism is relatively common, occurring in approximately 5% of the general US population aged ≥12 years. Levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy is the standard of care. Approximately, 5%-10% of patients who normalise thyroid-stimulating hormone levels with LT4 monotherapy may have persistent symptoms that patients and clinicians may attribute to hypothyroidism. A long-standing debate in the literature is whether addition of levotriiodothyronine (LT3) to LT4 will ameliorate lingering symptoms. Here, we explore the evidence for and against LT4/LT3 combination therapy as the optimal approach to treat euthyroid patients with persistent complaints. Methods: Recent literature indexed on PubMed was searched in March 2017 using the terms ""hypothyroid"" or ""hypothyroidism"" and ""triiodothyronine combination"" or ""T3 combination."" Relevant non-review articles published in English during the past 10 years were included and supplemented with articles already known to the authors. Findings: Current clinical evidence is not sufficiently strong to support LT4/LT3 combination therapy in patients with hypothyroidism. Polymorphisms in deiodinase genes that encode the enzymes that convert T4 to T3 in the periphery may provide potential mechanisms underlying unsatisfactory treatment results with LT4 monotherapy. However, results of studies on the effect of LT4/LT3 therapy on clinical symptoms and thyroid-responsive genes have thus far not been conclusive. Conclusions: Persistent symptoms in patients who are biochemically euthyroid with LT4 monotherapy may be caused by several other conditions unrelated to thyroid function, and their cause should be aggressively investigated by the clinician.","Low thyroid function occurs in around 5% of the US population aged ≥12 years. Levothyroxine (LT4) (a thyroid hormonal drug) is standard treatment. Around 5-10% of patients with regular thyroid-stimulating hormone levels after LT4 may still have symptoms attributable to reduced thyroid funciton. Experts debate if adding levotriiodothyronine (LT3), another manmade thyroid hormone, to LT4 will help lingering symptoms. We explore evidence for and against LT4/LT3 double treatment for best treating patients with lingering thyroid issues. We searched PubMed in March 2017 using the terms ""hypothyroid"" or ""hypothyroidism"" (low thyroid function) and ""triiodothyronine combination"" or ""T3 combination"" (thyroid hormonal drug therapy). Current evidence does not support LT4/LT3 double treatment for those with reduced thyroid function. Variations in genes blueprinting enzymes that convert thyroid hormone from one form to another may explain the lack of improvement with LT4 treatment. However, studies of LT4/LT3 double treatment are not conclusive. Lingering symptoms in patients with normal thyroids from LT4 therapy may be from other thyroid-unrelated causes, which should be investigated by the clinician.","Underactive thyroid is relatively common, occurring in about 5% of the general U.S. population 12 years and older.

About 5%-10% of patients who use LT4 alone to regulate thyroid-stimulating hormone levels may have ongoing symptoms that patients and doctors may think are caused by underactive thyroid. Science disagrees as to whether addition of levotriiodothyronine (LT3 - another thryoid medication) to LT4 will improve these ongoing symptoms. We look at whether combining LT4 and LT3 is the best way to treat patients with normal thyroid function but ongoing symptoms. We searched PubMed in March 2017 using the terms ""hypothyroid"" or ""hypothyroidism"" and ""triiodothyronine combination"" or ""T3 combination."" We looked at English articles in the last 10 years in addition to known articles. We did not find strong proof that combining LT4 and LT3 worked to treat patients with underactive thyroids. Genes that cause less conversion of T4 to T3 may explain unsuccessful treatment with LT4. The benefit of adding LT3 to LT4 treatment is uncertain. Ongoing symptoms in patients with normal thyroid function may be due to other causes. A doctor should determine the cause of the ongoing symptoms."

Thus, potassium homeostasis across the cell membrane, is very critical because a tilt in this balance can result in different diseases that could be life threatening. Both Oxidative stress (OS) and potassium imbalance can cause life threatening health conditions. OS and abnormalities in potassium channel have been reported in neurodegenerative diseases. This review highlights the major factors involved in potassium homeostasis (dietary, hormonal, genetic, and physiologic influences), and discusses the major diseases and abnormalities associated with potassium imbalance including hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and Gordon's syndrome, Bartter syndrome, and Gitelman syndrome.","There is a lot of potassium (a mineral the body needs to function well) in the fluid within cells.

However, the impacts of such deficiencies on the etiology of the disease have been the object of intense debates. The aim of the present review is first to highlight the general consensus on fatty acid dysregulations that emerges from, sometimes apparently contradictory, studies. In a second step, a unifying mechanism for the potential impacts of these fatty acid dysregulations in CF cells, based on alterations of membrane biophysical properties (known as lipointoxication), is proposed.

34,33388899,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent worldwide public burden that increasingly compromises overall health as the disease progresses. Two of the most negatively affected tissues are bone and skeletal muscle, with CKD negatively impacting their structure, function and activity, impairing the quality of life of these patients and contributing to morbidity and mortality. Whereas skeletal health in this population has conventionally been associated with bone and mineral disorders, sarcopenia has been observed to impact skeletal muscle health in CKD. Indeed, bone and muscle tissues are linked anatomically and physiologically, and together regulate functional and metabolic mechanisms. With the initial crosstalk between the skeleton and muscle proposed to explain bone formation through muscle contraction, it is now understood that this communication occurs through the interaction of myokines and osteokines, with the skeletal muscle secretome playing a pivotal role in the regulation of bone activity. Regular exercise has been reported to be beneficial to overall health. Also, the positive regulatory effect that exercise has been proposed to have on bone and muscle anatomical, functional, and metabolic activity has led to the proposal of regular physical exercise as a therapeutic strategy for muscle and bone-related disorders. The detection of bone- and muscle-derived cytokine secretion following physical exercise has strengthened the idea of a cross communication between these organs. Hence, this review presents an overview of the impact of CKD in bone and skeletal muscle, and narrates how these tissues intrinsically communicate with each other, with focus on the potential effect of exercise in the modulation of this intercommunication.","Chronic kidney disease is a common health condition around the world and impacts the overall health of a person as the disease gets worse. Bones and muscles attached to bones are tissues highly affected by chronic kidney disease, which damages their functions and activities and contributes to poor quality of life.

Bone and muscle tissues are linked in the body, and together, they regulate systems in the body that help the body function and process and distribute nutrients. The skeletal muscle cells release small proteins that regulate different parts of the body, including bone activity. Regular exercise is found to be beneficial to overall health.

49,33958571,"BACKGROUND Lipedema is a common condition that presents as excessive fat deposition in the extremities, initially sparing the trunk, ankles, and feet, and is found mainly in women, usually occurring after puberty or pregnancy. Lipedema can progress to include lipo-lymphedema of the ankles and feet. This report is of a 41-year old woman with Stage 3 lipedema and lipo-lymphedema with excessive fat of the lower body since puberty, with progression to swollen ankles and feet despite dietary caloric restriction. CASE REPORT A 41-year-old woman noticed increased fat in her legs since age 12. Her weight and leg size increased until age 21, when she reached a maximum weight of 165 kg, and underwent a Roux-En-Y gastric bypass. Over 12 months, she lost 74.8 kg. Her trunk significantly reduced in weight, but her legs did not. Fifteen years later, during recovery from hysterectomy surgery, she became progressively weaker and swollen over her entire body. Laboratory test results showed hypoalbuminemia (2.0 g/dL), lymphopenia, and hypolipoproteinemia. She was diagnosed with protein and calorie malnutrition with marked gut edema requiring prolonged parenteral nutrition. After restoration of normal protein, her health returned and her pitting edema resolved, but her extremities remained enlarged. She was subsequently diagnosed with lipedema. CONCLUSIONS This report demonstrates that early and correct diagnosis of lipedema is important, as women who believe the condition is due to obesity may suffer the consequences of calorie or protein-calorie deficiency in an attempt to lose weight.","Lipedema is a common condition where there is too much fat in the arms and legs and is found mainly in women, usually occurring after puberty (when a child's body changes to become an adult) or pregnancy. Lipedema can progress to include lipo-lymphedema, which is a build up of fluid in addition to excess fat, in the ankles and feet. This report is of a 41-year old woman with Stage 3 lipedema and lipo-lymphedema with excessive fat of the lower body since puberty. The woman's condition has advanced to swollen ankles and feet despite being on a low calorie diet. The 41-year-old woman noticed increased fat in her legs since age 12. Her weight and leg size increased until age 21, when she reached a maximum weight of 364 pounds (165 kg), and had a procedure called gastric bypass that involves a doctor placing a small pouch in the stomach and food only goes into that pouch. Over 12 months, she lost 165 pounds (74.8 kg). Her trunk (chest, stomach, and back) significantly reduced in weight, but her legs did not. Fifteen years later, during recovery from surgery, she became continuously weaker and swollen over her entire body. Lab test results showed hypoalbuminemia (low levels of the albumin protein in the blood), making it harder to move substances in the body. Tests also show low levels of white blood cells and low levels of fat lipids in the blood. She was not eating enough protein and energy (through calories) to meet nutritional needs with edema (swelling) in the stomach, requiring that more nutrition be given through the vein. After restoring protein to normal levels, her health returned and her pitting edema due to excess fluid resolved, but her arms and legs remained enlarged. She was later diagnosed with lipedema. In conclusion, this report shows that early and correct diagnosis of lipedema is important. Women who believe the condition is due to obesity may suffer from not enough calorie or protein-calories in an attempt to lose weight.",
10,21493175,"Objective: To identify through case study the presentation and possible pathophysiological cause of complex regional pain syndrome and its preferential response to stellate ganglion blockade. Setting: Complex regional pain syndrome can occur in an extremity after minor injury, fracture, surgery, peripheral nerve insult or spontaneously and is characterised by spontaneous pain, changes in skin temperature and colour, oedema, and motor disturbances. Pathophysiology is likely to involve peripheral and central components and neurological and inflammatory elements. There is no consistent approach to treatment with a wide variety of specialists involved. Diagnosis can be difficult, with over-diagnosis resulting from undue emphasis placed upon pain disproportionate to an inciting event despite the absence of other symptoms or under-diagnosed when subtle symptoms are not recognised. The International Association for the Study of Pain supports the use of sympathetic blocks to reduce sympathetic nervous system overactivity and relieve complex regional pain symptoms. Educational reviews promote stellate ganglion blockade as beneficial. Three blocks were given at 8, 10 and 13 months after the initial injury under local anaesthesia and sterile conditions. Physiotherapeutic input was delivered under block conditions to maximise joint and tissue mobility and facilitate restoration of function. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the need for practitioners from all disciplines to be able to identify the clinical characteristics of complex regional pain syndrome to instigate immediate treatment and supports the notion that stellate ganglion blockade is preferable to upper limb intravenous regional anaesthetic block for refractory index finger pain associated with complex regional pain syndrome.","The objective of this case report (a summary of an individual patient's symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment) is to identify the sign or symptoms and causes of complex regional pain syndrome (a form of ongoing pain that affects the arm or leg) and if a pain treatment called stellate ganglion blockade (an injection of medication into nerves at the front of the neck that can relieve pain) has any effect on the pain. Complex regional pain syndrome can occur in the arms or legs after a minor injury, fracture, surgery, or nerve damage. It appears as sudden, random pain, changes in skin temperatures and color, swelling in ankles, feet or legs, and uncontrollable movements in the body. Disease-related physical changes are likely to involve outer and central parts, nerve-related elements, and inflammatory elements, the body's natural response to injury or infection. There is no consistent approach to treatment with a wide variety of specialists involved. Diagnosis can be difficult. Sometimes it is over-diagnosed (diagnosis of a medical condition that would never have caused any symptoms or problems) from too much attention on the pain even though other symptoms are not present. Sometimes it can be under-diagnosed (diagnosed less often than its occurrence) when less obvious symptioms are not recognized. A professional medical association for the study of pain supports the kind of pain block used in stellate ganglion blockade to reduce sensory nerves and relieve pain sympoms. Educational reviews promote stellate ganglion blockade as beneficial. Three blocks (injections) were given at 8, 10 and 13 months after the initial injury under local anaesthesia and clean conditions. Physical therapy was provided after the patient received an injection to allow more movement of the joint and tissues and to help restore use of the injured finger. This case shows that healthcare providers need to be able to identify clinical signs of complex regional pain syndrome to start treatment immediately. It also shows that stellate ganglion blockade is a preferable method to an IV of local anaesthetic (one-time injection of medicine that numbs a small area of the body) in the upper arm to help finger pain associated with complex regional pain syndrome.",
31,29996156,"Tardive dyskinesias (TDs) are still common long-term sequelae of antipsychotic treatment. They are generally irreversible and associated with cognitive deficits, a decrease in quality of life and increased mortality. Furthermore, they potentially contribute to further stigmatization of the affected patients. However due to limited treatment options, antipsychotic drugs are still one of the cornerstones in treatment of most severe mental illnesses. Therefore, knowledge about risk factors and prevention of TDs is crucial. If TDs occur, the immediate optimization of the antipsychotic drug regimen is required. Targeted medical treatments such as VMAT - 2 inhibitors can be considered. The novel VMAT-2 inhibitors are not yet approved in Germany. Other drugs that are currently used to treat TDs include clonazepam and gingko biloba. This review summarizes the current evidence of treatment options of TDs and seeks to formulate clinical recommendations for the prevention and management of TDs.","Tardive dyskinesias (TDs) - movement disorders - are still common long-term consequences of antipsychotic drugs. TDs generally cannot be reversed and are linked with intellectual disabilities, decreased quality of life and increased death.

Because of a lack of treatment options, antipsychotic drugs are still one of the main treatments for serious mental illness. Therefore, knowing about TD risk factors and prevention is very important. IF TDs happen, the amount of antipsychotic drugs prescribed must be changed quickly to an appropriate amount. Specialized drugs such as vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT - 2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), can be used. Germany has not yet approved the new VMAT-2 inhibitors. Clonazepam and gingko biloba, used for seizures and memory problems, respectively, are other drugs that can be used to treat TDs. We summarize the current data on TD treatment options and try to come up with recommendations for doctors to prevent and treat TDs.",

Exploring the mechanism of coronavirus damage to the nervous system is essential for reducing the long-term neurological complications of COVID-19. Despite rapid progress in characterizing SARS-CoV-2, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the brain remain unclear. The possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 injury to the central nervous system include: 1) direct injury of nerve cells, 2) activation of the immune system and inflammatory cytokines caused by systemic infection, 3) a high affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein for the angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE2, 4) cerebrovascular disease caused by hypoxia and coagulation dysfunction, and 5) a systemic inflammatory response that promotes cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases. Although we do not fully understand the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes nerve injury, we hope to provide a framework by reviewing the clinical manifestations, complications, and possible mechanisms of neurological damage caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Exploring how coronavirus damages the nervous system is essential to reduce the long-term damage from COVID-19, or SARS-CoV-2 illness, to the nervous system. Despite rapid progress in describing SARS-CoV-2, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the brain is unclear. Some ways SARS-CoV-2 may injure the brain and spinal cord are: 1) directly harming nerve cells, 2) activating the immune system and inflammatory molecules from full-body infection, 3) binding of the virus to a specific molecule, 4) damaged blood flow in the brain due to reduced oxygen and blood clotting, and 5) full-body inflammation leading to cognitive damage and harmful nervous system diseases. While we do not fully know how SARS-CoV-2 causes nerve injury, we hope to lay the groundwork by reviewing clinical symptoms, issues, and possible methods for nerve damage caused by SARS-CoV-2.

It has threatened public health and drawn worldwide attention. The short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 on the nervous system pose major public health challenges. Patients with COVID-19 present a wide range of symptoms of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). It is essential to better understand how COVID-19 affects the nervous system. Increasing current understanding will reduce the long-term effects COVID-19 may cause within the brain. Despite rapid progress in better understanding how COVID-19 hurts the human body, the long-term effects of the virus on the brain are still unclear. There are several possible ways COVID-19 affects the central nervous system. One of these ways is by potentially hurting nerve cells. Second, the virus may cause body-wide inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) that may activate the immune system. Third, COVID-19 may be highly attracted to a specific pathway into cells and can then rapidly distribute throughout the body. Fourth, the virus may cause disease by decreasing oxygen and increase blood clotting within the body. And lastly, COVID-19 may cause body-wide inflammation that decreases brain function. Despite not fully understanding how COVID-19 causes nerve injury, the authors hoped to provide a review of clinical reports, documented human health effects, and potential pathways of COVID-19-caused brain damage. The aim of this paper was to assist in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19-caused brain damage.

51,8003613,"Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is associated with the formation of autoantibodies against different antigens in the islets of Langerhans, so-called islet cell antibodies (ICA). The expression of a major autoantigen, the beta-cell specific enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), is glucose-dependent in vitro and correlated to insulin release in vitro. In this study the expression of islet autoantigens was examined in vivo and the relationship between beta-cell function and islet cell surface antibody (ICSA) reactivity was tested. Rats were fed for 10 days with glipizide or diazoxide, in order to stimulate or inhibit insulin release, respectively. Frozen sections of pancreata were incubated with ten ICA-positive IDDM sera and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. Two sera with a ""beta-cell restricted"" staining, five with an ""all-islet cell"" staining and three with a ""mixed"" pattern were employed. In all three groups, the highest end-point titres were obtained when pancreata of rats treated with glipizide were used. Intermediate titres were seen in control animals and the lowest titres were observed on pancreata from diazoxide-treated rats, regardless of the serum used. In contrast to these observations, no correlation between ICSA reactivity and islet cell activity could be demonstrated.

However, these portals remain the least well-characterized part of the Cl- transport pathway; even the number of functional portals is uncertain, and if multiple portals do exist, their relative functional contributions are unknown. Here, we used patch-clamp recording to identify the contributions of positively charged amino acid side chains located in CFTR's cytoplasmic transmembrane extensions to portal function. Mutagenesis-mediated neutralization of several charged side chains reduced single-channel Cl- conductance. However, these same mutations differentially affected channel blockade by cytoplasmic suramin and Pt(NO2)42- anions. We considered and tested several models by which the contribution of these positively charged side chains to one or more independent or non-independent portals to the pore could affect Cl- conductance and interactions with blockers. Overall, our results suggest the existence of a single portal that is lined by several positively charged side chains that interact electrostatically with both Cl- and blocking anions. We further propose that mutations at other sites indirectly alter the function of this single portal.

Neutralization of many charged side chemical groups caused by gene sequence changes reduced movement of Cl- through a single channel. However, these gene sequence changes affected channel blockade by negatively charged atoms differently. We used many models to look at ways these positively charged chemical groups changed one or more portals and its effect on Cl- movement and interaction with blockers. Our results suggest one portal is lined by many positively charged side chemical groups that interact with both CL- and other blocking negatively charged ions. We further suggest that gene sequence changes at other sides change how well the single portal works. We compared our results with recent information on CFTR structure to understand the pathway of Cl- transport at a molecule level."

21,32328842,"Purpose: The aim of the study was to determine which diagnostic modality [Computerized Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or ultrasound (US)] is more precise in terms of sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing inguinal hernia and sub-type of inguinal hernia (direct or indirect). Results: Bubble charts depicting the size of each patient cohort and percentual range for both sensitivity and specificity showed that US was better than CT and MRI in diagnosing inguinal hernia. Bubble charts for US and CT depicted high values within the studies that reported sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing type of hernia. Conclusions: We found that US had the highest sensitivity and specificity. However, it must be taken into consideration that performance is highly dependent on the operator's level of expertise. Based on this systematic review, ultrasound may be the preferred imaging modality when physical examination is inconclusive, given that local expertise in performing US examination for hernia disease is adequate.","We aimed to find which diagnostic tool (CT, MRI, or ultrasound) is more accurate for detection and no detection in diagnosing a hernia (bulging of organs) in the groin area and sub-type (direct or indirect; based on location within the groin). Results showed that ultrasound was better than CT and MRI in accuracy for detection and no detection in diagnosing a hernia in the groin region. Results showed ultrasound and CT were very accurate for detection and no detection in diagnosing type of hernia. We found that ultrasound was the most accurate for detection and no detection. One must remember that the expertise level of the person using the diagnostic tool can determine how well the tool works. Based on this review, ultrasound may be the best option when physical exam is uncertain, given that ultrasound is done acceptably at the local level.",

Here, we developed an mRNA vaccine based on the trimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein fused to ferritin-formed nanoparticles (TF-RBD). Compared to the trimeric form of the RBD mRNA vaccine (T-RBD), TF-RBD delivered intramuscularly elicited robust and durable humoral immunity as well as a Th1-biased cellular response. After further challenge with live SARS-CoV-2, immunization with a two-shot low-dose regimen of TF-RBD provided adequate protection in hACE2-transduced mice. In addition, the mRNA template of TF-RBD was easily and quickly engineered into a variant vaccine to address SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The TF-RBD multivalent vaccine produced broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies against Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) variants. This mRNA vaccine based on the encoded self-assembled nanoparticle-based trimer RBD provides a reference for the design of mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2.","As COVID-19, a viral breathing-related disease, continues to spread rapidly worldwide and variants continue to emerge, the development and distribution of safe and effective vaccines are urgently needed. Researchers developed an mRNA vaccine (a vaccine that introduces or copies a piece of messenger RNA - genetic material - that corresponds to a virus) that is based on trimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) (part of the virus located on the spike protein which is involved in introducing a virus into host cells) and is fused to TF-RBD, tiny molecules that protect the copies called nanoparticles. The TF-RBD nanoparticles delivered humoral immunity (immunity in which molecules create antibodies against a specific antigen and involve substances found in the humors, or body fluids) as well as a cellular response (using white blood cells that are part of the body's natural immune system). Immunization with two shots of a low dose vaccine of TF-RBD provided adequate protection in mice. In addition, the mRNA template of TF-RBD vaccine was easily and quickly changed into a variant vaccine to address SARS-CoV-2 mutations.

38,29025198,"Background: Pressure ulcers, also known as pressure injuries and bed sores, are localised areas of injury to the skin or underlying tissues, or both. Dressings made from a variety of materials, including foam, are used to treat pressure ulcers. An evidence-based overview of dressings for pressure ulcers is needed to enable informed decision-making on dressing use. This review is part of a suite of Cochrane Reviews investigating the use of dressings in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Each review will focus on a particular dressing type. Objectives: To assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of foam wound dressings for healing pressure ulcers in people with an existing pressure ulcer in any care setting. Main results: We included nine trials with a total of 483 participants, all of whom were adults (59 years or older) with an existing pressure ulcer Category/Stage II or above. All trials had two arms, which compared foam dressings with other dressings for treating pressure ulcers. The certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low due to various combinations of selection, performance, attrition, detection and reporting bias, and imprecision due to small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. We had very little confidence in the estimate of effect of included studies. Where a foam dressing was compared with another foam dressing, we established that the true effect was likely to be substantially less than the study's estimated effect. We present data for four comparisons. One trial compared a silicone foam dressing with another (hydropolymer) foam dressing (38 participants), with an eight-week (short-term) follow-up. It was uncertain whether alternate types of foam dressing affected the incidence of healed pressure ulcers (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.75) or adverse events (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.25), as the certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for serious limitations in study design and very serious imprecision. Four trials with a median sample size of 20 participants (230 participants), compared foam dressings with hydrocolloid dressings for eight weeks or less (short-term). It was uncertain whether foam dressings affected the probability of healing in comparison to hydrocolloid dressings over a short follow-up period in three trials (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.34), very low-certainty evidence, downgraded for very serious study limitations and serious imprecision. It was uncertain if there was a difference in risk of adverse events between groups (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.11), very low-certainty evidence, downgraded for serious study limitations and very serious imprecision. Reduction in ulcer size, patient satisfaction/acceptability, pain and cost effectiveness data were also reported but we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. One trial (34 participants), compared foam and hydrogel dressings over an eight-week (short-term) follow-up. It was uncertain if the foam dressing affected the probability of healing (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.28), time to complete healing (MD 5.67 days 95% CI -4.03 to 15.37), adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.65) or reduction in ulcer size (MD 0.30 cm2 per day, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.75), as the certainty of the evidence was very low, downgraded for serious study limitations and very serious imprecision. The remaining three trials (181 participants) compared foam with basic wound contact dressings. Follow-up times ranged from short-term (8 weeks or less) to medium-term (8 to 24 weeks). It was uncertain whether foam dressings affected the probability of healing compared with basic wound contact dressings, in the short term (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.88) or medium term (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.72), or affected time to complete healing in the medium term (MD -35.80 days, 95% CI -56.77 to -14.83), or adverse events in the medium term (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.05). This was due to the very low-certainty evidence, downgraded for serious to very serious study limitations and imprecision. Reduction in ulcer size, patient satisfaction/acceptability, pain and cost effectiveness data were also reported but again, we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. None of the included trials reported quality of life or pressure ulcer recurrence. Authors' conclusions: It is uncertain whether foam dressings are more clinically effective, more acceptable to users, or more cost effective compared to alternative dressings in treating pressure ulcers. It was difficult to make accurate comparisons between foam dressings and other dressings due to the lack of data on reduction of wound size, complete wound healing, treatment costs, or insufficient time-frames. Quality of life and patient (or carer) acceptability/satisfaction associated with foam dressings were not systematically measured in any of the included studies.

26,34368314,"Background: As a highly contagious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is wreaking havoc around the world due to continuous spread among close contacts mainly via droplets, aerosols, contaminated hands or surfaces. Therefore, centralized isolation of close contacts and suspected patients is an important measure to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. At present, the quarantine duration in most countries is 14 d due to the fact that the incubation period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is usually identified as 1-14 d with median estimate of 4-7.5 d. Since COVID-19 patients in the incubation period are also contagious, cases with an incubation period of more than 14 d need to be evaluated. Case summary: A 70-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine of The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University on April 5 due to a cough with sputum and shortness of breath. On April 10, the patient was transferred to the Fever Clinic for further treatment due to close contact to one confirmed COVID-19 patient in the same room. During the period from April 10 to May 6, nucleic acid and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were tested 7 and 4 times, respectively, all of which were negative. On May 7, the patient developed fever with a maximum temperature of 39℃, and his respiratory difficulties had deteriorated. The results of nucleic acid and antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 were positive. On May 8, the nucleic acid and antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Heilongjiang Provincial Center for Disease Control were also positive, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period. Further epidemiological investigations and clinical observations are urgently needed to identify the optimal incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 and formulate rational and evidence-based quarantine policies for COVID-19 accordingly.","Coronavirus disease 2019, also known as COVID-19, is a highly contagious, viral, breathing-related disease that has caused world-wide distress. Continual spread of COVID-19 occurs between people in close contact with one another through coughing, sneezing, breathing, talking, and touching dirty hands or surfaces. To prevent further spread of COVID-19, a period of quarantine (isolation) is recommended for those suspected of having COVID-19 and/or those who believe they have come in contact with a COVID-19-infected person. In most countries, the recommended quarantine duration is 14 days. This is because the incubation period, or the time between exposure and the first signs of illness, of respiratory or breathing-related illnesses is normally between 4 to 7.5 days. However, potential COVID-19 patients are still contagious during the incubation period. Cases with incubation periods longer than 14 days need further evaluation by doctors. For example, a 70-year-old man was admitted to the hospital on April 5th, reporting a cough, the spitting up of saliva and mucus, and shortness of breath. On April 10th, the man was transferred to the Fever Clinic within the hospital for additional treatment as he had experienced close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. From April 10th to May 6th, the man was tested for COVID-19 several times. All tests returned negative, detecting no COVID-19. On May 7th, the man developed a severe fever, and his breathing issues become worse. The man was tested again for COVID-19 and was positive, detecting COVID-19. On May 8th, a second COVID-19 test was conducted by the Heilongjiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and was returned positive. The man was diagnosed with COVID-19, and his health status was recorded by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This example shows the importance of the COVID-19 incubation period. Additional research is needed to better define the incubation period of COVID-19 to create quarantine measures that best protect human health.",

Contrary to expectations, TD has not vanished despite the introduction of SGAs. Instead, changing prescription practices and increased off-label prescription of DRBAs have placed more patients than ever at risk of this potentially dangerous and disabling condition. This activity provides an overview of treatment strategies for TD as part of an individualized management plan, including DRBA medication adjustment and antidyskinetic treatment.","Tardive dyskinesia (TD), characterized by possibly irreversible, abnormal, uncontrolled movements related to the use of antipsychotics, negatively affects functioning and quality of life for patients. Although many believed it would be different, TD has not gone away even with the use of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), which are less likely to cause movement side effects. Instead, changes in how antipsychotics are prescribed and antipsychotics prescribed for unapproved use have increased the patients at risk of TD.

Interestingly, eating in company was associated with a lower frequency of depression (χ 2 5⋅975, P = 0⋅015). To conclude, Mediterranean dietary habits were favourably associated with cardiometabolic markers and management of some comorbidities in this group of people with non-dialysis dependent CKD.","Keeping a Mediterranean lifestyle may be a useful primary and secondary prevention plan for chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aims to explore adherence (commitment) to a Mediterranean lifestyle and its association with blood pressure, cholesterol, and other heart related measures, as well as its impact on kidney function. This study includes 99 people aged 73.2 years (plus or minus 10.5 years) with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis, a process that uses a machine to filter blood. Adherence is assessed (measured) using the Mediterranean Lifestyle (MEDLIFE) index, that includes questions on food consumption, dietary habits, physical activity, rest, and social interactions. Tests on total cholesterol, LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, blood sugar levels in the last 2-3 months and at any random time, and kidney function are collected from medical records and blood pressure measured at the start of the study. Overall, adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle is moderate to low with an average MEDLIFE index score of 11⋅33 ± 3⋅31. Adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle is associated with employment. Mediterranean dietary habits are associated with certain heart-related measures, such as how limiting sugar in beverages is associated with lower diastolic blood pressure (bottom number of blood pressure readings), eating in moderation with favorable blood sugar levels tested at random, having more than two snack foods per week with blood sugar tests, and LDL-cholesterol. Interestingly, eating with others is associated with a lower frequency of depression. In conclusion, Mediterranean dietary habits are positively linked with heart-related measures and care of other health problems in this group of people with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease.",
13,18612186,"In the treatment of arrhythmia, beta-blockers are mainly used to regulate the heart rate. However, beta-blockers are also known as drugs with an antiarrhythmic effect due to the suppression of sympathetic activity. We evaluated the antiarrhythmic effects of a highly selective beta(1)-blocker, bisoprolol, in patients with diurnal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P-AF). A total of 136 patients with symptomatic diurnal P-AF were enrolled. Patients were divided into a diurnal-specific P-AF group and a diurnal & nocturnal P-AF group, as well as into a bisoprolol single use group and a combined use group with an antiarrhythmic drug. The effects of bisoprolol were evaluated in 3 categories: subjective symptom improvement, quality of life (QOL) improvement, and elimination of P-AF episode in Holter electrocardiograms (ECGs). For patients with effective treatment, a long-term effect up to 24 months was evaluated. Five patients (3.7%) discontinued bisoprolol due to side effects. Following administration of bisoprolol, 109 patients (80%) experienced subjective symptom improvement, 103 patients (76%) experienced QOL improvement, and elimination of P-AF episodes in ECGs was observed in 84 patients (62%). The elimination rate of P-AF episodes in ECGs was higher in the diurnal P-AF group than in the diurnal & nocturnal P-AF group (P=0.042). There was no significant difference between the bisoprolol single use group and the combined use group. A long-term suppressive effect by bisoprolol was observed in 70 of 83 patients (84%). The results demonstrate that bisoprolol has an antiarrhythmic effect against sympathetic diurnal P-AF, improving subjective symptoms and QOL and eliminating P-AF episodes in ECGs.","To treat irregular heart beats, beta-blockers (drugs that reduce blood pressure) are used to regulate heart rate. However, beta-blockers also prevent irregular heart beats due to the reduction of nerve-related, stimulating activity. We measured the irregular-heart-beat-preventing effects of a highly specific drug that reduces blood pressure, bisoprolol, in patients with daily paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P-AF), which involves sudden occurences of an irregular or rapid heart beat. 136 patients with typical daily P-AF were employed. Patients were divided into a group with daily-specific P-AF and a daily and nightly P-AF group. Patients were also divided into a group with single use of bisoprlol and a combined use group with an drug that prevents an irregular heart beat. For patients with treatment, a long-term effect up to 24 months was measured. Five patients (3.7%) stopped bisoprolol due to side effects. After using a drug that reduces blood pressure, 109 patients (80%) had personal improvement, and 103 pateints (76%) had quality-of-life improvement. Elimination of sudden occurences of an irregular heart beat was measured in 84 patients (62%). The elimination rate of episodes of P-AF was higher in the daily P-AF group than in the daily and nightly P-AF group. There was no difference between the group with single use of bisoprolol and the combined use group. The long-term effect of bisoprolol was seen in 70 of 83 patients (84%). Bisoprolol helps prevent an irregular heart beat against nerve-related, sudden episodes of an irregular heart beat, improving personal symptoms and eliminating episodes.","In the treatment of arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat), beta-blockers (medications that reduce blood pressure) are mainly used to regulate the heart rate. However, beta-blockers are also known as drugs with an antiarrhythmic effect (drugs that slow down the electrical impulses of the heart) due to the suppression of sympathetic activity (the part of the nervous system that increases heart rate, blood pressure, and other heart functions). Researchers evaluated how electrical impulses of the heart are slowed down when using a beta-blocker called bisoprolol in patients with diurnal (during the day) paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rate that returns to normal within 7 days on its own or with treatment). A total of 136 patients with symptomatic daytime paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P-AF) were included in the study. Patients were divided into a daytime P-AF or a daytime and nighttime P-AF group, as well as into a group that only uses bisoproplol and a group that uses a combination of heart treatment drugs. The effects of bisoprolol are evaluated in 3 categories: symptom improvement, quality of life improvement, and elimination of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P-AF) events, which are measured using a portable device called Holter electrocardiograms (ECGs) to record heart rhythms. For patients with effective treatment, a long-term effect up to 24 months was evaluated. Five patients stopped using bisoprolol due to side effects. Following use of bisoprolol, 80% experienced symptom improvement, 76% experienced quality of life improvement, and elimination of P-AF episodes in ECGs was observed in 62%. The elimination rate of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation episodes in ECGs was higher in the daytime group than in the daytime and nighttime group. There was no significant difference between the group that only used bisoprolol and the combined use group. A long-term effect of reducing P-AF using bisoprolol was found in 84% of patients. This study shows that bisoprolol can slow down the electrical impulses of the heart in daytime paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, improve symptoms and quality of life, and eliminate paroxysmal atrial fibrillation episodes in ECGs."
52,32210915,"Background: Turner syndrome (TS) is a sex chromosome aneuploidy with a variable spectrum of symptoms including short stature, ovarian failure and skeletal abnormalities. The etiology of TS is complex, and the mechanisms driving its pathogenesis remain unclear. Methods: In our study, we used the online Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray expression profiling dataset GSE46687 to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between monosomy X TS patients and normal female individuals. The relevant data on 26 subjects with TS (45,XO) and 10 subjects with the normal karyotype (46,XX) was investigated. Then, tissue-specific gene expression, functional enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were performed, and the key modules were identified. Results: In total, 25 upregulated and 60 downregulated genes were identified in the differential expression analysis. The tissue-specific gene expression analysis of the DEGs revealed that the system with the most highly enriched tissue-specific gene expression was the hematologic/immune system, followed by the skin/skeletal muscle and neurologic systems. The PPI network analysis, construction of key modules and manual screening of tissue-specific gene expression resulted in the identification of the following five genes of interest: CD99, CSF2RA, MYL9, MYLPF, and IGFBP2. CD99 and CSF2RA are involved in the hematologic/immune system, MYL9 and MYLPF are related to the circulatory system, and IGFBP2 is related to skeletal abnormalities. In addition, several genes of interest with possible roles in the pathogenesis of TS were identified as being associated with the hematologic/immune system or metabolism. Conclusion: This discovery-driven analysis may be a useful method for elucidating novel mechanisms underlying TS. However, more experiments are needed to further explore the relationships between these genes and TS in the future.","Turner syndrome (TS) is a sex chromosome aneuploidy or condition of having abnormal number of chromosomes.

We previously introduced a novel algorithm to calculate the Compensatory Reserve Index (CRI) based on the analysis of arterial waveform features obtained from photoplethysmogram recordings. In the present study, we hypothesized that the CRI would provide greater sensitivity and specificity to detect blood loss compared with traditional vital signs and other hemodynamic measures. Continuous noninvasive vital sign waveform data, including CRI, photoplethysmogram, heart rate, blood pressures, SpO2, cardiac output, and stroke volume, were analyzed from 20 subjects before, during, and after an average controlled voluntary hemorrhage of ∼1.2 L of blood. Compensatory Reserve Index decreased by 33% in a linear fashion across progressive blood volume loss, with no clinically significant alterations in vital signs. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve for the CRI was 0.90, with a sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.76. In comparison, blood pressures, heart rate, SpO2, cardiac output, and stroke volume had significantly lower receiver operating characteristic area under the curve values and specificities for detecting the same volume of blood loss. Consistent with our hypothesis, CRI detected blood loss and restoration with significantly greater specificity than did other traditional physiologic measures. Single measurement of CRI may enable more accurate triage, whereas CRI monitoring may allow for earlier detection of casualty deterioration.","Current monitoring technologies are unable to detect early changes associated with significant blood loss. A novel model to calculate the Compensatory Reserve Index (CRI) was previously introduced by the authors in a secondary study.

In the present study, the authors hypothesized that the CRI would provide greater sensitivity and specificity to detect blood loss compared to traditional methods. Vital signs were analyzed from 20 subjects before, during, and after an average controlled voluntary hemorrhage (excessive blood loss) of ∼1.2 L of blood. CRI decreased across progressive blood volume loss, with no clinically significant alterations in vital signs. Statistical analysis of CRI showed high confidence in the ability of the test to produce accurate results. In contrast, blood pressures, heart rate, SpO2, cardiac output, and stroke volume had significantly lower confidence for detection and specificity rates. CRI detected blood loss and restoration with greater specificity than did other traditional measures. Single measurement of CRI may enable more accurate assessment of health emergencies. CRI monitoring may allow for earlier detection of declining health.","Current monitoring technologies cannot detect early, counterbalancing changes associated with significant blood loss. We previously showed a new mathematical equation to calculate the counterbalancing blood flow mechanics or Compensatory Reserve Index (CRI) based on analysis of blood vessel wave patterns from blood flow recordings.

We analyzed 20 subjects before, during, and after a regular, controlled voluntary blood loss of 1.2 liters for continuous non-surgical vital sign wave data, including CRI, recordings, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, blood flow output, and blood volume. CRI decreased by 33% in a linear trend across increasing blood volume loss, with no changes in vital signs. CRI had high accuracy for detecting blood volume loss. In comparison, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels, blood flow output and blood volume had less accuracy for detecting the same amount of blood loss. Consistent with out theory, CRI detected blood loss and restoration better than other traditional body measures. Single measurement of CRI may enable better identification, while CRI monitoring may allow earlier detection of patient status trending towards death."
33,10219274,"Purpose: This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of age, age-related changes in renal function, and gender on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of orally administered gabapentin (GBP). Methods: The pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg oral dose of GBP were studied in 36 healthy subjects (18 men and 18 women) aged 20-78 years. Serial blood samples and total urine output were collected for 48 h after the dose. GBP concentrations in plasma and urine were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental methods. Results: All subjects tolerated the drug well, with only mild symptoms reported. No change in maximal GBP plasma concentration (Cmax), time at which Cmax occurred (tmax), or apparent volume of distribution (V/F) with age was noted. A significant linear decline in apparent oral clearance (CL/F), elimination-rate constant (lambda z), and renal clearance (CLR) with increasing age was observed (p < 0.005). Because total urinary recovery of unchanged drug (an estimate of F for GBP) did not change with age, the decline in CL/F and lambda z can be explained by the decline in CLR. The only pharmacokinetic parameter that was significantly different between genders was Cmax, which was approximately 25% higher for women than for men (p = 0.016), consistent with gender differences in body size. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that changes in renal function are responsible for age-related changes in GBP pharmacokinetics. Reduction of GBP dosage may be required in elderly patients with reduced renal function. The pharmacokinetics of GBP are similar in men and women.","This study is conducted to evaluate the effect of age, age-related changes in renal or kidney function, and gender on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (or drug activity) of orally (by mouth) administered gabapentin (GBP). The body's process of absorbing, distributing, using, and removing a single oral dose (by mouth) of gabapentin is studied in 36 healthy patients (18 men and 18 women) aged 20-78 years. Blood and urine samples are continuously collected for 48 hours after the dose of gabapentin. The amount of Gabapentin in plasma (or blood) and urine samples are measured, and other tests are done to understand how the body processes gabapentin. All patients are able to handle the drug well, with only mild symptoms reported. No change in the highest (peak) gabapentin amount, the time at which the highest gabapentin amount occurred, or apparent volume of distribution (the ability of various drugs to distribute through the body fluids) with age was noted. A major decline in clearance of gabapentin that is taken orally, the rate of removal from the body, and clearing it through the kidneys with increasing age is observed. The decline of oral clearance and rate of removal of gabapentin from the body can be explained by the decline in clearance by the kidneys. The only measure that is very different between genders is the highest (peak) gabapentin amount, which is approximately 25% higher for women than for men, consistent with gender differences in body size. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that changes in kidney function are responsible for age-related changes in how the body processes gabapentin. Giving a lesser dose of gabapentin may be required in elderly patients who have weaker kidney functions. How the body processes gabapentin is similar in men and women.",

51,25482141,"Objective: Obese youth clinically diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently have evidence of islet cell autoimmunity (proteins made against insulin-producing cells). We investigated the clinical and biochemical differences, and therapeutic modalities among autoantibody positive (Ab+) vs. autoantibody negative (Ab-) youth at the time of diagnosis and over time in a multi-provider clinical setting. Study design: Chart review of 145 obese youth diagnosed with T2DM from January 2003 to July 2012. Of these, 70 patients were Ab+ and 75 Ab-. The two groups were compared with respect to clinical presentation, physical characteristics, laboratory data, and therapeutic modalities at diagnosis and during follow up to assess the changes in these parameters associated with disease progression. Results: At presentation, Ab+ youth with a clinical diagnosis of T2DM were younger, had higher rates of ketosis, higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose levels, and lower insulin and c-peptide concentrations compared with the Ab- group. The Ab- group had a higher body mass index (BMI) z-score and cardiometabolic risk factors at diagnosis and such difference remained over time. Univariate analysis revealed that treatment modality had no effect on BMI in either group. Generalized estimating equations for longitudinal data analysis revealed that (i) BMI z-score and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly affected by duration of diabetes; (ii) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and ALT were affected by changes in BMI z-score; and (iii) changes in HbA1c had an effect on lipid profile and cardiometabolic risk factors regardless of antibody status. Conclusions: Irrespective of antibody status and treatment modality, youth who present with obesity and diabetes, show no improvement in obesity status over time, with the deterioration in BMI z-score affecting blood pressure (BP) and ALT, but the lipid profile being mostly impacted by HbA1c and glycemic control. Effective control of BMI and glycemia are needed to lessen the future macrovascular complications irrespective of antibody status.","Obese youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by a doctor often have islet cell autoimmunity (in which immune cells attack healthy cells).

10,24610977,"Background and aims: In previous studies, we successfully applied Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) in patients with non-specific chronic pain of the shoulder joint and lower back. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of LLLT for chronic joint pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers. Subjects and methods: Nine male and 15 female patients with chronic joint pain of the elbow, wrist, or fingers, who were treated at the rehabilitation outpatient clinic at our hospital from April, 2007 to March, 2009 were enrolled in the study. We used a 1000 mW semiconductor laser device. Each tender point and three points around it were irradiated with laser energy. Each point was irradiated twice for 20 s per treatment, giving a total of three minutes for all 4 points. Patients visited the clinic twice a week, and were evaluated after four weeks of treatment. Pain was evaluated with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Statistical analysis of the VAS scores after laser irradiation was performed with Wilcoxon's signed rank sum test, using SPSS Ver.17. Results: All VAS scores were totaled and statistically analyzed. The average VAS score before irradiation was 59.2±12.9, and 33.1±12.2 after the irradiation, showing a significant improvement in VAS score (p<0.001) after treatment. The treatment effect lasted for about one and a half days in the case of wrist pain, epicondylitis lateralis (tennis elbow), and carpal tunnel syndrome. In other pain entities, it lasted for about three to fifteen hours. No change in the range of motion (ROM) was seen in any of the 24 subjects.

51,10909610,"Islet cell antibodies (ICA) continue to serve as the basis of the principal serological test for definition of active autoimmunity of beta-cells. Its disadvantages are the need for human pancreatic tissue and difficulty in obtaining quantitative results. In the past decade biochemically-defined beta-cell toxins were described, leading to the development of sensitive and specific autoantibody assays, to predict insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). We examined the value of combined biochemically-based serological assays, such as autoantibodies to insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and ICA512 (ICA512A) to replace the traditional ICA assay. Blood samples of 114 newly diagnosed IDDM patients, aged 12 +/- 5 yrs (range 2 months-29 years) were tested for ICA (indirect immunofluorescence), IAA, GADA and ICA512A (radiobinding assay). The latter 2 assays were performed using recombinant human [35S]-labeled antigen produced by in vitro transcription/translation. We found that fewer sera scored positive for ICA and/or IAA (80.7%, 92/114) than for 1 or more of IAA, GAD, or ICA512 (88.6%, 101/114). We conclude that combined testing for IAA, GAD and ICA512 can replace the traditional ICA/IAA test to predict IDDM and is helpful in the differential diagnosis of insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetes.","The main blood test to determine active attack of the insulin-producing beta-cells by the body is based on islet cell antibodies (ICA; proteins made against insulin-producing cells).

We tested blood samples of 114 newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients, aged 12 plus or minus 5 years (ranging from 2 months to 29 year) for ICA, IAA, GADA, and ICA512A. We found that more blood samples scored positive (detected the presence of the disease) for 1 or more of IAA, GAD, or ICA512 than for ICA and/or IAA. We conclude that testing for IAA, GAD and ICA512 together can replace the traditional ICA/IAA test to predict type 1 diabetes and is helpful to doctors in telling the different between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",
7,25296661,"Background: Diagnosing group A streptococcus (Strep A) throat infection by clinical examination is difficult, and misdiagnosis may lead to inappropriate antibiotic use. Most patients with sore throat seek symptom relief rather than antibiotics, therefore, therapies that relieve symptoms should be recommended to patients. We report two clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenge in patients with and without streptococcal sore throat. Methods: The studies enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe throat symptoms (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing and swollen throat) and a diagnosis of pharyngitis. The practitioner assessed the likelihood of Strep A infection based on historical and clinical findings. Patients were randomised to flurbiprofen 8.75 mg or placebo lozenges under double-blind conditions and reported the three throat symptoms at baseline and at regular intervals over 24 h. Results: A total of 402 patients received study medication (n = 203 flurbiprofen, n = 199 placebo). Throat culture identified Strep A in 10.0% of patients and group C streptococcus (Strep C) in a further 14.0%. The practitioners' assessments correctly diagnosed Strep A in 11/40 cases (sensitivity 27.5%, and specificity 79.7%). A single flurbiprofen lozenge provided significantly greater relief than placebo for all three throat symptoms, lasting 3-4 h for patients with and without Strep A/C. Multiple doses of flurbiprofen lozenges over 24 h also led to symptom relief, although not statistically significant in the Strep A/C group. There were no serious adverse events. Conclusions: The results highlight the challenge of identifying Strep A based on clinical features. With the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, non-antibiotic treatments should be considered. As demonstrated here, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges are an effective therapeutic option, providing immediate and long-lasting symptom relief in patients with and without Strep A/C infection.","Diagnosing group A strep throat (Strep A) by a physical exam is difficult, and diagnosing it incorrectly may lead to use of the wrong antibiotic. Doctors should suggest treatments that improve symptoms to people with sore throat because most do not want antibiotics. We looked at two studies on how well flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenge works and how safe it is in people with and without strep throat. We studied adults with moderate-to-severe throat symptoms (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing and swollen throat) and a diagnosis of strep throat. The doctor determined how likely it was that people have Strep A infection based on the history of the patient and a physical exam. We gave people either flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges or sugar lozenges and they reported three throat symptoms (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing and swollen throat) at the beginning of the study and regularly over 24 h. We gave 203 people flurbiprofen 8.75 mg and 199 people sugar lozenges, for a total of 402 people. A throat swab to find, grow, and test bacteria in the throat found Strep A in 10% of people and group C strep (Strep C) in 14% of people. The doctors correctly diagnosed Strep A in 11 of 40 cases. People had greater symptom relief with one flurbiprofen lozenge than one sugar lozenge for three throat symptoms (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing and swollen throat), lasting 3-4 h for people with and without Strep A or C. People with Strep A or C may have some symptom relief with more than one flurbiprofen lozenge over 24 h. There were no serious side effects. We conclude that the studies emphasize the difficulty of identifying Strep A based on signs and symptoms. With the growing problem of bacteria able to defeat the antibiotics designed to kill them, treatments that are not antibiotics should be considered. As shown here, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges work, giving immediate and long-lasting symptom relief in people with and without Strep A or C infection.","Identifying bacterial group A strep (Strep A) throat infection by examination is difficult. Misidentifying may lead to innappropriate antibacterial antibiotic use. Most with sore throat seek symptom relief rather than antibacterial antibiotics, so therapies that relieve symptoms should be promoted. We show two trials on the success and safety of anti-inflammatory fluriboprofen lozenges in those with and without strep throat. The studies enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe throat symptoms (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing and swollen throat) and with inflammation of the pharynx (specific throat area). The practitioner measured risk of Strep A bacterial infection by historical and medical findings. Patients were randomised to anti-inflammatory flurbiprofen or inactive treatment. They also reported three throat symptoms at start and regular intervals over 24 hours. 402 patients received treatment (203 with antinflammatory flurbiprofen and 199 with inactive treatment). Testing isolated throat cells identified bacterial Strep A in 10% of patients and group C streptococcus (Strep C) in another 14%. The practitioners correctly identified Strep A in 11/40 cases. A single anti-inflammatory flurbiprofen lozenge gave more relief than the inactive treatment for all three throat symptoms and for 3-4 hours. Multiple doses of flurbiprofen over 24 hours led to mild, negligible symptom relief. There were no serious side effects. It is difficult identifying bacterial Strep A by clinical features. With growing antibiotic resistance, non-antibiotic treatments should be considered. As seen here, anti-inflammatory flurbiprofen lozenges are effective treatment, giving immediate and long-lasting symptom relief."

34,22421952,"Background: Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (PEG-EPO) is indicated for the treatment of anaemia due to chronic kidney disease. Its long half-life allows it to be administered once per month in maintenance therapy. Objective: To evaluate the use, effectiveness and cost of PEG-EPO in a group of pre-dialysis chronic renal failure patients. Method: Retrospective observational study in pre-dialysis patients who began treatment with PEG-EPO between May 2008 and February 2009. The following data were gathered: age, sex, haemoglobin levels (Hb) and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dose and frequency. The follow-up period was 12 months. Results: We included 198 patients. Mean Hb upon starting PEG-EPO in patients who had received no prior treatment was 10.8g/l, and 11.6g/l at 90 days (P<.0001). In patients previously treated with ESA, mean Hb before starting PEG-EPO treatment was 11.2g/l, and 11.4g/l at 12 months (P=.846). Hb values were higher than 12g/l (P<.0001) after 12 months of treatment in 25% of patients; of these, 45% had values above 13g/l. We observed doses 39% lower than those indicated on the drug leaflet, resulting in a reduction in the originally expected theoretical costs. Conclusions: The doses of PEG-EPO administered to patients with a prior history of ESA treatment were lower than those indicated by the drug leaflet, and Hb remained stable after 12 months of treatment. A large portion of the patients had levels above the 13g/l threshold.","Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (PEG-EPO) is an injection that is often used to treat anemia (low red blood cells) due to chronic kidney disease. It stays in the body long enough to be given once per month. The objective of this study is to evaluate the use, effectiveness and cost of PEG-EPO in a group of chronic kidney failure patients who have not started dialysis, a process of using a machine to clean the blood of a person whose kidneys are not working normally. This study uses data from pre-dialysis patients who started treatment with Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (PEG-EPO) between May 2008 and February 2009. The following data are gathered: age, sex, hemoglobin levels (count of proteins that carry oxygen in the blood) and the dose and frequency of medication called erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) to help make red blood cells. The follow-up period is 12 months. The study included 198 patients. The average hemoglobin levels when patients start PEG-EPO who had received no prior treatment is 10.8 grams/liter, and is 11.6 grams/liter at 90 days. In patients who are previously treated with ESA medications to help make red blood cells, the average hemoglobin levels before starting PEG-EPO treatment is 11.2 grams/liter, and is 11.4 grams/liter at 12 months. Hemoglobin levels are higher than 12 grams/liter after 12 months of treatment in 25% of patients. Among these patients, 45% have levels above 13 grams/liter. Researchers observed doses 39% lower than those listed on the drug leaflet or description, resulting in less cost than originally expected. In conclusion, the doses of PEG-EPO given to patients with a prior history of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) treatment are lower than those noted in the drug leaflet. Also, hemoglobin levels remained stable after 12 months of treatment. A large portion of the patients had levels above the 13 grams/liter threshold.",
36,34477130,"Background: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL) versus standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy in patients with renal and upper ureteric stones. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The eligible RCTs were selected from the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The reference lists of retrieved studies were also investigated. Results: Our analysis included 10 RCTs with 1612 patients. Pooled data from 10 RCTs revealed the following: stone-free rate (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.12,1.88], P = .004), operative time (mean difference [MD] = 4.10, 95% CI [-1.37,9.56], P = .14), length of hospital stay (MD = -15.31, 95% CI [-29.43,-1.19], P = .03), hemoglobin decrease (MD = -0.86, 95% CI [-1.19,-0.53], P < .00001), postoperative fever (MD = 0.83, 95% CI [0.49,1.40], P = .49), and urine leakage (MD = 0.59, 95% CI [0.25,1.37], P = .22). Besides, we performed sub-group analysis based on vacuum suction effect and multiple kidney stones. For vacuum suction effect, it revealed the following: stone-free rate in vacuum suction group (P = .007) and in non-vacuum suction group (P = .19). Operative time in vacuum suction group (P = .89), non-vacuum suction group (P = .16). Postoperative fever in vacuum suction group (P = .49), non-vacuum suction group (P = .85). Conclusion: This pooled analysis indicated that MPCNL was a safe and effective method for treating renal stones compared with standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Besides, the vacuum suction effect in MPCNL played a more important role. When it comes to multiple or staghorn stones, the longer operative time in MPCNL could not be ignored.","This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL), when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a scope to remove kidney stones versus the standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy that uses a larger instrument to remove stones. Researchers analyze data from published clinical trials. Eligible trials are from the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The articles of these clinical trials included a list of other existing studies that are also reviewed. The analysis includes 10 trials with 1612 patients. The data gathered and analyzed from the 10 trials found revealed information on the following: stone-free rate, how long the procedures take, length of hospital stay, red blood cells decrease, fever after the procedure, and urine leakage. Researchers also analyzed additional data on the effects of vacuum suction (vacuuming up stone fragments) and multiple kidney stones. For vacuum suction effect, it reveals a difference in the stone-free rate in the vacuum suction group but not in the non-vacuum suction group. There is no significant difference in how long the procedure took between the vacuum suction group and the non-vacuum suction group. There is no significant difference in having a fever after the procedure between the vacuum suction group and the non-vacuum suction group. In conclusion, this analysis suggests that minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL) is a safe and effective method for treating kidney stones compared with the standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy process. Additionally, the vacuum suction effect in MPCNL played a more important role. When it comes to multiple or staghorn (larger) stones, the longer procedure time in MPCNL could not be ignored.",
28,34531331,"Senescent cells, which arise due to damage-associated signals, are apoptosis-resistant and can express a pro-inflammatory, tissue-destructive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We recently reported that a component of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) surface protein, S1, can amplify the SASP of senescent cultured human cells and that a related mouse β-coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), increases SASP factors and senescent cell burden in infected mice. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 induces senescence in human non-senescent cells and exacerbates the SASP in human senescent cells through Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3). TLR-3, which senses viral RNA, was increased in human senescent compared to non-senescent cells. Notably, genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting TLR-3 prevented senescence induction and SASP amplification by SARS-CoV-2 or Spike pseudotyped virus. While an artificial TLR-3 agonist alone was not sufficient to induce senescence, it amplified the SASP in senescent human cells. Consistent with these findings, lung p16INK4a+ senescent cell burden was higher in patients who died from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection than other causes. Our results suggest that induction of cellular senescence and SASP amplification through TLR-3 contribute to SARS-CoV-2 morbidity, indicating that clinical trials of senolytics and/or SASP/TLR-3 inhibitors for alleviating acute and long-term SARS-CoV-2 sequelae are warranted.","Senescent cells are cells that are no longer able to divide but are still active. Senescent cells become active when damage-associated signals are triggered. These cells are resistant to cell death. They can also release tissue damaging, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This means these cells release high levels of inflammatory (infection-fighting) cells. The authors of this report recently reported that a protein associated with the coronavirus or virus for COVID-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) can increase SASP within cultured (grown within a lab) human cells. Additionally, the authors reported that a specific strain of mouse coronavirus increases SASP and the amount of senescent cells within sickened mice. In this study, the authors demonstrate that COVID-19 causes cells to become senescent and overactive SASP in human senescent cells through a specific immune system receptor known as Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3). Immune receptors are structures that bind to the surface of a cell and causes a response. TLR-3 can detect virus RNA or genetic material. TLR-3 was increased in human senescent cells compared to those not in a state of senescence. The blocking of TLR-3 prevented senescence causation and SASP amplification from occurring following COVID-19 or Spike pseudo-typed virus (a virus manipulated to not replicate). An artificial TLR-3 agonist, a substance that induces a specific response similar to the original, was not strong enough to induce or cause senescence. However, it did amplify SASP in senescent human cells. Consistent with these findings, the amount of senescent cells within lungs was increased in patients who died from acute COVID-19 infection when compared to patients who passed away for other reasons. These results suggest increased cell senescence and SASP through TLR-3 contributed to COVID-19 death. This indicates that clinical trials of senolytics (drugs that only kill senescent cells) or SASP/TLR-3 inhibitors or blockers are needed. These trials may help reduce short- and long-term effects of COVID-19.",
40,21286870,"Although compression therapy was initially described over 2,000 years ago (Felty and Rooke Semin Vasc Surg Mar 18:36-40, 1), several patients with edema do not receive appropriate compression therapy. Instead, most patients with edema are treated primarily with diuretics. Compression therapy is the cornerstone of treatment of venous edema and lymphatic disorders. Compression therapy decreases the foot and leg volume and reduces venous reflux and venous hypertension. Compression can be achieved by multiple different modalities, such as inelastic bandages; multilayered wraps; short, medium, and long stretch bandages; graduated compression stockings; and pneumatic compression devices. The major criticism of compression therapy is poor patient compliance. Compliance can be improved by selecting appropriate compression therapy tailored to the needs of the individual patient and by providing adequate patient education.","Although compression therapy was first described over 2,000 years ago, many patients with edema do not receive appropriate compression therapy. Edema is swelling within the body due to excess fluid build up. Instead, most patients with swelling are treated primarily with diuretics (drugs that promote urination). Compression therapy is a vital treatment for venous edema (vein swelling) and lymphatic disorders (disorders of the body's drainage system). Compression therapy decreases the foot and leg volume. Compression therapy also reduces venous reflux and venous hypertension. Venous reflux is abnormal back up of blood in the veins. Venous hypertension is abnormal blood pressure. Compression can be achieved by multiple different methods. These methods include inelastic bandages; multilayered wraps; short, medium, and long stretch bandages; graduated (pressure-varying) compression stockings; and pneumatic (inflatable) compression devices. The major criticism of compression therapy is that patients do not always comply with orders. Compliance with doctor orders can be increased by selecting the right compression therapy for the individual patient. Patients should also be provided with adequate education on the treatment.",

Methods: A total of 20,702 hypertensive adults were randomized to a double-blind treatment of daily enalapril 10 mg and folic acid 0.8 mg or enalapril 10 mg alone. Participants were followed up every 3 months. Results: Median values of folate and B12 concentrations at baseline were 8.1 ng/mL and 280.2 pmol/L, respectively. Over a median of 4.5 years, among those not receiving folic acid, participants with baseline serum B12 or serum folate above the median had a significantly lower risk of first ischemic stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.96), especially in those with MTHFR 677 CC genotype (wild-type) (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31-0.78).

However, TT homozygotes responded better with both folate and B12 levels above the median (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.75). Conclusions: The risk of first ischemic stroke was significantly higher in hypertensive patients with low levels of both folate and B12. Effect of folic acid treatment was greatest in patients with low folate and B12 with the CC genotype, and with high folate and B12 with the TT genotype.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the interaction of serumor blood folate (a specific vitamin) and vitamin B12 with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR- a gene) C677T genotypes, or inherited gene types for a protein involved in blood pressure, on the risk of first ischemic or brain-related stroke. Genotypes are variations of a gene. These variations are often referred to as TT, CC, or CT. Additionally, the study aimed to review the efficacy or success of folic acid treatment in prevention of first ischemic stroke. A total of 20,702 hypertensive (high blood pressure) adults were randomly placed into one of two treatment groups: daily enalapril (common blood pressure medication) 10 mg and folic acid 0.8 mg or enalapril 10 mg alone. Participants were followed up every 3 months. Average values of folate and B12 concentrations before treatment were 8.1 ng/mL and 280.2 pmol/L, respectively. Over an average of 4.5 years, participants not receiving folic acid with baseline (starting) serum or blood B12 or serum folate above the median (average) had a significantly lower risk of first ischemic stroke. This decreased risk was found especially in those with MTHFR 677 CC genotype (wild-type or normal). Folic acid treatment significantly reduced the risk of first ischemic stroke in participants with both folate and B12 below the median, particularly in patients with CC genotype. However, participants with TT genotype responded better with both folate and B12 levels above the median of participants. The study concluded the risk of first ischemic stroke was significantly higher in hypertensive patients with low levels of both folate and B12. Folic acid treatment helped the most in patients with low folate and B12 with the CC genotype, and with high folate and B12 with the TT genotype.","We checked the interaction of blood folate, a B-vitamin, and vitamin B12 with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C6677T genotypes, or specific DNA sequences in humans encoding the same protein.

6,25251231,"Thyroiditis is a general term that encompasses several clinical disorders characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most common is Hashimoto thyroiditis; patients typically present with a nontender goiter, hypothyroidism, and an elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody level. Treatment with levothyroxine ameliorates the hypothyroidism and may reduce goiter size. Postpartum thyroiditis (occurring within one year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion) can be short-lived or long-lasting. Release of preformed thyroid hormone into the bloodstream may result in hyperthyroidism. This may be followed by transient or permanent hypothyroidism as a result of depletion of thyroid hormone stores and destruction of thyroid hormone-producing cells. Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function. Beta blockers can treat symptoms in the initial hyperthyroid phase; in the subsequent hypothyroid phase, levothyroxine should be considered in women with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 mIU per L, or in women with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 4 to 10 mIU per L who are symptomatic or desire fertility. Subacute thyroiditis is a transient thyrotoxic state characterized by anterior neck pain, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, and low radioactive iodine uptake on thyroid scanning. Many cases of subacute thyroiditis follow an upper respiratory viral illness, which is thought to trigger an inflammatory destruction of thyroid follicles. In most cases, the thyroid gland spontaneously resumes normal thyroid hormone production after several months. Treatment with high-dose acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is directed toward relief of thyroid pain.","Thyroiditis refers to medical conditions that include thyroid inflammation. The most common type of thyroiditis is Hashimoto thyroiditis. Patients usually have a painless enlarged thyroid, underactive thyroid, and high levels of proteins made by the immune system to fight foreign substances. Taking levothyroxine, a thyroid drug, improves underactive thyroid and may decrease thyroid size. Short-lived or long-lasting thyroiditis can occur postpartum, within one year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion. Overactive thyroid can be caused by stored thyroid hormone released to the blood. Overactive thyroid may be followed by short-term or permanent underactive thyroid. Patients should be checked for changes in thyroid function. Beta blockers can improve overactive thyroid symptoms. Levothyroxine, a thyroid drug, can improve underactive thyroid symptoms in women with high blood levels of hormones that act as a messenger to the thyroid. Subacute thyroiditis is short-lived and characterized by neck pain, low blood levels of hormones that acts as a messenger to the thyroid, and low thyroid function based on a common test. Many subacute thyroiditis cases follow colds. The thyroid usually returns to normal on its own after many months. High-dose aspirin or similar over-the-counter pain relievers can be taken to relieve thyroid pain.","Thyroiditis covers multiple disorders represented by inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most common disorder is Hashimoto thyroiditis. Patients have enlarged thyroids, reduced thyroid function, and increased proteins targeting thyroid products. Levothyroxine (a thyroid hormone treatment) improves thyroid function and size. Post-birth thyroiditis is temporary or lasting thyroid dysfunction occuring within a year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion. Supplemental thyroid hormone release into the blood may cause excess thyroid function. Temporary or permanent reduced thryoid function may follow excess thyroid function due to thyroid hormone depletion and destruction of hormone-producing cells. Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function. Beta blockers (common high blood pressure medication) can treat symptoms of the initial phase of excess thyroid function. Levothyroxine should be considered for later phases in women with high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Subacute or fairly rapid thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation) is a temporary, thyroid-hormone-excess state with frontal neck pain, reduced thyroid-stimulating hormone, and low iodine sensitivity. Fairly rapid thyroiditis often follows an upper airway viral illness, thought to trigger inflammatory destruction of thyroid cells. In most cases, the thyroid gland suddenly returns to normal after several months. High-dose aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help give thyroid pain relief."
10,3068693,"The local, systemic, and referred causes of finger pain are generally recognizable by historical features and physical examination findings, although radiographs and laboratory evaluation are often required to support the diagnostic impression. Most minor traumatic causes of finger pain require only conservative management, including immobilization followed by exercise. Infectious causes of finger pain include cellulitis, tendinitis, paronychia, felon, and infectious emboli, which generally require antibiotics with or without drainage. Certain patients with finger pain resulting from infection should be referred to a hand surgeon. Vascular and ischemic causes of finger pain represent true emergencies, because tissue viability is dependent on prompt intervention. Whereas any sensory neuropathy may present with finger pain, carpal tunnel syndrome is among the most common. Systemic rheumatic disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or vasculitis, may begin with finger pain. In addition, such pain may be the first manifestation of a serious systemic illness, as in hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is an example of referred pain, presumably by way of neural mechanisms. Certain infectious, traumatic, and ischemic causes of finger pain must be diagnosed promptly to avoid significant morbidity; depending upon the cause of the symptoms, referral to a hand surgeon, rheumatologist, or neurologist may be appropriate. Symptomatic and functional improvement may also be hastened by the input of an occupational therapist.","The causes of finger pain can usually be found by learning about the duration and severity of the problem and doing a physical examination. However, x-rays and lab tests are often used to identify the cause of the pain. Most minor traumatic injuries that cause finger pain only need non-invasive (no surgery) therapy, such as resting followed by exercise. Finger pain caused by an infection (germs that build in the body causing illness) usually require medicines that fight bacteria called antibiotics. A process called drainage that removes extra fluid from a wound is sometimes used with antibiotics. Sometimes patients with finger pain from an infection will see a hand surgeon. Limited or no blood flow to or through the tissues in the finger can cause finger pain, are signs of a true emergency, and require immediate attention to prevent more damage to the tissues. Patients with nerve damage may have finger pain. Carpal tunnel syndrome (pain or tingling in the hand or arm caused by a pinched wrist nerve) is a common example of pain caused by nerve damage. Diseases that can cause your immune system to attack your joints, muscles, bones and organs (called systemic rheumatic diseases) can begin with finger pain. In addition, finger pain may be the first sign of a more serious illness, such as in hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (a rare disease with irritation around the bone and enlarged fingertips). Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (a disease causing long-lasting pain in one or more limbs) is an example of when an injury in one part to the body causes pain in a different part of the body. Certain infections, traumatic injuries, and blood flow problems that cause finger pain must be identified quickly to prevent long-term or more serious damage. In some cases, going to a hand surgeon, a rheumatologist (doctor who treats arthritis and other joint, muscle, and bone diseases), or a neurologist (brain and nerve doctor) is needed. Progress in reducing pain and improving movement in the finger may come faster with the help of an occupational therapist, people who help patients with injuries, illnesses, and disabilities build or restore their abilities to do everyday tasks in life.","Causes of finger pain are usually recognizable by past characteristics and findings from a physical checkup. However, radiographs (images created usually by x-rays) and other lab tests are usually required to support the identification. Most minor causes of finger pain need only mild treatment, like restraining the finger from moving and exercise. Causes of finger pain from bacteria include cellulitis (a bacterial skin infection), tendinitis (an irritation of the tendon), paronychia (a bacterial nail infection), felon (a bacterial fingertip infection), and emboli (a blood vessel blockage). These causes generally require antibacterials alomg with or without fluid drainage of the finger. Some patients with finger pain from bacteria should be sent to a hand surgeon. Causes of finger pain related to blood vessels represent real emergencies that depend on quick treatment. When any nerve damage leads to finger pain, a pinched nerve in the wrist is usually the most common. Full-body autoimmune diseases (diseases in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells), which may cause joint pain or irritation in the blood vessels, might start with finger pain. Also, finger pain may be the first sign of a serious full-body illness, as in hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, a rare disease with irritation around the bone and joints and enlarged fingertips. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (a disease causing long-lasting limb pain) is an example of pain felt in an area away from its source, possibly by nerve signaling issues. Some bacteria-related, injury-related, and blood vessel-related causes of finger pain must be checked quickly to avoid serious harm. Depending on the cause, help from a hand surgeon, rheumatologist (a doctor who treats musculoskeletal issues), or neurologist (a doctor who treats nerve-related issues) may be needed. Recovery may be quickened with occupational therapists that help patients perform everyday activities."
26,32473952,"Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over four million people worldwide. There are multiple reports of prolonged viral shedding in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 but the presence of viral RNA on a test does not necessarily correlate with infectivity. The duration of quarantine required after clinical recovery to definitively prevent transmission is therefore uncertain. In addition, asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission may occur, and infectivity may be highest early after onset of symptoms, meaning that contact tracing, isolation of exposed individuals and social distancing are essential public health measures to prevent further spread. This review aimed to summarise the evidence around viral shedding vs infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.","Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causing agent of COVID-19, has infected over four million people around the world. The are several reports of people infected with COVID-19 being active spreaders of the virus for extended periods of time. However, the results of COVID-19 tests do not always correlate to the duration of time a person can spread the virus. Meaning a person can test negative but may be actively giving the virus to others unknowingly. Because of this, the duration of time needed before a previously COVID-19 infected person is no longer able to infect others is not known. People without symptoms can spread the virus. COVID-19 can also be spread before people begin to show symptoms. The spread of the virus may actually occur the most right after symptoms show. This means the tracing of potential exposures, isolation of exposed people, and social distancing are needed to improve public health and reduce virus spread. The goal of this paper was summarize the scientific research around the spreading of COVID-19.",
11,18206410,"We determined the ability of self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) vectors to deliver and express the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha subunit gene (PDHA1) in primary cultures of skin fibroblasts from 3 patients with defined mutations in PHDA1 and 3 healthy subjects. Cells were transduced with scAAV vectors containing the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene at a vector:cell ratio of 200. Transgene expression was measured 72h later. The transduction efficiency of scAAV2 and scAAV6 vectors was 3- to 5-fold higher than that of the other serotypes, which were subsequently used to transduce fibroblasts with wild-type PDHA1 cDNA under the control of the chicken beta-action (CBA) promoter at a vector:cell ratio of 1000. Total PDH-specific activity and E1alpha protein expression were determined 10 days post-transduction. Both vectors increased E1alpha expression 40-60% in both control and patient cells, and increased PDH activity in two patient cell lines. We also used dichloroacetate (DCA) to maximally activate PDH through dephosphorylation of E1alpha. Exposure for 24h to 5mM DCA increased PDH activity in non-transduced control (mean 37% increase) and PDH deficient (mean 44% increase) cells. Exposure of transduced patient fibroblasts to DCA increased PDH activity up to 90% of the activity measured in untreated control cells. DCA also increased expression of E1alpha protein and, to variable extents, that of other components of the PDH complex in both non-transduced and transduced cells. These data suggest that a combined gene delivery and pharmacological approach may hold promise for the treatment of PDH deficiency.","This study focuses on the ability of self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) vectors (a gene therapy tool that introduces genetic material using a modified virus to create a normal copy of a damaged gene) to deliver the pyruvate dehydrogenase gene called PDHA1 (a gene involved in the chemical process to create energy for the body) and create proteins. Cell samples of connective tissue from 3 patients with mutations in PDHA1 and 3 healthy patients were collected for the gene therapy process. Cells are given genetic material with scAAV vectors containing a gene that creates proteins. Two types of vectors, the scAAV2 and scAAv6, were found to be the most effective way to deliver the genetic material into cells. Both vectors increase the production of gene proteins in patients with the damaged genes and in patients with healthy cells. Dichloroacetate, a drug used to treat genetic mitochondrial diseases (diseases where the miochondria cannot create enough energy for cells), is also used to activate pyruvate dehydrogenase, (an enzyme used in metabolism to create energy). The use of dichloroacetate did increase productivity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in cells with damaged genes involved in metabolism. Dichloroacetate did increase production of proteins from certain energy-related genes and activity in other parts of pyruvate dehydrogenase (a protein involved in the chemical process that creates energy for the body). This study shows that a combination of gene therapy and drugs may be a promising treatment for people with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency or shortage.",
25,34521513,"Background: Monoclonal antibody therapy (MAT) is recommended in mild to moderate Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who are at risk of progressing to severe disease. Due to limited data on its outcomes and the logistic challenges in administering the drug, MAT has not been widely used in the United States (US) despite of emergency use authorization (EUA) approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Aim: We aim to study the outcomes of MAT in patients predominantly from ethnic minority groups and the challenges we experienced in implementing the infusion therapy protocol in an inner-city safety-net-hospital in the South Bronx. Methods and results: We conducted a retrospective observational study of 49 patients who were offered MAT as per EUA protocol of FDA. Patient who met the criteria for MAT and received therapy were included in treatment group (n = 38) and the remaining (n = 11) who declined treatment were included in the control group. A majority of patients (76%) in the study group reported symptomatic improvement, the day after infusion. There was statistically significant reduction in COVID-19 related hospitalizations (7.8 vs 54.5%, P = < 0.001) mortality (0 vs 18.1%, P value = 0.008) in the treatment group. Conclusion: MAT reduced both hospitalization and mortality in this predominantly Hispanic patient population with mild to moderate COVID-19 with high risk factors for disease progression.","Monoclonal antibodies are medicines recommended in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients who are at risk of progressing to a severe stage of the disease. Monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 (a breathing-related disease) from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. Monoclonal antibodies are not widely used in the United States because there is little data on the impact of these drugs, and it is difficult to give these drugs to patients. This study aimed to assess the outcomes of monoclonal antibodies in patients who were mostly from ethnic minority groups and to study the challenges in providing the treatment in an inner-city hospital in the South Bronx. Researchers looked at data previously collected from 49 patients who were offered monoclonal antibody medicines. The 38 patients who received the monoclonal antibody therapy were put in the treatment group. Eleven people did not want to receive the medicines, so they were made the comparison group. A majority of patients (76%) reported improvement in their symptoms the day after receiving the medicine. There was a big reduction in hospital stays due to COVID-19 and death in the group that received monoclonal antibody medicines. Monoclonal antibody medicines reduced both hospital stays and deaths in this predominantly Hispanic group of patients with mild or moderate COVID-19.",
53,21388440,"Aims: Individuals with Type 1 diabetes mellitus are susceptible to hypoglycaemia during and after continuous moderate-intensity exercise, but hyperglycaemia during intermittent high-intensity exercise. The combination of both forms of exercise may have a moderating effect on glycaemia in recovery. The aims of this study were to compare the physiological responses and associated glycaemic changes to continuous moderate-intensity exercise vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise + intermittent high-intensity exercise in athletes with Type 1 diabetes. Methods: Interstitial glucose levels were measured in a blinded fashion in 11 trained athletes with Type 1 diabetes during two sedentary days and during 2 days in which 45 min of afternoon continuous moderate-intensity exercise occurred either with or without intermittent high-intensity exercise. The total amount of work performed and the duration of exercise was identical between sessions. Results: During exercise, heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, oxygen utilization, ventilation and blood lactate levels were higher during continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise (all P < 0.05). Despite these marked cardiorespiratory differences between trials, there was no difference in the reduction of interstitial glucose or plasma glucose levels between the exercise trials. Nocturnal glucose levels were higher in continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise and in sedentary vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise (P < 0.05). Compared with continuous moderate-intensity exercise alone, continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise was associated with less post-exercise hypoglycaemia (5.2 vs. 1.5% of the time spent with glucose < 4.0 mmol/l) and more post-exercise hyperglycaemia (33.8 vs. 20.4% of time > 11.0 mmol/l). Conclusions: Although the decreases in glucose level during continuous moderate-intensity exercise and continuous moderate-intensity + intermittent high-intensity exercise are similar, the latter form of exercise protects against nocturnal hypoglycaemia in athletes with Type 1 diabetes.","People with Type 1 diabetes are vulnerable to developing low blood sugar, also called hypoglycemia, during and after continuous moderate-level exercise, but they are also at risk of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) during periodic high-intensity exercise.

51,7783363,"Islet cell antibodies (ICA; proteins made against insulin-producing cells) are a marker of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). ICA are detected in 60-80% of the patients with IDDM at the onset of the disease. The presence of ICA in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) indicates that the patients are likely to develop IDDM. However, as ICA are measured by the indirect immunofluorescent method, the reliability of the ICA assay is not high in some institutes. Use of the pancreas tissue having high antigenicity is recommended as one solution for a reliable assay. Standardization of the ICA assay is under way with the use of an ICA positive standard sera as 80 JDF units. Anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) antibody assays using a radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have recently been developed. The significance of anti-GAD antibodies is comparable to that of ICA. Since the anti-GAD assay is reproducible and easy to perform, it should be used widely in parallel with the ICA assay.","Islet cell antibodies (ICA) are an indicator of type 1 diabetes. ICA are found in 60-80% of patients with type 1 diabetes when symptoms first appear. Type 2 diabetics with ICA are likely to develop type 1 diabetes.

24,16733942,"A drug interaction refers to an event in which the usual pharmacological effect of a drug is modified by other factors, most frequently additional drugs. When two drugs are administered simultaneously, or within a short time of each other, an interaction can occur that may increase or decrease the intended magnitude or duration of the effect of one or both drugs. Drugs may interact on a pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic basis. Pharmacodynamic interactions arise when the alteration of the effects occurs at the site of action. This is a wide field where not only interactions between different drugs are considered but also drug and metabolites (midazolam/alpha-hydroxy-midazolam), enantiomers (ketamine), as well as phenomena such as tolerance (nordiazepam) and sensitization (diazepam). Pharmacodynamic interactions can result in antagonism or synergism and can originate at a receptor level (antagonism, partial agonism, down-regulation, up-regulation), at an intraneuronal level (transduction, uptake), or at an interneuronal level (physiological pathways). Alternatively, psychotropic drug interactions assessed through quantitative pharmaco-EEG can be viewed according to the broad underlying objective of the study: safety-oriented (ketoprofen/theophylline, lorazepam/diphenhydramine, granisetron/haloperidol), strictly pharmacologically-oriented (benzodiazepine receptors), or broadly neuro-physiologically-oriented (diazepam/buspirone). Methodological issues are stressed, particularly drug plasma concentrations, dose-response relationships and time-course of effects (fluoxetine/buspirone), and unsolved questions are addressed (yohimbine/caffeine, hydroxizyne/alcohol).","A drug interaction is when other things change the usual effects of a drug, most often other drugs. When two drugs are taken at the same time, or within a short time of each other, an interaction can happen that may change the size or length of the effect of one or both drugs. Drugs may interact based on what the drugs do to each other (pharmaceutical), what the body does to the drugs (pharmacokinetic), and what the drugs do to the body (pharmacodynamic). Pharmacodynamic interactions occur when the change in effect happens at the site the drug works at in the body. Phamacodynamics is a wide field. Pharmacodynamic interactions can cause drugs to work together or against each other and can happen at different levels of the body. Drugs that affect the mind, emotions, and behavior measured through a well known tool for finding and characterizing drug effects on the central nervous system (quantitative pharmaco-EEG) can be used based on the aim of the study: safety (ketoprofen/theophylline, lorazepam/diphenhydramine, granisetron/haloperidol), drug properties (benzodiazepine receptors), or brain function (diazepam/buspirone).

A total of 67 patients with mRCC who received first-line molecular targeted therapy were included in this study. Sixty patients were evaluable by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. Patients underwent the first evaluation at 8-12 weeks after the start of the therapy. Twenty patients had TS ≧30%, 32 from 30% to -20%, and 8 ≦-20%. The median overall survival periods of patients who achieved TS ≧30%, from 30% to -20%, and ≦-20% at first evaluation were 41.0, 35.0, and 11.5 months, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that TS of≧0%, in addition to negative C-reactive protein and the absence of bone metastasis were good predictors of overall survival. The patients who achieved 0% or more at the initial evaluation had longer survival than those who had no tumor reduction (40.0 months vs 12.0 months, p<0. 001).

49,33714971,"BACKGROUND In lymphedema, an imbalance in the formation and absorption of lymph causes accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitium of the most gravity-dependent parts of the body. Diagnosis is usually made based on patient medical history and a physical examination showing a typical appearance of the affected body part. Differential diagnosis is confirmed by imaging. CASE REPORT Primary lymphedema is inherited in through an autosomal dominant pattern. Congestive cardiac failure and non-filarial infections predispose patients to the secondary form of lymphedema, elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (ENV). We present the case of a 65-year-old man with lymphedema praecox complicated by congestive cardiac failure. The patient was experiencing worsening left leg swelling and had a prior history of unilateral leg swelling at puberty. The condition was inherited through an autosomal dominant pattern, as his father, elder brother, and nephew were diagnosed with the same disease. The left leg showed non-pitting edema with indurated, woody skin and lichenification. The right leg had mild pitting edema. There were numerous verrucous folds and cobblestone-like nodules, and plaques and a painless ulcer on the left leg. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide. He was treated with compression stockings and inelastic multi-layer bandaging and was administered limb decongestive treatment. After 1 week of therapy, his swelling had somewhat improved. CONCLUSIONS Various conditions can cause ENV and it can superimpose on any form of hereditary lymphedema. The most effective strategy for this condition seems to be a thorough workup of the underlying cause of the ENV and early intervention.","In lymphedema, an imbalance of a fluid called lymph causes a build up of protein-rich fluid, usually in the arms and legs. Diagnosis is usually made based on patient medical history and a physical examination of the affected body part. The diagnosis may be confirmed by imaging, such as x-rays or another scan. Primary lymphedema, also called hereditary lymphedema, is inherited (passed down from parent to child) through genes. Congestive heart failure (inefficient heart pumping) and infections from soil particles make it easier for patients to develop the secondary form of lymphedema, elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (ENV). ENV is a rare chronic condition caused by ongoing infections with bacteria and causes a part of the body, usually the lower part of the body, to be extremely enlarged. Researchers describe the case of a 65-year-old man with lymphedema complicated by congestive heart failure. The patient was experiencing worsening left leg swelling and had a prior history of leg swelling at puberty (when a child's body changes to become an adult) due to disease. The condition was inherited, as his father, elder brother, and nephew were diagnosed with the same disease. The left leg showed non-pitting edema (there was no indentation when the area of swelling is pressed) with woody skin due to scaring that was also thick and leathery. The right leg had mild pitting edema. There were numerous folds and cobblestone-like lumps, raised red patches of the skin, and a painless ulcer (sore) on the left leg. Lab tests showed high levels of a hormone made by the heart called B-type natriuretic peptide. He was treated with compression stockings and bandaging and given decongestive treatment in the limb which includes several techniques such as draining fluid. After 1 week of therapy, his swelling had somewhat improved. In conclusion, various conditions can cause elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (ENV), and it can be an additional condition on any form of hereditary lymphedema. The most effective strategy for this condition seems to be a detailed workup of the underlying cause of the ENV and early treatment and management.",
31,32459404,"Objective: To examine the efficacy of pharmacologic treatments for tardive dyskinesia (TD). Data sources: PubMed was searched on December 12, 2017, for randomized, placebo-controlled trials examining the treatment of TD using the search terms (drug-induced dyskinesia OR tardive dyskinesia) AND (psychotic disorders OR schizophrenia). Study selection: Studies were included if they examined tardive dyskinesia treatment as the primary outcome and were randomized and placebo-controlled trials. Data extraction: The effect size (standard mean difference) of improvement (compared to placebo) stratified by medication class is reported for each of the trials included in this systematic review. A meta-analysis was conducted utilizing a fixed-effects model. Results: Vitamin E was associated with significantly greater reduction in TD symptoms compared to placebo (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.31 ± 0.08; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.46; z = 4.1; P < .001). There was significant evidence of publication bias in vitamin E studies (Egger test: P = .02). Shorter duration of treatment and lower dose of vitamin E were significantly associated with greater measured treatment benefit. Vitamin B₆ was associated with significantly greater reduction in TD symptoms compared to placebo (SMD = 1.41 ± 0.22; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.85; z = 6.4; P < .001) in 2 trials conducted by the same research group. Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors demonstrated significant benefit on tardive dyskinesia symptoms compared to placebo (SMD = 0.63 ± 0.11; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.85; z = 5.58; P < .005). Amantadine was associated with significantly greater score reduction compared to placebo (SMD = 0.46 ± 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.87; z = 2.20; P < .05). Calcium channel blockers were not associated with significantly greater score reduction compared to placebo (SMD = 0.31 ± 0.33; 95% CI, -0.34 to 0.96; z = 0.93; P = .35). Conclusions: Data from multiple trials suggests that VMAT2 inhibitors, vitamin E, vitamin B₆, and amantadine may be effective for the treatment of TD. Evidence of publication bias and a significant negative association of dose and duration of treatment with measured efficacy suggest that the benefits of vitamin E in TD may be overstated. Head-to-head trials are needed to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of pharmacologic agents for TD.","We aim to understand how well different drugs work to treat tardive dyskinesia (TD) - a movement disorder. On December 12, 2017, we searched for published scientific studies looking at the treatment of TD versus sugar pills. We included studies if they looked at treatment of TD as the main result and randomly assigned participants to groups receiving TD treatment or sugar pills. We used statistical methods to combine the results of multiple studies. Results favored vitamin E over sugar pills in TD symptom reduction. The results of the published vitamin E studies were different from results of unpublished studies. Taking vitamin E for a shorter amount of time and at a lower dose was associated with greater TD symptom reduction. Results favored vitamin B6 over sugar pills in TD symptom reduction. Results favored vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), over sugar pills in TD symptom reduction. Results favored amantadine - a dopamine promoter - over sugar pills. Results did not favor calcium channel blockers, which block transport of calcium in the body, over sugar pills. We conclude that many studies show that VMAT2 inhibitors, vitamin E, vitamin B₆, and amantadine may work to treat TD. Because results of the published vitamin E studies were different from results of unpublished studies and taking vitamin E for a shorter amount of time and at a lower dose was associated with greater TD symptom reduction, the benefits of vitamin E in TD might not be as great as studies suggest. Studies comparing TD treatments to each other are needed to compare how well they work and how cost-effective they are.",
15,31239388,"Background: The basolateral potassium channel in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), comprising the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1/Kir5.1 heterotetramer, plays a key role in mediating the effect of dietary potassium intake on the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC). The role of Kir5.1 (encoded by Kcnj16) in mediating effects of dietary potassium intake on the NCC and renal potassium excretion is unknown. Methods: We used electrophysiology, renal clearance, and immunoblotting to study Kir4.1 in the DCT and NCC in Kir5.1 knockout (Kcnj16-/- ) and wild-type (Kcnj16+/+ ) mice fed with normal, high, or low potassium diets. Results: We detected a 40-pS and 20-pS potassium channel in the basolateral membrane of the DCT in wild-type and knockout mice, respectively. Compared with wild-type, Kcnj16-/- mice fed a normal potassium diet had higher basolateral potassium conductance, a more negative DCT membrane potential, higher expression of phosphorylated NCC (pNCC) and total NCC (tNCC), and augmented thiazide-induced natriuresis. Neither high- nor low-potassium diets affected the basolateral DCT's potassium conductance and membrane potential in Kcnj16-/- mice. Although high potassium reduced and low potassium increased the expression of pNCC and tNCC in wild-type mice, these effects were absent in Kcnj16-/- mice. High potassium intake inhibited and low intake augmented thiazide-induced natriuresis in wild-type but not in Kcnj16-/- mice. Compared with wild-type, Kcnj16-/- mice with normal potassium intake had slightly lower plasma potassium but were more hyperkalemic with prolonged high potassium intake and more hypokalemic during potassium restriction. Conclusions: Kir5.1 is essential for dietary potassium's effect on NCC and for maintaining potassium homeostasis.","Potassium channels are proteins that allow rapid and careful flow of potassium ions (an atom that carries an electrical charge) across the cell boundary and generates electrical signals in cells. Two potassium channels located in cells of the kidneys called potassium channels Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 play a key role on controlling how potassium from foods affect how salt is reabsorbed. The role of Kir5.1 in how it passes on potassium from foods in the kidneys and how it releases potassium is unknown. Researchers studied Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 in different parts of the kidneys by using two different types of mice (called wild-type mice - or normal mice - and knockout mice - mice without a specific gene like the one encoding Kir5.1) fed with normal, high, or low potassium diets. When compared with the wild-type mice, the knockout mice that were fed a normal potassium diet had higher transmission of potassium, had more negative charges in some cell boundaries or membranes, had higher activation of major salt reabsorption pathways, and had an increase in the release of sodium in the urine. Neither a diet high nor low in potassium affected the potassium channel that is located at the base or sides of the cell or the negative charges in the cell membranes in the knockout mice. Although high potassium reduced activation of major salt reabsorption pathways and low potassium increased activation of major salt reabsorption pathways in wild-type mice, these effects were not found in the knockout mice. High potassium diets slowed or stopped release of sodium in the urine while low potassium diets increased the release of sodium in the urine in wild-type mice but not in knock-out mice. When compared with wild-type mice, knockout mice who had normal potassium level diets had slightly lower plasma potassium (potassium in the blood). However, knockout mice were more hyperkalemic (having a higher than normal level of potassium in the bloodstream) with a long, high potassium diet and hypokalemic (having a lower than normal level of potassium in the blood) with a restricted potassium diet. Kir5.1 is key for the effect of potassium from foods on how salt is reabsorbed and for maintaining a stable balance of potassium.",

Discussion: The use of appropriate techniques for removal of foreign bodies reduces the complications of removal and associated distress, and limits the number of cases that require surgical input.","People with objects in their ear, nose or throat that shouldn't be there usually go to general doctors. The safe and quick removal of objects that shouldn't be swallowed provides good results and reduces complications. We aimed to list common objects that shouldn't be swallowed and look at the parts of the body that may make removing them hard. We described tools and how to use them, along with times when a specialist should see the patient. Using the right ways to remove objects that shouldn't be swallowed lowers the complications of removal and possible pain, and reduces the cases that require surgery.",
55,27573827,"More than 2 million people in the United States have myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). We performed targeted, broad-spectrum metabolomics to gain insights into the biology of CFS. We studied a total of 84 subjects using these methods. Forty-five subjects (n = 22 men and 23 women) met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS by Institute of Medicine, Canadian, and Fukuda criteria. Thirty-nine subjects (n = 18 men and 21 women) were age- and sex-matched normal controls. Males with CFS were 53 (±2.8) y old (mean ± SEM; range, 21-67 y). Females were 52 (±2.5) y old (range, 20-67 y). The Karnofsky performance scores were 62 (±3.2) for males and 54 (±3.3) for females. We targeted 612 metabolites in plasma from 63 biochemical pathways by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization, and tandem mass spectrometry in a single-injection method. Patients with CFS showed abnormalities in 20 metabolic pathways. Eighty percent of the diagnostic metabolites were decreased, consistent with a hypometabolic syndrome. Pathway abnormalities included sphingolipid, phospholipid, purine, cholesterol, microbiome, pyrroline-5-carboxylate, riboflavin, branch chain amino acid, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial metabolism. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve analysis showed diagnostic accuracies of 94% [95% confidence interval (CI), 84-100%] in males using eight metabolites and 96% (95% CI, 86-100%) in females using 13 metabolites. Our data show that despite the heterogeneity of factors leading to CFS, the cellular metabolic response in patients was homogeneous, statistically robust, and chemically similar to the evolutionarily conserved persistence response to environmental stress known as dauer.","More than 2 million people in the United States have myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

6,31071734,"Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most prevalent autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of thyroid cells caused by leukocytes and antibody-mediated immune processes accompanied by hypothyroidism. In recent years, evidence has emerged pointing to various roles for vitamin D, including, proliferation and differentiation of normal and cancer cells, cardiovascular function, and immunomodulation. Vitamin D deficiency has been especially demonstrated in HT patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin D on circulating thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid hormones profile (T4, T3, and TSH) in females with HT. Forty-two women with HT disease were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial study and divided into vitamin D and placebo groups. Patients in the vitamin D and placebo groups received 50 000 IU vitamin D and placebo pearls, weekly for 3 months, respectively. The serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH) D], Ca++ion, anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (anti-TPO Ab), anti-thyroglobulin antibody (anti-Tg Ab), T4, T3, and TSH were measured at the baseline and at the end of the study using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The results of this study showed a significant reduction of anti-Tg Ab and TSH hormone in the Vitamin D group compared to the start of the study; however, there was a no significant reduction of anti-TPO Ab in the Vitamin D group compared to the placebo group (p=0.08). No significant changes were observed in the serum levels of T3 and T4 hormones. Therefore, vitamin D supplementation can be helpful for alleviation of the disease activity in HT patients; however, further well controlled, large, longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether it can be introduced in clinical practice.","Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most common type of disease caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells and results in an underactive thyroid. Recently, science has shown vitamin D can change how normal and cancer cells grow, divide, and change from one cell to another, how the heart works, and how the body's immune system changes. Too little vitamin D is seen in people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This study aimed to determine the effect of vitamin D on thyroid autoantibodies (substances that develop when a person's immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid) and thyroid hormone (T4, T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) blood levels in women. We split 42 women with HT disease into two groups and gave one group vitamin D and the other group sham treatment. We gave one group 50,000 international units of vitamin D and the other group sugar pills for 3 months. We measured blood levels of thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid hormones (T4, T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) at the beginning and end of the study using a common antibody-measuring tool. Blood levels of one antibody and thyroid-stimulating hormone were lower at the end of the study in the group taking vitamin D. The group taking vitamin D and the group taking sugar pills had similar blood levels of another antibody. Blood levels of T3 and T4 hormones did not change in either group. Therefore, taking vitamin D can help people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. However, more large studies done over time are needed to see if it can be used in patient care.",
19,32628600,"A vast advancement has been made in the treatment related to central nervous system disorders especially Parkinson's disease. The development in therapeutics and a better understanding of the targets results in upsurge of many promising therapies for Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is defined by neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation and it is reported that the presence of the neurofibrillary aggregates such as Lewy bodies is considered as the marker. Along with this, it is also characterized by the presence of motor and non-motor symptoms, as seen in Parkinsonian patients. A lot of treatment options mainly focus on prophylactic measures or the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are the point of interest which can be exploited as a new target to emphasis on Parkinson's disease. A thorough study of these targets helps in modifications of those molecules which are particularly involved in causing the neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease. A lot of drug regimens are available for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, although levodopa remains the choice of drug for controlling the symptoms, yet is accompanied with significant snags. It is always suggested to use other drug therapies concomitantly with levodopa. A number of significant causes and therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease have been identified in the last decade, here an attempt was made to highlight the most significant of them. It was also found that the treatment regimen and involvement of therapies are totally dependent on individuals and can be tailored to the needs of each individual patient.","A major advancement has been made in the treatment related to central nervous system disorders (disorders impacting the brain and spinal cord), especially Parkinson's disease. New medications and more information on how they change proteins in the body lead to new interest in many promising therapies for Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is defined by neuronal degeneration (the loss of nerve cells in the brain) and neuroinflammation (inflammatory response within the brain or spinal cord due to the immune system responding to injury or infection). The presence of the neurofibrillary aggregates (accumulation of a protein inside neurons) is considered as the trait to help diagnose. Additionally, it is also characterized by the presence of motor (movement) and non-motor (unrelated to movement such as pain and tiredness) symptoms, as seen in patients with Parkinson's disease. Many treatment options mainly focus on prevention measures or on treating the symptoms of Parkinson's. Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are the areas of interest to focus on in Parkinson's disease. A thorough study of these areas helps address changing molecules that cause the neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease. Many drugs are available for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, although levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine) is the preferred drug because it controls symptoms. However, it also has side effects. It is always suggested to use other drug therapies with levodopa. A number of major causes and therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease have been identified in the last 10 years. This text highlights the most significant of them. It is also found that structured treatment plans and therapies depend on the individual and should be made specifically for the individual patient's needs.",
42,33240489,"Extracellular histones released from injured or dying cells following trauma and other severe insults can act as potent damage-associated molecular patterns. In fact, elevated levels of histones are present in human circulation in hyperinflammatory states such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. The molecular mechanisms owing to histone-induced pathologies are at the very beginning of elucidating. However, neutralization of histones with antibodies, histone-binding or histone-degrading proteins, and heparan sulfates have shown promising therapeutic effects in pre-clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis models. Various cell types undergoing necrosis and apoptosis or activated neutrophils forming neutrophil extracellular traps have been implicated in excessive release of histones which further augments tissue injury and may culminate in multiple organ failure. At the molecular level, an uncontrolled inflammatory cascade has been considered as the major event; however, histone-activated coagulation and thrombosis represent additional pathologic events reflecting coagulopathy. Furthermore, epigenetic regulation and chemical modifications of circulating histones appear to be critically important in their biological functions as evidenced by increased cytotoxicity associated with citrullinated histone. Herein, we will briefly review the current knowledge on the role of histones in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, and discuss the future potential of anti-histone therapy for treatment of these life-threatening disorders.","Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Histones that are released from injured or dying cells and remain outside of cells can lead to damaged molecules. In fact, there are high levels of histones in humans during hyperinflammatory states, when the immune system goes into overdrive, such as acute respiratory or breathing-related distress or sepsis, which occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues. Understanding this process of changes in molecules because of histones is just starting. However, making histones ineffective with antibodies (infection-fighting proteins), histones that attach to or break down proteins, and certain carbohydrate (sugar-containing) molecules that regulate functions of blood vessel walls have shown promising treatment effects in computer models of acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. Various cell types that are dying or are activated in the neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) are likely involved in too many histones being released which can worsen tissue injury and may result in multiple organ failure. An uncontrolled inflammation response is considered as the major event; however, blood clotting or scabbing because of histones are new events showing a bleeding disorder. Also, regulating how the environment can cause changes that affect the way genes work and chemical changes of histones appear to be very important in their functions. In this paper, researchers review the current knowledge of the role of histones in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, and discuss potential anti-histone treatment of these life-threatening disorders.",
20,12097783,"Objective: Although continuing antidepressant treatment after patients have responded to medication has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of relapse, this risk is not eliminated. A number of theories have been proposed to account for this apparent loss of efficacy. A common initial approach to managing relapse is to increase the dose of antidepressant. We prospectively evaluated the likelihood of response to increasing the fluoxetine doses in patients relapsing during a long-term efficacy study of two fluoxetine dosing regimens. Method: Patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder with modified HAMD17 scores > or =18 and CGI-severity scores > or =4 were treated for 13 weeks with open-label 20 mg/day fluoxetine in a multicenter US study. Responders (n = 501) were randomized to 20 mg fluoxetine daily, placebo, or 90 mg enteric-coated fluoxetine weekly for 25 weeks of double-blind continuation treatment. If the patients relapsed during the continuation phase, they were offered a 25-week optional rescue treatment phase during which the study medication dose was increased as follows: (1) patients on placebo had treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg/day reinitiated, (2) patients on fluoxetine 20 mg/day had their dose increased to 40 mg/day, and (3) patients on a 90-mg weekly dose had their dose increased to 90 mg twice a week. The results of the rescue phase for the latter two groups who relapsed while on continuation treatment with fluoxetine are reported. Response was defined as a 50% reduction in the modified HAMD17 score since time of relapse and a CGI-severity score < or =2. Additional efficacy analyses included HAMD and CGI-severity changes from baseline to endpoint. Safety measures included assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Results: Overall, patients relapsing during the continuation treatment responded to an increased dose (57% of the 40-mg-daily group and 72% of the enteric-coated 90-mg-twice-weekly group). Mean modified HAMD17 scores decreased from a mean of approximately 20 to below 8 and were maintained for up to 6 months in the responders. Thirty-five percent of patients either did not respond or initially responded but again relapsed after augmentation of medication. Conclusions: The patients relapsing after initially responding to fluoxetine can benefit from an increase in fluoxetine dose. These results also generally support increasing dose as a first-line treatment strategy for a patient who has relapsed while taking a previously effective dose of an antidepressant. Increasing enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg once weekly to twice weekly appeared to be as well-tolerated and effective in restoring response as increasing a daily fluoxetine dose from 20 to 40 mg.","Continuing treatment with antidepressants after patients have responded to medication has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of relapse, which is when a medical condition that had previously improved starts to worsen. However, the risk of a relapse is not completely eliminated. A number of theories have been suggested to account for this possible decline in how well antidepressant medicines work. A common first approach to help a patient who is relapsing is to increase the dose of the antidepressant medicine. Researchers evaluated the chance patients will respond to an increase in the dose of fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) in patients relapsing during a long-term study of two different dosing plans of fluoxetine. Patients who have major depressive disorder are treated for 13 weeks with 20 mg/day of fluoxetine in a large US study. The 501 patients who responded to the medicine are randomly put into either the group receiving 20 mg/day of fluoxetine, the group receiving sham treatment that has the appearance of the drug but is not the real medicine, or 90 mg of fluoxetine weekly. They will be in these groups for 25 weeks during a part of the study called the continuation phase. If the patients relapse during the continuation phase, they are offered a different 25-week treatment plan called a rescue phase where the study medication dose is increased as 1) patients on placebo will restart fluoxetine at 20 mg/day, 2) patients on fluoxetine 20 mg/day will have their dose increased to 40 mg/day, and 3) patients on the 90-mg weekly dose will have their dose increased to 90-mg twice a week. The results of the rescue phase the patients in group 2 (who received 20 mg/day) and group 3 (who received the 90-mg weekly). Researchers used scoring tools that measure depression severity and seeing how much the depression scores are reduced since the time of the last relapse. Additional analyses to evaluate how well the medicine worked include changes in these scoring tools from the start of the study to the end. Safety checks include assessment of unexpected side effects, vital signs (e.g. blood pressure, temperature), and tests done in a lab. Overall, patients relapsing during the continuation treatment phase responded to an increased dose (57% of the 40-mg-daily group and 72% of the 90-mg-twice-weekly group). The average score of the tool that measure depression severity decreased and was maintained for up to 6 months in the people who responded. There are 35 patients who either did not respond or responded at first but then relapsed after increasing medication. In conclusion, patients who relapsed after first responding to fluoxetine can benefit from an increase in the dose amount of fluoxetine. These results also generally support increasing the dose as a first-line treatment plan for a patient who has relapsed while taking a previously effective dose of an antidepressant. Increasing fluoxetine 90 mg once weekly to twice weekly appears to have side effects that patients can handle and is just as effective in restoring response as when daily fluoxetine dose is increased from 20 mg to 40 mg.",
18,10521751,"Objective: The object of the study was to determine whether time of day, interval after a standard meal, and maternal body mass influence plasma glucose concentrations in women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Study design: Identical mixed meals were administered on 2 separate occasions 1 week apart to 30 women with dietarily treated gestational diabetes and pregnancies between 28 and 38 weeks' gestation. One meal was administered at 7 AM (morning meal) and the other was administered at 9 PM (evening meal), each after a fast of >/=5 hours. The order of the meals (morning first versus evening first) was assigned randomly. Sixteen of the women had a body mass index >/=27 kg/m(2) (overweight) and 14 women had a body mass index <27 kg/m(2) (lean). Venous plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and bound and free cortisol were measured hourly for 9 hours after each of the test meals. Results: When all women were considered together glucose concentrations after the morning meal were significantly greater at 1 hour, were not different at 2 hours, and were significantly lower from 3 through 9 hours postprandially than those at corresponding times after the evening meal. Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acid concentrations were higher between 5 and 9 hours after the morning meal than at the same times after the evening meal. Total and free cortisol levels were higher for the first 7 hours after the morning feeding, reflecting known diurnal variation in cortisol concentrations. Overweight patients' glucose values were significantly greater than those of lean subjects during the last 4 hours of the overnight fast. Conclusions: Among women with dietarily treated gestational diabetes the glucose concentrations were significantly higher from 3 to 9 hours after an evening meal, whereas suppression of free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate was less sustained after a morning feeding. The mechanisms underlying these differences remain to be determined but may involve diurnal influences of counterregulatory hormones. The relationships between measurements of maternal glycemia and maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes may be clarified by establishing a uniform duration of a fast and by developing meal-specific preprandial and postprandial maternal glucose targets for these patients.","The objective of this study is to determine whether time of day, the interval after a standard meal, and maternal body mass (body fat based on height and weight) influence the amount of blood sugar in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (a type of diabetes first seen during pregnancy in a woman who did not have diabetes before pregnancy). Identical mixed meals are given on 2 separate occasions 1 week apart to 30 women with gestational diabetes being treated by diet and who are pregnant. One meal is given at 7 am (morning meal) and the second meal is given at 9 pm (evening meal), each after a fast (no food) of 5 or more hours. The order of the meals (morning first versus evening first) is assigned randomly. Based on body mass index, 16 of the women are considered overweight, and 14 women are lean. Blood sugar from the vein, insulin (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood), free fatty acids (lipids from fats and oils that are a source of energy for the body), beta-hydroxybutyrate (a chemical in the body that provides energy when not enough carbohydrates or sugars have been eaten), and bound and free cortisol (a stress hormone that is bound to proteins or free in the blood) are measured hourly for 9 hours after each of the test meals. When all women are measured together, blood sugar after the morning meal is much greater at 1 hour, are not different at 2 hours, and are much lower 3 through 9 hours after the meal than measurements taken at the same times after the evening meal. The chemical beta-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acid levels are higher between 5 and 9 hours after the morning meal than at the same times after the evening meal. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol are higher for the first 7 hours after the morning meal, reflecting known daily variation in cortisol concentrations. Overweight patients' blood sugar levels are much greater than those of lean patients during the last 4 hours of the overnight fast. In conclusion, among women with gestational diabetes, the blood sugar levels are much higher from 3 to 9 hours after an evening meal, whereas slowing or stopping free fatty acid and beta-hydroxybutyrate use is less stable after a morning meal. The process causing these differences remain to be found but may involve daily influences of hormones that increase blood sugar. The relationships between measurements of blood sugar in pregnant women and maternal and perinatal (before and after birth) outcomes in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes may be cleared up by creating a standard time to fast and by developing meal-specific maternal blood sugar levels to aim to reach before and after meals for these patients.",
34,33993809,"Introduction: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) represents a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vitamin D system is altered since early CKD, and vitamin D deficiency is an established trigger of SHPT. Although untreated SHPT may degenerate into tertiary hyperparathyroidism with detrimental consequences in advanced CKD, best treatments for counteracting SHPT from stage 3 CKD are still debated. Enthusiasm on prescription of vitamin D receptor activators (VDRA) in non-dialysis renal patients, has been mitigated by the risk of low bone turnover and positive calcium-phosphate balance. Nutritional vitamin D is now suggested as first-line therapy to treat SHPT with low 25(OH)D insufficiency. However, no high-grade evidence supports the best choice between ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, and calcifediol (in its immediate or extended-release formulation). Areas covered: The review discusses available data on safety and efficacy of nutritional vitamin D, VDRA and nutritional therapy in replenishing 25(OH)D deficiency and counteracting SHPT in non-dialysis CKD patients. Expert opinion: Best treatment for low 25(OH)D and SHPT remains unknown, due to incomplete understanding of the best homeostatic, as mutable, adaptation of mineral metabolism to CKD progression. Nutritional vitamin D and nutritional therapy appear safest interventions, whenever contextualized with single-patient characteristics. VDRA should be restricted to uncontrolled SHPT by first-line therapy.","Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), which is when the parathyroid glands become hyperactive due to a disease outside the glands, can be an effect of long-lasting or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vitamin D metabolism is altered since early CKD. Vitamin D loss is a known trigger of SHPT. While untreated SHPT may worsen to uncontrolled, excess parathyroid hormone production with harmful effects in advanced CKD, best treatments for preventing this worsening are unknown. The idea of using vitamin D target site or receptor activators (VDRA) in working kidney patients, has been weakened by the risk of bone breakdown and calcium-phosphate imbalance. Nutritional vitamin D is now suggested as first-choice therapy for SHPT and low active vitamin D levels. Still, no high-quality evidence supports the best choice among different vitamin D medications. The review explores available data on the safety and success of nutritional vitamin D, VDRA, and nutritional therapy in replenishing active vitamin D shortage and treating SHPT in working kidney CKD patients. Best treatment for low active vitamin D and SHPT is unknown, due to a partial grasp of the best self-regulating mechanism of mineral metabolism to CKD progression. Nutritional vitamin D and therapy appear safest treatments, when considering single-patient characteristics. VDRA should be limited to uncontrolled SHPT by first-choice therapy.","A disease of the parathyroid (calcium-regulating) glands in the neck that is caused by another disease is called secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), with symptoms that include weak bones, kidney stones, and tiredness. SHPT represents a complication or bad effect of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The vitamin D system is altered early in CKD, and not enough vitamin D is an established trigger of SHPT. Untreated SHPT may become tertiary hyperparathyroidism (when too much of the parathyroid hormone is produced even when the original problem is corrected) with harmful consequences in advanced chronic kidney disease. However, the best treatments for acting against SHPT from stage 3 chronic kidney disease are still debated. Enthusiasm on prescription of vitamin D treatments in non-dialysis kidney patients is lessened by the risk of low bone turnover (when the bone tissue is reabsorbed and replaced by a new bone), and positive calcium-phosphate balance that makes sure systems in the body work well. Nutritional vitamin D is now suggested as first-line therapy to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism with low vitamin D blood test scores. However, no high-grade evidence supports the best choice between which vitamin D product to prescribe. Other areas covered in this review are the data available on safety and effectiveness (success) of vitamin D, vitamin D prescriptions, and nutritional therapy in restoring vitamin D to normal levels (via diet) and acting against secondary hyperparathyroidism. The expert opinion is that the best treatment for low vitamin D levels and secondary hyperparathyroidism remains unknown due to some missing key information. Nutritional vitamin D and nutritional therapy appear to be the safest interventions (treatments), when considering the individual characteristics of each patient. Prescriptions for vitamin D should be limited to only uncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism by first treatment recommended."
33,8784216,"The amino acid antiepileptic drug (AED) gabapentin (GBP) is indicated for adjunctive use in the treatment of partial seizures with or without becoming secondarily generalized in individuals older than 12 years. GBP was about as potent as phenytoin in the maximal electroshock test, but had a different profile of efficacy than standard antiepileptics in a range of animal models. Possible mechanisms of action include biochemical effects enhancing the ratio of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to glutamate, ion-channel actions (direct or indirect), and/ or enhancement of nonsynaptic GABA release. The anticonvulsant effect appears to depend on concentration of gabapentin in neurons, presumably by the L-system amino acid transporter that has been implicated in absorption from the gut. Data from studies for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval suggested a direct relationship of clinical response to dose and efficacy did not plateau at the doses used. The maximally effective dose, relationship of efficacy to blood level, and maximum tolerable dose are not yet known conclusively. Lack of significant binding to plasma proteins and lack of liver metabolism contribute to the absence of known limiting drug-drug interactions, particularly with other AEDs. Excretion intact in the urine affords dose adjustment on the basis of creatinine clearance. A half-life of approximately 7 h necessitates multiple doses daily for many individuals. The medication is well tolerated, in general. Side effects tend to be mild to moderate in intensity, most frequently affect the central nervous system, and resolve with time in many individuals. GBP has been prescribed for approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide without untoward incidence of severe systemic toxicity to date. Safety data continue to accumulate. GBP has been labeled category C on the basis of effects on rodent fetuses. Experience with use in pregnant women is limited and human teratogenic effects have not been reported. Data from ongoing monotherapy trials will help to clarify the range of clinical utility of gabapentin.","The drug gabapentin (GBP) is an addition to the regular treatment of partial seizures with or without becoming generalized seizures in the entire brain in people older than 12 years. Gabapentin has performed differently than other standard drugs that are used to prevent seizures in a number of animal experiments. Possible processes that lead the drug to have an effect include the response of increasing the development of neurotransmitters (signaling molecules in the brain) and other cell functions. The act of stopping or slowing the excessive rapid firing of neurons (brain cells) during seizures seems to depend on the concentration of gabapentin in neurons. Data from studies for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval suggest a direct relationship of medical response to the dose and success did not level-off at the doses used. The maximally effective dose (the dose at which any higher dose would not lead to improvement), the relationship of its performance to blood level, and the maximum tolerable dose (the highest dose most people can handle) are not completely known. Lack of attachment to plasma (or blood) proteins and lack of liver energy contribute to the absence of known interactions between drugs, particularly with other drugs that are used to prevent seizures. Doses can be adjusted based on the amount of the drug found in the urine. The time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma or in the body to be reduced by half is about 7 hours, requiring multiple doses daily for many people. In general, people are able to handle the medication and its side effects. Side effects tend to be mild to moderate in intensity, most frequently affect the central nervous system (spinal cord and brain), and resolve with time in many individuals. Gabapentin (GBP) is prescribed for about 70,000 people around the world without unexpected incidence of severe toxic effects so far. Safety data continues to be collected. Gabapentin has shown to have adverse effects on rodent fetuses. Experience with use in pregnant women is limited, and adverse (or bad) effects or abnormalities in human fetuses have not been reported. Data from ongoing single drug trials will help to clarify the range of the clinical use of gabapentin.",
54,24724425,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is generally quantified in serum, but spot urine samples are also used to assess hCG levels in Japan. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate whether urinary hCG can be used clinically as a substitute for serum hCG. A total of 189 samples of serum and spot urine were collected from patients, including cases of normal pregnancy (NP) -13, abortion (AB) -21, extrauterine pregnancy (EP) 25, and hydatidiform mole (MOL) -7, during medical treatment and comparisons were made concerning serum and urinary hCG levels. The histogram of relative urinary/serum hCG(U-hCG.act/S-hCG) of the samples showed a wide distribution of values, but tended to converge to a narrow distribution by creatinine correction (U-hCG.cor/S-hCG). U-hCG.cor/S-hCG of the AB, EP, and MOL groups decreased 1 day to 14 days or was no earlier than 15 days postoperatively compared to preoperatively. The alteration of serum Intact/Total tended to be similar to that of U-hCG.cor/S-hCG in clinical course. The presented case indicated that U-hCG.act/S-hCG did not correspond to serum hCG levels. Because urinary hCG levels are inconsistent depending on whether spot urine is concentrated or diluted, the levels of hCG in spot urine do not always correlate with serum levels of hCG. Therefore, the data of urinary hCG should be interpreted after creatinine correction. Overall, it is recommended to determine serum hCG levels rather than creatinine corrected urinary hCG levels, considering that the relative urinary/serum hCG was not constant postoperatively.","Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG - a pregnancy hormone) is generally measured in serum (blood). However, spot urine samples are also used to assess hCG levels in Japan. The purpose of this study was to understand if urinary hCG can be used clinically as a substitute for serum hCG. A total of 189 samples of serum and spot urine were collected from patients. Samples were collected from patients of normal pregnancy (NP) -13, abortion (AB) -21, extrauterine (outer-womb) pregnancy (EP) 25, and hydatidiform mole (MOL) -7. Sample comparisons were made concerning serum and urinary hCG levels. Hydatidiform mole leads to a cluster of fluid filled sacs from a noncancerous tumor developing in the uterus from a nonviable pregnancy. Initial analysis of sample urinary/serum hCG showed a wide distribution of values. However, the difference in distribution decreased after sample normalization. Urinary/serum hCG of the AB, EP, and MOL groups showed no difference before or after surgery. Serum measurements tended to be similar to that of urinary/serum hCG levels. The presented case indicated that urinary/serum hCG did not correspond (were not linked) to serum hCG levels. Urinary hCG levels are inconsistent depending on whether spot urine is concentrated or diluted. Because of this, hCG levels in spot urine do not always correlate with serum levels of hCG. Data of urinary hCG should be interpreted only after normalization. The authors recommended to determine serum hCG levels rather than normalized urinary hCG levels. This is because the relative urinary/serum hCG was not constant following surgery.",
9,32773454,"Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by aberrant peristalsis and insufficient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. Patients most commonly present with dysphagia to solids and liquids, regurgitation, and occasional chest pain with or without weight loss. High-resolution manometry has identified 3 subtypes of achalasia distinguished by pressurization and contraction patterns. Endoscopic findings of retained saliva with puckering of the gastroesophageal junction or esophagram findings of a dilated esophagus with bird beaking are important diagnostic clues. In this American College of Gastroenterology guideline, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation process to provide clinical guidance on how best to diagnose and treat patients with achalasia.","Achalasia describes a disorder in which your esophagus is unable to move food and liquids down into your stomach. People often have difficulty swallowing solids and liquids, spitting up undigested or partially digested food from the stomach, and occasional chest pain with or without weight loss. Measuring the strength and muscle coordination of your esophagus when you swallow led to the finding of 3 subtypes of achalasia that have different pressure and contraction patterns. A lot of saliva and puckering where the esophagus is connected to the stomach, seen using a flexible tube with a camera, or a widened esophagus and narrowing where the esophagus is connected to the stomach, that looks like a bird's beak, found by X-raying the esophagus suggest achalasia. In this guideline, we used a popular method to guide doctors on how best to diagnose and treat people with achalasia.",
54,26368010,"The objective was to determine the strength of relationship between maternal free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) concentrations and rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Consecutive records of the database of our Down screening project were assessed for free β-hCG levels and pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancies with foetal chromosomal or structural anomalies and those with underlying disease were excluded. Free β-hCG levels of < 0.5, > 0.5 and < 2.0, and ≥ 2.0 MoM were categorised as low, normal and high, respectively. Of 17,082 screened women, 13,620 were available for analysis. In the first trimester (n = 8150), low β-hCG levels significantly increased risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW) and low Apgar score with relative risk of 1.66, 1.43, 1.83 and 2.89; whereas high β-hCG group had a significant decreased risk of preterm birth and GDM with relative risk of 0.73 and 0.62. In the second trimester (n = 5470), both low and high β-hCG groups had significant increased risks of the most common adverse outcomes, i.e. spontaneous abortion, IUGR and preterm birth. In conclusion, abnormally low (< 0.5MoM) or high (> 2.0 MoM) free β-hCG levels are generally associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Nevertheless, high free β-hCG levels in the first trimester may possibly decrease risk of preterm delivery and GDM.","The objective was to determine the correlation (link) between maternal free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG - a pregnancy hormone) concentrations and rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

25,34552950,"Over 80 mAbs have been shown to block the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 S1 glycoprotein and its cellular receptor, thus neutralizing virus infectivity in vitro. Some of those mAbs demonstrate therapeutic efficacy to curtail viral burden and lung inflammation in animal models. The neutralization mechanisms of mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo are not fully understood, but optimal protection correlates with Fc effector functions. Approximately 30 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing m Abs are undergoing clinical trials in COVID-19 patients. Some were granted emergency authorization since they reduced viral load, disease severity, and hospitalization in randomized, controlled phase II clinical trials. However, mAbs are unaffordable for healthcare systems in many developing countries due to their high cost (> USD 1,500/vial), meaning that most infected people would not have access to them. Another obstacle for COVID-19 therapy with mAbs is the emergence of viral variants harboring changes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 glycoprotein. The variants of concern (VoC) exhibit enhanced transmissibility or virulence, circulate worldwide, and include those designated as alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma, and delta, first detected in the UK, South Africa, Brazil, USA, and India, respectively. Therapeutic mAbs, and antibodies in the plasma of vaccinated or convalescent individuals, fail to neutralize VoC efficiently.","Over 80 monoclonal antibody medicines have been shown to block the interaction between the coronavirus glycoprotein (a molecule that has a carbohydrate and a protein) and its cell receptor that can send signals, resulting in making the virus ineffective. The coronavirus causes COVID-1, a viral breathing-related disorder, and monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes COVID-19 from attaching to human cells. Some of those monoclonal antibodies show that they work well to reduce the effects of the virus and lung inflammation (redness and swelling in response to infection) in animal studies. The process used by monoclonal antibodies to make the virus ineffective in humans and animals is not fully understood, but the best protection is associated with the Fc effector functions, which are the part of the antibody that interacts with other cells. Approximately 30 monoclonal antibodies are currently being tested in clinical trials in COVID-19 patients. Some are granted emergency authorization (where unapproved medicines may be used) because they reduce the amount of virus in the body, lessen the seriousness of the disease, and reduce hospital stays in clinical trials. However, monoclonal antibodies are expensive for healthcare systems in many developing countries, meaning that most infected people would not have access to the medicine. Another challenge for COVID-19 medicines that use monoclonal antibodies is the new variants that change cell receptor activity for the glycoprotein. The variants of concern are more easily transmitted between people, are found worldwide, and include those designated as alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma, and delta.

42,33895124,"Over time, the knowledge on the role of histones has significantly changed. Initially, histones were only known as DNA packaging proteins but later, it was discovered that they act extracellularly as powerful antimicrobial agents and also as potentially self-detrimental agents. Indeed, histones were found to be the most abundant proteins within neutrophil extracellular traps what ultimately highlighted their microbicidal function. In addition, extracellular histones proved to be involved in triggering exacerbated inflammatory and coagulation responses, depending on the cell type affected. Consequently, several investigations were conducted towards studying the potential of histones and their derivatives as either biomarkers or therapeutic target candidates in different diseases in which inflammation and thrombosis have a key pathophysiological role, such as sepsis, thrombosis and different types of cancer. The main objective of this review is to summarize and discuss the current state of the art with regard to both beneficial and harmful roles of histones and also their possible use as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Over time, the knowledge on the role of histones has significantly changed. At first, histones were only known as DNA packaging proteins, but later it was discovered that they act outside of cells as a powerful antimicrobial, an agent that can kill microorganisms or stop their growth. They may also be self-destructive agents. Histones were found to be the most abundant proteins within neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) and highlighted their microbicidal function that kills microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Also, histones outside of cells proved to be involved in triggering worsening inflammatory (the body's natural reaction against injury and infection) and blood clotting responses, depending on the cell type affected. Because of this, several investigations were conducted to study the potential of histones and the substances they may produce as either a sign of a normal or abnormal process in the body (biomarkers or signalers of normal or abnormal processes) or possible ways to use them to fight different diseases.

51,8786012,"We studied the effect of severe reduction of beta-cell mass by 90% pancreatectomy on the immune tolerance to the endocrine pancreas. Four months after subtotal pancreatectomy all LEW.Han rats had developed mononuclear infiltration of islets and 9 of 14 rats were positive for islet-cell antibodies. Electron microscopy revealed lymphocytic invasion of endocrine tissue, lysis of beta cells and phagocytotic macrophages. None of these changes were seen 2 weeks after 90% pancreatectomy or 4 months after 10% pancreatectomy. Weekly substitution of islet antigens in the form of a homogenate of 100 islets into 90% pancreatectomized LEW.Han rats almost completely prevented the development of insulitis and autoantibodies. The dependence of insulitis on T cells was shown when 90% pancreatectomy in LEW.rnu rats (i.e., the congenic athymic nude strain), did not result in islet infiltration. The exocrine tissue remained normal in all experimental groups. During the observation period insulitis was not associated with overt diabetes but was accompanied by substantial enlargement of islets and of beta-cell mass, as shown by morphometry. Suppression of islet inflammation by injection of islet antigens abolished beta-cell regeneration, despite continuing metabolic stress in rats with 90% pancreatectomy. The findings indicate induction of islet autoimmunity in response to 90% but not to 10% pancreatectomy. We conclude that severe reduction of the islet-antigen mass allows the development of T-cell-dependent islet autoimmunity which indicates a loss of immune tolerance. In addition, the data suggest the existence of islet-antigen autoreactive immune cells in rats not genetically predisposed to autoimmune diabetes. Finally, we conclude that selective beta-cell regeneration occurs in association with insulitis.","We studied the effect of drastically reducing beta-cell (insulin-producing cell) mass by removing 90% of the pancreas on immune tolerance (state of unresponsiveness of the body's defense) to the endocrine pancreas, which controls blood sugar levels. Four months after removal of almost all of the pancreas, all rats had developed signs of long-term inflammation (infection-fighting) response of islets (clusters of cells that produce hormones) and 9 of 14 rats had islet-cell antibodies (proteins made against insulin-producing cells). Using microscopes, we saw immune white blood cells going into the part of the pancreas that produces substances (enzymes) that help with digestion, death of beta cells, and white blood cells that remove dying and dead cells. We saw none of these changes 2 weeks after removing 90% of the pancreas or 4 months after removing 10% of the pancreas. Weekly substitution of islet antigens (substances that causes the body to defend itself) in rats with 90% of the pancreas removed prevented insulitis (disease of the pancreas caused by the infiltration of immune white blood cells) and self-made proteins. Insulitis was shown to be dependent on T cells (part of the body's defense system). The tissue that produces substances (enzymes) that help with digestion did not change in any group. During the observation period, insulitis was not related to diabetes, but we saw a sizeable increase in the sizes of islets and beta-cell mass. Decreasing islet inflammation by injecting islet antigens (fragments) stopped beta-cell regrowth, even though low energy continued in rats with 90% of the pancreas removed. The results suggest removing 90% but not 10% of the pancreas causes the body to mistakenly destroy its islets. We conclude that drastically reducing the islet-antigen mass allows the body to mistakenly destroy its islets, which shows a loss of immune tolerance. Also, the results suggest islet-antigen autoreactive immune cells exist in rats not likely to develop autoimmune diabetes (diabetes from the body mistakenly destroying its own cells). Finally, we conclude that some beta-cell regrowth happens with insulitis.",
32,29371246,"Objective: This post hoc analysis of the CSPPT (China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial) assessed the individual variation in total homocysteine (tHcy)-lowering response after an average 4.5 years of 0.8 mg daily folic acid therapy in Chinese hypertensive adults and evaluated effect modification by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotypes and serum folate levels. Approach and results: This analysis included 16 413 participants from the CSPPT, who were randomly assigned to 2 double-blind treatment groups: either 10-mg enalapril+0.8-mg folic acid or 10-mg enalapril, daily and had individual measurements of serum folate and tHcy levels at baseline and exit visits and MTHFR C677T genotypes. Mean baseline tHcy levels were comparable between the 2 treatment groups (14.5±8.5 versus 14.4±8.1 μmol/L; P=0.561). After 4.5 years of treatment, mean tHcy levels were reduced to 12.7±6.1 μmol/L in the enalapril+folic acid group, but almost stayed the same in the enalapril group (14.4±7.9 μmol/L, group difference: 1.61 μmol/L; 11% reduction). More importantly, tHcy lowering varied by MTHFR genotypes and serum folate levels. Compared with CC and CT genotypes, participants with the TT genotype had a more prominent L-shaped curve between tHcy and serum folate levels and required higher folate levels (at least 15 ng/mL) to eliminate the differences in tHcy by genotypes. Conclusions: Compared with CC or CT, tHcy in the TT group manifested a heightened L-shaped curve from low to high folate levels, but this difference in tHcy by genotype was eliminated when plasma folate levels reach ≈15 ng/mL or higher. Our data raised the prospect to tailor folic acid therapy according to individual MTHFR C677T genotype and folate status.","This study represents an analysis on the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT).

This study evaluated effect modification by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotypes (a person's specific gene type for a specific protein) and serum or blood folate (derivative of folic acid) levels. The study included 16,413 participants from the CSPPT study. The participants were randomly assigned to 2 double-blind treatment groups. Double-blind indicates the study participants were not told which treatment group they were apart of. The participants received either 10-mg enalapril (common blood pressure medication) +0.8-mg folic acid or 10-mg enalapril daily. The participants had individual measurements of serum folate and tHcy levels at baseline (before study) and exit (end of study) visits and MTHFR C677T genotypes. Average baseline tHcy levels were similar between the 2 treatment groups. After 4.5 years of treatment, mean or average tHcy levels were reduced in the enalapril+folic acid group, but almost stayed the same in the enalapril group. However, tHcy lowering varied by MTHFR genotypes and serum folate levels. Participants with a specific MTHFR genotype (TT) required higher folate levels to eliminate the differences in tHcy between them and the other two genotypes (CC and CT).

22,26877139,"Loss-of-function mutations in the folliculin gene (FLCN) on chromosome 17p cause Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD), which is associated with cystic lung disease. The risk of lung collapse (pneumothorax) in BHD patients is 50-fold higher than in the general population. The cystic lung disease in BHD is distinctive because the cysts tend to be basilar, subpleural and lentiform, differentiating BHD from most other cystic lung diseases. Recently, major advances in elucidating the primary functions of the folliculin protein have been made, including roles in mTOR and AMPK signaling via the interaction of FLCN with FNIP1/2, and cell-cell adhesion via the physical interaction of FLCN with plakophilin 4 (PKP4), an armadillo-repeat containing protein that interacts with E-cadherin and is a component of the adherens junctions. In addition, in just the last three years, the pulmonary impact of FLCN deficiency has been examined for the first time. In mouse models, evidence has emerged that AMPK signaling and cell-cell adhesion are involved in alveolar enlargement. In addition, the pathologic features of human BHD cysts have been recently comprehensively characterized. The ""stretch hypothesis"" proposes that cysts in BHD arise because of fundamental defects in cell-cell adhesion, leading to repeated respiration-induced physical stretch-induced stress and, over time, expansion of alveolar spaces particularly in regions of the lung with larger changes in alveolar volume and at weaker ""anchor points"" to the pleura. This hypothesis ties together many of the new data from cellular and mouse models of BHD and from the human pathologic studies. Critical questions remain. These include whether the consequences of stretch-induced cyst formation arise through a destructive/inflammatory program or a proliferative program (or both), whether cyst initiation involves a ""second hit"" genetic event inactivating the remaining wild-type copy of FLCN (as is known to occur in BHD-associated renal cell carcinomas), and whether cyst initiation involves exclusively the epithelial compartment versus an interaction between the epithelium and mesenchyme. Ultimately, understanding the mechanisms of cystic lung disease in BHD may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, with more than 20,000 cases reported annually in the United States alone.","Loss-of-function mutations in the folliculin gene, which helps suppress tumor growth, cause Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, which is associated with cystic lung disease, a group of diseases that cause cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs. The risk of lung collapse, which is when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall, in Birt-Hogg-Dube patients is 50 times higher than in the general population. The cystic lung disease in Birt-Hogg-Dube is different from other cystic lung diseases because the cysts tend to be at the base of the lung, under the layer of tissue that wraps the lungs and is shaped like a lentil or lens. Recent advances to understand the main functions of the folliculin protein have been made. In addition, in just the last 3 years, the impact of a folliculin gene impairment on the lungs was examined for the first time. In experiments with mice, evidence emerged that another protein called AMPK that signals to other cells and cells connecting to other cells is involved when air gets trapped in the lungs. Also, how human Birt-Hogg-Dube cysts are formed and how they progress has been recently described. The ""stretch hypothesis"" proposes that cysts in Birt-Hogg-Dube form because of defects in how cells connect to one another, leading to repeated stretching of the lungs and, over time, expansion of different parts of the lung. This idea ties together many of the new data from cell and mouse studies of Birt-Hogg-Dube and from the human studies of the disease. Critical questions remain. These questions include how the stretch-induced cyst formation are formed, if the first formation of a cyst involves a second genetic change, and whether the formation of a cyst involves just the surface of the lung or an interaction between the lung surface and cells under tissues. Overall, understanding the processes of cystic lung disease in Birt-Hogg-Dube may help to understand how it leads to sudden collapse of the lung, with more than 20,000 cases a year in the United States.",

10,32100225,"This compilation presents a comprehensive review of the literature on common chronic pain conditions of the hand. It briefly presents these common conditions with their biological background, diagnosis, and common management options. It then presents and compares the latest literature available for injection techniques to treat these diagnoses and compares the available evidence. Results: Hand pain is a common condition with 9.7% prevalence in men and 21.6% in women and can cause significant morbidity and disability. It also carries a significant cost to the individuals and the healthcare system, totaling in $4 billion dollars in 2003. Injection therapy is an alternative when conservative treatment fails. Osteoarthritis is the most common chronic hand pain syndrome and affects about 16% of the population. Its mechanism is largely mechanic, and as such, there is controversy if steroid injections are of benefit. Hyaluronic acid (HA) appears to provide substantial relief of pain and may increase functionality. More studies of HA are required to make a definite judgment on its efficacy. Similarly, steroid ganglion cyst injection may confer little benefit. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a compressive neuropathy, and only temporarily relieved with injection therapy. US-guidance provides significant improvement and, while severe cases may still require surgery, can provide a valuable bridge therapy to surgery when conservative treatment fails. Similar bridging treatments and increased efficacy under US-guidance are effective for stenosing tenosynovitis (""trigger finger""), though, interestingly, inflammatory background is associated with decreased effect in this case. When the etiology of the pain is inflammatory, such as in RA, corticosteroid (CS) injections provide significant pain relief and increased functionality. They do not, however, change the course of disease (unlike DMARDs). Another such example is De-Quervain tenosynovitis that sees good benefit from CS injections, and an increased efficacy with US-guidance, and similarly are CS injections for gout. For Raynaud's phenomenon, Botox injections have encouraging results, but more studies are needed to determine safety and efficacy, as well as the possible difference in effect between primary and secondary Raynaud's. Conclusions: Chronic hand pain is a prevalent and serious condition and can cause significant morbidity and disability and interferes with independence and activities of daily living. Conservative treatment remains the first line of treatment; however, when first-line treatments fail, steroid injections can usually provide benefit. In some cases, Hyaluronic acid or Botox may also be beneficial. US-guidance is increasing in hand injection and almost ubiquitously provides safer, more effective injections. Hand surgery remains the alternative for refractory pain.","This report presents a thorough review of the literature on common chronic pain conditions of the hand.

Hand pain is a common condition occuring in 9.7% of men and 21.6% of women and can cause significant illness and disability. It is also costly to the individuals and the healthcare system, totaling in $4 billion dollars in 2003. Injection therapy (a treatment that involves inserting a needle into the skin to deliver medicine and reduce pain) is an option when other non-surgical treatments fail. Osteoarthritis (the wearing down of flexible tissue at the end of bones) is the most common chronic hand pain condition and affects about 16% of the population. There is disagreement on whether steroid injections are helpful to osteoarthritis. Injections of hyaluronic acid (a natural lubricant that can relieve pain) appear to provide significant relief of pain and may increase movement. More studies of hyaluronic acid are required before deciding how well it works. Similarly, steroid injection to reduce a ganglion cyst (a swelling or bump on the wrist joint) may have little benefit. Injection therapy provides only short-term relief for carpal tunnel syndrome (pinched nerves in the wrist). While severe cases of hand pain may still require surgery, injection therapy may be an additional treatment step before surgery. Similar treatments under US-guidance are effective for a condition called trigger finger where the finger gets locked in a bent position. When the cause of the pain is inflammation (the body's response to injury or infection often causing swelling, pain, or redness), corticosteroid or steroid injections provide significant pain relief and increased movement. Corticosteroid injections do not, however, change the course of disease. Other conditions such as gout (a type of arthritis that causes sudden pain or swelling, often in the big toe) and De-Quervain tenosynovitis (pain in the tendons in the thumb) may get some benefit from corticosteroid injections. Botox injections show encouraging results for Raynaud's phenomenon (spasms caused by slow blood flow in the fingers and other extremities), but more studies are needed to determine safety and how well the injections work. Chronic hand pain is a common and serious condition, can cause significant illness and disability, and interferes with independence and the activities of daily living. Careful, non-invasive treatment remains the first line of treatment; however, when first-line treatments fail, steroid injections can usually provide benefit. In some cases, Hyaluronic acid or Botox may also be helpful. US-guidance is expanding in hand injections and provides safer, more effective injections.

53,25555390,"Background: Although physical exercise (PE) is recommended for individuals with type 1 diabetes (DM1), participation in exercise is challenging because it increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia and the available therapeutic options to prevent it frequently result in hyperglycemia. There is no clear recommendation about the best timing for exercise. The aim of this study was to compare the risk of hypoglycemia after morning or afternoon exercise sessions up to 36 hours postworkout. Methods: This randomized crossover study enrolled subjects with DM1, older than 18 years of age, on sensor-augmented insulin pump (SAP) therapy. Participants underwent 2 moderate-intensity exercise sessions; 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon, separated by a 7 to 14 day wash-out period. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data were collected 24 hours before, during and 36 hours after each session. Results: Thirty-five subjects (mean age 30.31 ± 12.66 years) participated in the study. The rate of hypoglycemia was significantly lower following morning versus afternoon exercise sessions (5.6 vs 10.7 events per patient, incidence rate ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43-0.63; P < .0001). Most hypoglycemic events occurred 15-24 hours after the session. On days following morning exercise sessions, there were 20% more CGM readings in near-euglycemic range (70-200 mg/dL) than on days prior to morning exercise (P = .003). Conclusions: Morning exercise confers a lower risk of late-onset hypoglycemia than afternoon exercise and improves metabolic control on the subsequent day.","Although physical exercise is recommended for individuals with type 1 diabetes, participation in exercise is challenging because it increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia (very low blood sugar) and the available treatment options to prevent it often result in hyperglycemia (high blood sugar).

PI affects strength of the skin. PI is produced by prolonged pressure or friction between a hard internal and external surface. Treatment can be challenging when there is no solution with usual clinical care. The use of autologous platelet-rich plasma (APRP) gel is a possible therapeutic (medical) option for chronic pressure injuries. APRP uses injections of the patient's own platelets (blood cells) to increase healing rates. The case of a patient with chronic PI who has been treated with APRP is presented, achieving resolution (healing) of the lesion (wound).",
53,33022987,"To date, nutritional studies have focused on the total intake of dietary fiber rather than intake timing. In this study, we examined the effect of the timing of daily Helianthus tuberosus ingestion on postprandial and 24 h glucose levels, as well as on intestinal microbiota in older adults. In total, 37 healthy older adults (age = 74.9 ± 0.8 years) were recruited. The participants were randomly assigned to either a morning group (MG, n = 18) or an evening group (EG, n = 17). The MG and EG groups were instructed to take Helianthus tuberosus powder (5 g/day) just before breakfast or dinner, respectively, for 1 week after the 1-week control period. The glucose levels of all participants were monitored using a continuous glucose monitoring system throughout the 2 weeks. The intestinal microbiota was analyzed by sequencing 16S rRNA genes from feces before and after the intervention. There were no significant differences in the physical characteristics or energy intake between groups. Helianthus tuberosus intake led to decreases in tissue glucose levels throughout the day in both groups (p < 0.01, respectively). As a result of examining the fluctuations in tissue glucose levels up to 4 hours after each meal, significant decreases in the areas under the curves (AUCs) were observed for all three meals after intervention, but only in the MG (breakfast: p = 0.012, lunch: p = 0.002, dinner: p = 0.005). On the other hand, in the EG, there was a strong decrease in the AUC after dinner, but only slight decreases after breakfast and lunch (breakfast: p = 0.017, lunch: p = 0.427, dinner: p = 0.002). Moreover, the rate of change in the peak tissue glucose level at breakfast was significantly decreased in the MG compared to the EG (p = 0.027). A greater decrease was observed in the change in the blood glucose level after the ingestion of Helianthus tuberosus in the MG than in the EG. Furthermore, the relative abundance of Ruminococcus in the MG at the genus level was significantly higher at baseline than in the EG (p = 0.016) and it was also significantly lower after the intervention (p = 0.013). Our findings indicate that Helianthus tuberosus intake in the morning might have relatively stronger effects on the intestinal microbiota and suppress postprandial glucose levels to a greater extent than when taken in the evening.","To date, nutritional studies have focused on the total amount of dietary fiber consumed rather than when the fiber was consumed. In this study, researchers examine the effect of the timing of daily ingestion of Jerusalem artichoke (sunroot, Helianthus tuberosus) on blood sugar levels after meals and at 24 hours, as well as on gut bacteria in older adults. In total, 37 healthy older adults (age = 74.9 ± 0.8 years) are recruited. The participants are randomly assigned to either a morning group (18 participants) or an evening group (17 participants). The morning group is instructed to take Jerusalem artichoke powder just before breakfast, and the evening group to take it just before dinner. Each group took the powder for 1 week. The blood sugar levels of all participants are monitored using a continuous blood sugar monitoring system throughout the 2 weeks. The gut bacteria is analyzed from feces (poop) before and after participants consumed the Jerusalem artichoke. There are no significant differences in the physical characteristics or the amount of calories consumed between groups. Consuming Jerusalem artichoke leads to decreases in tissue blood sugar levels throughout the day in both groups. As a result of examining the changes in tissue blood glucose levels up to 4 hours after each meal, big decreases in the overall exposure to the Jerusalem artichoke in the body is observed for all three meals after intervention (treatment), but only in the morning group. On the other hand, in the evening group, there is a strong decrease in the overall exposure to the plant after dinner, but only slight decreases after breakfast and lunch. Additionally, the rate of change in the max tissue blood sugar level at breakfast is significantly decreased in the morning group compared to the evening group. A greater decrease is observed in the change in the blood sugar level after the ingestion of Jerusalem artichoke in the morning group than in the evening group. Furthermore, the relative abundance of a gut bacteria that can break down fiber called Ruminococcus in the morning group is much higher at the start of the study than in the evening group, and it is also much lower after the study. The findings suggest that consuming Jerusalem artichoke in the morning might have relatively stronger effects on the gut bacteria and slow post-meal blood sugar levels to a greater extent than when taken in the evening.",
33,15584938,"Purpose: The pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in paediatric patients with uncontrolled seizures was studied. Methods: Thirteen paediatric patients (mean age: 9.4 years) with uncontrolled partial seizures were included. Patients received gabapentin orally until doses were individualized to 9.6-39.8 mg/kg/day. Blood samples were obtained just prior to the dose and over 8 h after gabapentin was administered in the fasting state. The plasma concentration of gabapentin was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters for gabapentin were determined by non-compartment methods using multivariate regression analysis. Results: Data from nine patients were suitable for pharmacokinetic analysis. The C(max) from 0.9 to 5.8 microg/mL (mean: 2.6 +/- 1.7 microg/mL) and T(max) from 0.5 to 2.0 h (mean: 1.6 +/- 1.0 h). The apparent clearance (Cl/F) ranged from 0.12 to 1.12 L/h/kg (mean: 0.50 +/- 0.29 L/h/kg), and the elimination half-life from 3.2 to 12.2 h (mean: 5.5 +/- 0.8 h). Five patients experienced moderate (n = 4) to severe (n = 1) aggressive behaviour and another gained weight on gabapentin. Conclusions: Our data suggests that gabapentin pharmacokinetics can vary substantially among paediatric patients. Gabapentin was well tolerated in patients with uncontrolled partial seizures up to 6 months of therapy.","How the pediatric or child patients with uncontrolled seizures are able to handle gabapentin (a nerve-related pain medication) and the processes of absorbing, distributing, using, and removing it is studied. In this study, 13 pediatric patients (less the 21 years old) with an average age of about 9 years with uncontrolled partial seizures are included. Patients received gabapentin orally (by mouth) until doses are changed for each patient. Blood samples are obtained just before the dose and over 8 hours after gabapentin is given during fasting, when all foods have been completely digested. Blood concentrations of gabapentin is measured by blood tests. Absorption, distribution, use, and removal of gabapentin in the body is analyzed. Data from 9 patients are able to be used for analysis. The maximum concentration of the drug and the time it takes to reach maximum concentration are estimated. Five patients experience moderate (4 patients) to severe (1 patient) aggressive behavior, and another gained weight on gabapentin. In conclusion, the data in this study suggests that how the body processes gabapentin can vary a lot among pediatric patients. In this study, patients with uncontrolled partial seizures were able to handle gabapentin well up to 6 months of therapy.",
6,16127951,"The proper treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on recognition of the signs and symptoms of the disease and determination of the etiology. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease. Other common causes include thyroiditis, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenomas, and side effects of certain medications. The diagnostic workup begins with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level test. When test results are uncertain, measuring radionuclide uptake helps distinguish among possible causes. When thyroiditis is the cause, symptomatic treatment usually is sufficient because the associated hyperthyroidism is transient. Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma can be treated with radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery, but in the United States, radioactive iodine is the treatment of choice in patients without contraindications. Thyroidectomy is an option when other treatments fail or are contraindicated, or when a goiter is causing compressive symptoms. Some new therapies are under investigation. Special treatment consideration must be given to patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, as well as those with Graves' ophthalmopathy or amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Patients' desires must be considered when deciding on appropriate therapy, and dose monitoring is essential.","Successfully treating an overactive thyroid depends on identifying the signs and symptoms of the disease and determining the cause. Graves' disease, a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells, is the most common cause of an overactive thyroid. Other common causes of an overactive thyroid include thyroid inflammation, one or more glandular growths making extra thyroid hormone, and side effects of some medications. A common test that measures blood levels of hormones that acts as messengers to the thyroid is the first step in a medical exam. When results of this test are uncertain, a test to measure thyroid function can be used. When the cause is inflammation of the thyroid, treating the symptoms is enough because the overactive thyroid is short-lived. Graves' disease and when one or more growths make extra thyroid hormone can be treated with radiation therapy, drugs that block the formation of thyroid hormone, or surgery. In the United States, radiation therapy to shrink the thyroid is preferred unless there is a reason not to do so. Thyroid removal is an option when other treatments do not work or should not be used, or when an enlarged thyroid is causing pressure or squeezing. New treatments are being studied. People who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and people with thyroid eye disease or overactive thyroids caused by amiodarone, a heart medication, must be given special treatment consideration. We must factor in what patients want when deciding on treatment. Maintaining a safe and effective dose is very important.",
28,34577851,"Background and Objectives. The importance of mitochondria in inflammatory pathologies, besides providing energy, is associated with the release of mitochondrial damage products, such as mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA), which may perpetuate inflammation. In this review, we aimed to show the importance of mitochondria, as organelles that produce energy and intervene in multiple pathologies, focusing mainly in COVID-19 and using multiple molecular mechanisms that allow for the replication and maintenance of the viral genome, leading to the exacerbation and spread of the inflammatory response. The evidence suggests that mitochondria are implicated in the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which forms double-membrane vesicles and evades detection by the cell defense system. These mitochondrion-hijacking vesicles damage the integrity of the mitochondrion's membrane, releasing mt-DNA into circulation and triggering the activation of innate immunity, which may contribute to an exacerbation of the pro-inflammatory state. Conclusions. While mitochondrial dysfunction in COVID-19 continues to be studied, the use of mt-DNA as an indicator of prognosis and severity is a potential area yet to be explored.","Mitochondria (the powerhouse of a cell) play several important roles in the body. These roles include providing energy and participating in pathways of inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection). The event of mitochondria increasing inflammation is associated with the release of products from mitochondrial damage. One of these products is mitochondrial DNA which can increase inflammation within the body. This review aimed to show the importance of the mitochondria in energy production and in the intervention in the development of several diseases, mainly COVID-19 (a viral, respiratory disease). Additionally the paper aimed to show how the mitochondria organelle uses several different ways to allow the replication and maintenance of a virus. This can lead to the worsening and spread of inflammation. The reviewed scientific evidence suggested that mitochondria are involved in the replication of COVID-19. The virus forms double-walled vesicles, a small chamber outside or within a cell, that evades detection by the host's immune system. These vesicles can then damage mitochondria within cells, releasing mitochondrial DNA into the body. This can trigger the innate immune system, the defense system you were born with, which increase inflammation within the body. This review concluded that while the role of the mitochondria in COVID-19 is still being studied, the use of mitochondrial DNA as an indicator of illness is a potential area yet to be researched.",
43,27324363,"There have been significant advances in pacing and implantable defibrillator technology over the past decade. The relationships between ventricular activation sequence and cardiac mechanical performance are now better appreciated, and will become more completely understood. Even in the setting of infra-His block and bundle branch block, ventricular activation over the Purkinje system can now be achieved in many patients with direct pacing of the His bundle, providing a more physiologic alternative to RV pacing that should avoid pacing induced ventricular dysfunction, as well as provide an alternative to left ventricular pacing for CRT. Advances in the lead technology will increase ease and use of this form of pacing. When activation of the ventricles from the His Purkinje system is not feasible, LV pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) will continue to be important for patients with depressed ventricular function associated with left bundle branch block. Surprisingly, CRT is often beneficial even though present implementation is limited to the few LV pacing sites accessible through the coronary venous system. The advent of pacing leads with multiple electrodes for placement in the coronary venous system is a notable advance, that in contrast to traditional bipolar leads, provides multiple LV pacing configurations from which to select the optimal site for LV pacing without compromising lead stability. This option also addresses problems of phrenic nerve stimulation and high pacing thresholds that often limit delivery of LV pacing. These leads will also allow performance of simultaneous pacing from multiple LV sites, which may improve mechanical performance in situations other than left bundle branch block.","Over the past decade, there have been major advances in the development of pacemakers and the implantable defibrillator, a device that monitors your heart rate and delivers a strong electrical shock to restore the heartbeat to normal. The relationship between when the lower chambers of the heart are activated and how the heart pumps are now better understood. Activating the lower chambers of the heart (ventricular activation) can now be achieved in many patients with pacing of the His bundle (a part of the electrical conduction system of the heart that transmits pulses). This approach provides an alternative to right ventricle pacing that may cause ventricles in the heart to not function properly. Advances in the technology will increase ease and use of this form of pacing. When it is not possible to activate the ventricles from the His Purkinje system that is the rapid electric conduction in the ventricles, left ventricle pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy or CRT (treatment that helps the heart beat at the right rhythm) will continue to be important for patients with slower ventricular function. Surprisingly, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is often beneficial even though current use is limited to the few places in the left ventricle. The development of pacing devices with multiple placements in the heart system is an important advance and provided multiple left ventricle pacing arrangements to select from to find the best site. This option also addresses problems of electric stimulation of the diaphragm and high pacing ceilings that often limit delivery of left ventricle pacing. These leads will also allow performance of simultaneous pacing from multiple left ventricle sites, which may improve mechanical performance in situations other than when there is a delay or blockage of electrical impulses to the left side of the heart.",
18,23251152,"Group 1 (All Types of CHO) The intervention followed the American Dietetic Association nutrition practice guidelines for gestational diabetes. Women received an individual food plan based on CHO restriction (40–45% of TEI), using a CHO counting strategy (basic level). Moderate energy restriction was recommended only for overweight and obese women (24 kcal/kg). Breakfast CHO intake was limited to 15–30 g, and adequate fiber intake was promoted (20–35 g/day). Women in this group were advised to choose any type of CHO, except added refined sugars. Energy and CHO prescriptions were revised at every visit and changes were done according to weight gain and whether or not ketonuria was present. If ketones were present and weight gain was subnormal, energy prescription was increased (200 to 300 kcal/day). If weight gain was adequate, energy was not modified and carbohydrates were increased (no more than 45% of TEI). Fat intake recommendation was maintained (<40% of TEI), and protein recommendation adjustment was made accordingly (20–25% of TEI). Group 2 (Low GI CHO) Women in this group received the same intervention as women in Group 1, but were counseled to eliminate all moderate and high GI foods (GI > 55). Tropical fruits, refined breads, breakfast cereals, flour tortilla, white rice, refined cookies and pastries, potatoes, carrots, beets, and refined sugars were eliminated from their plan. Papaya was the only moderate GI fruit permitted because it is one of the most frequently consumed high-fiber foods in this population. Corn tortillas were included only when combined with beans, as well as corn flakes combined with milk, according to some evidence that the combination of these foods decreases their GI. Conclusions. Inclusion of low GI CHO as part of a comprehensive nutrition intervention is equally effective in improving glycemic control as compared to all types of CHO. This strategy had a positive effect in preventing excessive maternal weight gain but increased the risk of prematurity.","Group 1 of a study included all types of carbohydrates and followed the guidelines described by the American Dietetic Association, an organization of food and nutrition professionals, for gestational diabetes, a type of high blood sugar (diabetes) that develops during pregnancy in women who do not already have diabetes. Women each receive a food plan based on limiting carbohydrates, using a method that counts carbohydrates. Limiting the amount of calories and foods that generate energy consumed is recommend only for overweight or obese women. Breakfast carbohydrates eaten is limited, and adequate fiber consumed is increased. Women in this group are advised to choose any type of carbohydrate, except those with added refined sugars (processed sugars added to food). Energy and carbohydrate prescriptions are revised at every visit, and changes are done according to weight gain and whether or not ketonuria (high ketones, which is a chemical made in the liver that helps break down fat, in urine) is present. If ketones are present and weight gain is under the normal level, energy prescription is increased. If weight gain is enough, energy is not modified, and carbohydrates are increased. The recommendation for the amount of fat eaten stays the same, and the protein recommendation is adjusted accordingly. Group 2 focused on carbohydrates with a low glycemic index (a rating system used to measure how much specific foods increase blood sugar levels). Women in this group have the same program as women in Group 1, but are guided to remove all moderate and high glycemic index foods. Tropical fruits, refined (highly processed) breads, breakfast cereals, flour tortilla, white rice, refined cookies and pastries, potatoes, carrots, beets, and refined sugars are eliminated from their plan. Papaya was the only moderate glycemic index fruit permitted because it is one of the most frequently consumed high-fiber foods in this population. Corn tortillas are included only when combined with beans, as well as corn flakes combined with milk, based on some evidence that the combination of these foods decreases their glycemic index. In conclusion, including low glycemic index carbohydrates as part of a well-rounded nutrition program is just as effective in improving glycemic control as compared to all types of carbohydrates. This strategy has a positive effect in preventing too much maternal weight gain but increases the risk of prematurity (a baby born before 37 weeks).",

In karyotypical normal females, X-chromosome inactivation balances gene expression between sexes and upregulation of the X chromosome in both sexes maintain stoichiometry with the autosomes. In 47,XXX and Turner syndrome a gene dosage imbalance may ensue from increased or decreased expression from the genes that escape X inactivation, as well as from incomplete X chromosome inactivation in 47,XXX.

We compare DNA-methylation and RNA-expression data derived from white blood cells of seven women with 47,XXX syndrome, with data from seven female controls, as well as with seven women with Turner syndrome (45,X). To address these questions, we explored genome-wide DNA-methylation and transcriptome data in blood from seven females with 47,XXX syndrome, seven females with Turner syndrome, and seven karyotypically normal females (46,XX). Based on promoter methylation, we describe a demethylation of six X-chromosomal genes (AMOT, HTR2C, IL1RAPL2, STAG2, TCEANC, ZNF673), increased methylation for GEMIN8, and four differentially methylated autosomal regions related to four genes (SPEG, MUC4, SP6, and ZNF492). We illustrate how these changes seem compensated at the transcriptome level although several genes show differential exon usage. In conclusion, our results suggest an impact of the supernumerary X chromosome in 47,XXX syndrome on the methylation status of selected genes despite an overall comparable expression profile.","47,XXX (triple X) and Turner syndrome (45,X) are sex chromosomal (gene material) abnormalities with detrimental effects on health. Both syndromes are associated with increased death and disease suffering. In females with normal chromosomes, X-chromosome (sex chromosome) inactivation balances gene expression between sexes. Upregulation (increase in activity) of the X chromosome in both sexes maintains balance with the autosomes (chromosomes not involved in sex determination). In both syndromes, a gene dosage imbalance may be caused by increased or decreased expression from the genes that escape X inactivation. A gene dosage imbalance may also be caused by incomplete X chromosome inactivation in 47,XXX. This study aimed to evaluate genome-wide DNA-methylation (addition of methyl groups to DNA) and RNA (genetic material)-expression changes. This was done in the hope that these alterations may explain phenotypic traits, or observable character traits, associated with 47,XXX syndrome.

32,23608654,"Intervention with riboflavin was recently shown to produce genotype-specific lowering of blood pressure (BP) in patients with premature cardiovascular disease homozygous for the 677C→ T polymorphism (TT genotype) in the gene encoding the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Whether this effect is confined to patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease is unknown. The aim of this randomized trial, therefore, was to investigate the responsiveness of BP to riboflavin supplementation in hypertensive individuals with the TT genotype but without overt cardiovascular disease. From an available sample of 1427 patients with hypertension, we identified 157 with the MTHFR 677TT genotype, 91 of whom agreed to participate in the trial. Participants were stratified by systolic BP and randomized to receive placebo or riboflavin (1.6 mg/d) for 16 weeks. At baseline, despite being prescribed multiple classes of antihypertensive drugs, >60% of participants with this genotype had failed to reach goal BP (≤140/90 mm Hg). A significant improvement in the biomarker status of riboflavin was observed in response to intervention (P<0.001). Correspondingly, an overall treatment effect of 5.6±2.6 mm Hg (P=0.033) in systolic BP was observed, with pre- and postintervention values of 141.8±2.9 and 137.1±3.0 mm Hg (treatment group) and 143.5±3.0 and 144.3±3.1 mm Hg (placebo group), whereas the treatment effect in diastolic BP was not significant (P=0.291). In conclusion, these results show that riboflavin supplementation targeted at hypertensive individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype can decrease BP more effectively than treatment with current antihypertensive drugs only and indicate the potential for a personalized approach to the management of hypertension in this genetically at-risk group.","Use of riboflavin (a B vitamin) was recently shown to have genotype-specific effects on lowering blood pressure (BP). This means a person's response was different depending on their genetic makeup. This process was shown within patients of premature (or early) cardiovascular (or heart-related) disease with a TT genotype of a specific genetic variation or gene change. This genetic variation, known as 677C, is found within the gene that encodes the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). MTHFR is involved in the processing of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. It is unknown if this effect is confined to patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the responsiveness of BP in hypertensive (high blood pressure) patients taking riboflavin. Specifically, these patients would have the TT genotype but no obvious cardiovascular disease. Of 1427 hypertensive patients, the authors identified 157 with the MTHFR 677TT genotype. Ninety-one agreed to participate in the study. Participants were ordered by systolic BP (when the heart contracts and the higher blood pressure number) and randomized to receive a placebo (harmless pill) or riboflavin (1.6 mg/d) for 16 weeks. Before treatment, despite being prescribed multiple classes of antihypertensive drugs, the majority of participants with this genotype had failed to reach the goal BP. A significant improvement in the level of bodily riboflavin was observed in response to intervention or treatment. A significant treatment effect in systolic BP was observed. However, no significant treatment was found in diastolic (when the heart relaxes and the lower blood pressure number) BP. The study concluded riboflavin supplementation within hypertensive individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype decreases BP more efficiently than current antihypertensive drugs only. Furthermore, this study indicates the potential for a personalized, or individualized, approach to the way high blood pressure is managed in this genetically at-risk group.",

26,32771633,"Objectives: The distribution of the transmission onset of COVID-19 relative to the symptom onset is a key parameter for infection control. It is often not easy to study the transmission onset time, as it is difficult to know who infected whom exactly when. Methods: We inferred transmission onset time from 72 infector-infectee pairs in South Korea, either with known or inferred contact dates, utilizing the incubation period. Combining this data with known information of the infector's symptom onset, we could generate the transmission onset distribution of COVID-19, using Bayesian methods. Serial interval distribution could be automatically estimated from our data. Results: We estimated the median transmission onset to be 1.31 days (standard deviation, 2.64 days) after symptom onset with a peak at 0.72 days before symptom onset. The pre-symptomatic transmission proportion was 37% (95% credible interval [CI], 16-52%). The median incubation period was estimated to be 2.87 days (95% CI, 2.33-3.50 days), and the median serial interval to be 3.56 days (95% CI, 2.72-4.44 days). Conclusions: Considering that the transmission onset distribution peaked with the symptom onset and the pre-symptomatic transmission proportion is substantial, the usual preventive measures might be too late to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Understanding when a potential COVID-19 patient is contagious in relation to when they first show symptoms is important to help reduce the spread of the virus.

The incubation period is a time between the date of exposure and the first day of virus related symptoms. Using this data in comparison with the confirmed date of the infector's first day of symptoms, the authors aim to estimate when an infected person first becomes contagious (able to spread the virus). The time between the date of infection and the time a person is capable of spreading COVID-19 to others could be predicted. The estimated average time of COVID-19 spreading to others after a patient first shows symptoms was 1.31 days. However, the peak of transmissibility was 0.72 days before symptoms appear. The amount of cases that displayed patients who could spread the virus before they started showing symptoms accounted for 37% of the 72 reviewed cases. The average time between COVID-19 entering a person's body (time of exposure) and the onset of symptoms was 2.87 days. This paper has shown that ability of a person to spread COVID-19 was highest at the time symptoms first occurred. Additionally, it has been demonstrated a large portion of the population is able to spread the virus even before symptoms occur. Because of this, the usual measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 may not be enough to improve public health.",
17,1557731,"Ensuring free passage of air is the first priority in emergency care of patients. Removing obstruction to softtissue, dislodging obstructing foreign bodies and positioning the patient correctly usually secure open airways and respiration in trauma patients. If respiration has ceased, oroendotracheal intubation is necessary and should be performed by trained personnel. Correct control of airways may reduce morbidity and mortality. The author discusses the practical aspects of control of airways and unobstructed respiration.","The most important thing in the emergency care of patients is making sure air passes freely. Removing blocked tissue, loosening objects that shouldn't be swallowed and putting the patient in the right position usually open airways and allow breathing in injured people. If breathing has stopped, a breathing tube is needed and should be given by a trained professional. Correct control of airways may decrease illness and death. The author discusses control of airways and normal breathing in real life situations.",
23,34017006,"Phenylketonuria (PKU; also known as phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency) is an autosomal recessive disorder of phenylalanine metabolism, in which especially high phenylalanine concentrations cause brain dysfunction. If untreated, this brain dysfunction results in severe intellectual disability, epilepsy and behavioural problems. The prevalence varies worldwide, with an average of about 1:10,000 newborns. Early diagnosis is based on newborn screening, and if treatment is started early and continued, intelligence is within normal limits with, on average, some suboptimal neurocognitive function. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine has been the mainstay of treatment for over 60 years and has been highly successful, although outcomes are still suboptimal and patients can find the treatment difficult to adhere to. Pharmacological treatments are available, such as tetrahydrobiopterin, which is effective in only a minority of patients (usually those with milder PKU), and pegylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which requires daily subcutaneous injections and causes adverse immune responses. Given the drawbacks of these approaches, other treatments are in development, such as mRNA and gene therapy. Even though PAH deficiency is the most common defect of amino acid metabolism in humans, brain dysfunction in individuals with PKU is still not well understood and further research is needed to facilitate development of pathophysiology-driven treatments.","Phenylketonuria (PKU; also known as phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency or shortage) is a disorder inherited from both parents in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy because it cannot process a molecule (phenylalanine). Very high phenylalanine levels damage the brain. If not treated, the damage to the brain causes serious intellectual disability, a seizure disorder, and behavioral problems. The part of the population who has PKU at a given point in time varies worldwide, with an average of about 1 in 10,000 newborns. Early diagnosis is based on checks for conditions that affect newborns, and if treatment is started early and continued, intelligence is usually normal with some decreased mental function. Low-phenylalanine diets have been the go-to treatment for over 60 years and have worked, although results could be better and patients have trouble following the diets. Drugs are available, such as tetrahydrobiopterin, which only works in a small number of patients (usually with milder PKU), and pegylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which requires daily shots and causes harmful effects of the body's defense system. Given the drawbacks and disadvantages of these treatments, other treatments are being developed, such as enabling the body to produce PAH proteins and replacing problematic genes with healthy ones. Even though not enough PAH is the most common molecular (amino acid) metabolism disorder, damage of the brain in people with PKU is not well understood, and more research is needed to develop treatments.",

The US Food and Drug Administration, (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for treatment with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Many people have a history of a significant allergic reaction to a specific food, medicine, or vaccine; hence, people all over the world have great concerns about these two authorized vaccines. This article compares the pharmacology, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Materials and methods: The required documents and information were collected from the relevant databases, including Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), PubMed, EMBASE, World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Drug Authorities (FDA) USA, Local Ministries, Health Institutes, and Google Scholar. The key terms used were: Coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines, Pfizer/BioN Tech vaccine, Moderna vaccine, pharmacology, benefits, allergic responses, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects. The descriptive information was recorded, and we eventually included 12 documents including research articles, clinical trials, and websites to record the required information. Results: Based on the currently available literature, both vaccines are beneficial to provide immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pfizer/BioN Tech Vaccine has been recommended to people 16 years of age and older, with a dose of 30 μg (0.3 m) at a cost of $19.50. It provides immunogenicity for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 95% effective in preventing the SARS-COV-2 infection. However, Moderna Vaccine has been recommended to people 18 years of age and older, with a dose of 50 μg (0.5 mL) at a cost of $32-37. It provides immunogenicity for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 94.5% effective in preventing the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, some associated allergic symptoms have been reported for both vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild adverse effects after the first or second doses, including pain, redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, itching, chills, and joint pain, and can also rarely cause anaphylactic shock. The occurrence of adverse effects is reported to be lower in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. Conclusions: The FDA has granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines can protect recipients from a SARS-CoV- 2 infection by formation of antibodies and provide immunity against a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both vaccines can cause various adverse effects, but these reactions are reported to be less frequent in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive.","The coronavirus disease has caused a global pandemic (Covid-19 - a viral breathing-related disease), with huge health and economic losses.

18,18058723,"Introduction: Nutrition therapy is an integral part of the management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Most women with GDM are treated by nutritional management alone. The goal of our study was to compare low and high carbohydrate diets in their effectiveness, safety and tolerability in women with GDM. Material and methods: The study group consisted of 30 Caucasian women newly diagnosed with GDM, with a mean age of 28.7 +/- 3.7 years and pregnancy duration of 29.2 +/- 5.4 weeks. The patients were randomised into two groups: those on a low and those on a high carbohydrate diet (45% vs. 65% respectively of energy supply coming from carbohydrates). The presence of urine ketones was controlled every day. After two weeks daily glucose profiles and compliance with the recommended diets were analysed. Results: Glucose concentration before implementation of the diet regimen did not differ between groups. No changes in fasting blood glucose were noticed in the group that had followed a low carbohydrate diet, although a significant decrease in glucose concentration was observed after breakfast (102 +/- 16 vs. 94 +/- 11 mg/dl), lunch (105 +/- 12 vs. 99 +/- 9 mg/dl) and dinner (112 +/- 16 vs. 103 +/- 13 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). In the high carbohydrate diet group fasting and after-breakfast glucose concentration did not change. A significant decrease in glycaemia was noticed after lunch (106 +/- 15 vs. 96 +/- 7 mg/dl) and dinner (107 +/- 12 vs. 97 +/- 7 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). Ketonuria was not observed in either group. Obstetrical outcomes did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Both high and low carbohydrate diets are effective and safe. A diet with carbohydrate limitation should be recommended to women who experience the highest glycaemia levels after breakfast.","Nutrition therapy (treatment that uses food to prevent and reverse disease) is a key part of the care of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (women diagnosed with diabetes for the first time during pregnancy). Most women with GDM are treated only by managing their nutrition. The goal of this study is to compare low and high carbohydrate (carbohydrates that provide fuel for the body often found in sugary foods, pasta, and bread) diets. The study group has 30 white women newly diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus. The patients are randomly put into two groups: those on a low carbohydrate (carb) diet and those on a high carb diet. The presence of urine ketones (substances that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar) is controlled every day. After two weeks, how well women stayed on the recommend diets and daily blood sugar measures were analyzed. Blood sugar levels before starting the new diets did not differ between the two groups. No changes in fasting blood sugar (blood sugar levels after not eating for set amount of time) are noticed in the group that has a low carb diet, although a significant decrease in blood sugar is seen after breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In the high carb diet group, fasting and after breakfast blood sugar levels did not change. A significant decrease in glycaemia (concentration of blood sugar) is noticed after lunch. Ketonuria (high amounts of ketones in the urine) is not observed in either group. Pregnancy outcomes did not differ between the two groups. In conclusion, both high and low carb diets are effective and safe. A diet that limits carbs should be recommended to women who experience the highest concentration of blood sugar levels after breakfast.",
20,31178367,"Background: Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. Second-generation antidepressants are the first-line option for pharmacological management of depression. Optimising their use is crucial in reducing the burden of depression; however, debate about their dose dependency and their optimal target dose is ongoing. We have aimed to summarise the currently available best evidence to inform this clinical question. Findings: 28 554 records were identified through our search (24 524 published and 4030 unpublished records). 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and 77 studies were included (19 364 participants; mean age 42·5 years, SD 11·0; 7156 [60·9%] of 11 749 reported were women). For SSRIs (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. The relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the SSRIs in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75-150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses. Interpretation: For the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.","Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. New antidepressants, also called second-generation antidepressants, (medications used to treat depression and other disorders and can improve mood, sleep quality, and concentration) are the first-line option for managing depression using medication. Their use is important to reduce the burden of depression; however, there is ongoing debate about their dose dependency (when the effects of a drug change when the dose of the drug is changed) and the best target dose (the dose that achieves a target effect). We have aimed to summarize the best available evidence to inform this clinical question. Researchers found 28,554 records by searching published and unpublished records. Among those records, 561 published and 121 unpublished records that have complete text are reviewed, and 77 are included in the final analysis. For SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (a type of antidepressant that can increase the amount of serotonin, a mood stabilizer), the dose-efficacy curve (relationship between an effect of a drug and the amount of drug given) showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20mg and 40mg fluoxetine (a type of SSRI also called prozac), and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Some patients dropped out due to side effects. The relationship between the dose of the drug and dropouts for any reason suggests the best acceptability for using SSRIs is in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (a type of antidepressant) has an initially increasing relationship between dose amount and drug performance up to 75-150mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for another antidepressant called mirtazapine, performance increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine worked well in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results performed well in several sensitivity analyses to assess strength and uncertainty in a study. For the most common newer antidepressants, the lower range of the dose achieves the best balance between performance, tolerability (the degree to which drugs' negative effects can be handled by patients), and acceptability in the treatment of major depression.",
11,32073132,"The main source of energy for brain and other organs is glucose. To obtain energy for all tissue, glucose has to come through glycolysis; then as pyruvate it is converted to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and finally enters citric acid cycle. What happens when one of these stages become disturb? Mutation in genes encoding subunits of PDC leads to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. Abnormalities in PDC activity result in severe metabolic and brain malformations. For better understanding the development and mechanism of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency the murine model of this disease has been created. Studies on a murine model showed similar malformation in brain structures as in the patients suffered from pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency such as reduced neuronal density, heterotopias of grey matter, reduced size of corpus callosum and pyramids. There is still no effective cure for PDC-deficiency. Promising therapy seemed to be ketogenic diet, which substitutes glucose to ketone bodies as a source of energy. Studies have shown that ketogenic diet decreases lactic acidosis and inhibits brain malformations, but not the mortality in early childhood. The newest reports say that phenylbutyrate increases the level of PDC in the brain, because it reduces the level of inactive form of PDH. Experiments on human fibroblast and zebra fish PDC-deficiency model showed that phenylbutyrate is promising cure to PDC-deficiency. This review summarizes the most important findings on the metabolic and morphological effects of PDC-deficiency and research for treatment therapy.","The main source of energy for the brain and other organs is glucose, a type of sugar in the blood that comes from the food people eat. In order for energy to reach all tissues, glucose has to go through a process with several stages. One of these stages is called pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) which converts molecules and links cells to the final stage of creating energy. What happens when one of these stages is disturbed? Genetic changes in the PDC process leads to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, a disease where the body cannot properly breakdown food to create fuel or energy. Errors in PDC (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) activity also result in severe disruption of the body's ability to process and distribute nutrients and can create brain malformations where the brain or nervous system is damaged or has not formed properly during pregnancy. To better understand the pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, researchers created an experiment that includes common household rats and mice. Studies using an animal experiment showed similar abnormalities in brain structures compared to patients suffering from pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. There is still no effective cure for pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-deficiency. Promising therapy may be a low carb, high fat diet called a ketogenic diet, where the body substitutes glucose with ketone bodies (chemicals the body makes when there is not enough glucose) as a source of energy. Studies show that a ketogenic diet decreases lactic acidosis (lactic acid build up that can cause nausea, vomiting, and breathing problems) and slows down brain malformations, but not death in early childhood. The newest reports say that phenylbutyrate, a type of salt in the body that helps remove ammonia and waste from the body, increases the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in the brain. Experiments on human fibroblast (a cell found in connective tissues) and zebra fish showed that phenylbutyrate is a promising cure to dehydrogenase complex deficiency. This review summarizes the most important findings on the effects of PDC-deficiency on metabolism and development of the brain and on research for treatment therapy.",
40,11034749,"Background: Up to 1% of adults will suffer from leg ulceration at some time. The majority of leg ulcers are venous in origin and are caused by high pressure in the veins due to blockage or weakness of the valves in the veins of the leg. Prevention and treatment of venous ulcers is aimed at reducing the pressure either by removing / repairing the veins, or by applying compression bandages / stockings to reduce the pressure in the veins. The vast majority of venous ulcers are healed using compression bandages. Once healed they often recur and so it is customary to continue applying compression in the form of bandages, tights, stockings or socks in order to prevent recurrence. Compression bandages or hosiery (tights, stockings, socks) are often applied for ulcer prevention. Objectives: To assess the effects of compression hosiery (socks, stockings, tights) or bandages in preventing the recurrence of venous ulcers. To determine whether there is an optimum pressure/type of compression to prevent recurrence of venous ulcers. Main results: No trials compared recurrence rates with and without compression. One trial (300 patients) compared high (UK Class 3) compression hosiery with moderate (UK Class 2) compression hosiery. A intention to treat analysis found no significant reduction in recurrence at five years follow up associated with high compression hosiery compared with moderate compression hosiery (relative risk of recurrence 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.12). This analysis would tend to underestimate the effectiveness of the high compression hosiery because a significant proportion of people changed from high compression to medium compression hosiery. Compliance rates were significantly higher with medium compression than with high compression hosiery. One trial (166 patients) found no difference in recurrence between two types of medium (UK Class 2) compression hosiery (relative risk of recurrence with Medi was 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 1.2). Both trials reported that not wearing compression hosiery was strongly associated with ulcer recurrence and this is circumstantial evidence that compression reduces ulcer recurrence. No trials were found which evaluated compression bandages for preventing ulcer recurrence. Reviewer's conclusions: No trials compared compression with vs no compression for prevention of ulcer recurrence. Not wearing compression was associated with recurrence in both studies identified in this review. This is circumstantial evidence of the benefit of compression in reducing recurrence. Recurrence rates may be lower in high compression hosiery than in medium compression hosiery and therefore patients should be offered the strongest compression with which they can comply. Further trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of hosiery prescribed in other settings, i.e. in the UK community, in countries other than the UK.","Up to 1% of adults will suffer from leg ulceration (leg sores) at some time. The majority of leg ulcers come from issues within veins. They are caused by high pressure in the veins due to blockage or weakness of the valves in the veins of the leg that prevent backflow or reverse blood flow. Prevention and treatment of venous ulcers is aimed at reducing the pressure. This is achieved by removing or repairing the veins. It can also be achieved by applying compression material to reduce vein pressure. Most venous ulcers are healed using compression bandages. Once healed, they often recur or reappear. Therefore, it is common to continue applying compression in the form of bandages, tights, stockings, or socks to prevent recurrence. Compression bandages or hosiery (tights, stockings, socks) are often applied for ulcer prevention. The aim of this study was to assess (measure) the effects of compression hosiery (socks, stockings, tights) or bandages in preventing the recurrence of venous ulcers. The study also aimed to determine whether there is an optimum pressure/type of compression to prevent recurrence of venous ulcers. None of the reviewed reports compared recurrence rates with and without compression. One trial (300 patients) compared high compression hosiery with moderate compression hosiery. No significant reduction in recurrence at five years follow up was associated with high compression hosiery when compared with moderate compression hosiery. This may underestimate the effectiveness of the high compression hosiery as a large proportion of people changed from high compression to medium compression hosiery. Compliance rates, or the amount of people who used compression consistently, were higher with medium compression than with high compression hosiery. One trial found no difference in recurrence between two types of medium compression hosiery. Both trials reported that not wearing compression hosiery was strongly associated with ulcer recurrence. This is circumstantial evidence that compression reduces ulcer recurrence. No studies that evaluated compression bandages for preventing ulcer recurrence were found. The authors concluded on several points following this evidence review. First, no trials compared compression with no compression for prevention of reoccurring ulcers. Second, not wearing compression was associated with ulcer reoccurrence. This is circumstantial evidence of the benefit of compression in reducing recurrence. Third, recurrence rates may be lower if patients wear high compression hosiery over medium compression hosiery. Because of this, patients should be offered the strongest compression they can tolerate. Lastly, further studies are needed to understand the effectiveness of hosiery utilized in alternative locations.",
45,30767645,"Products that provide a protective skin barrier play a vital role in defending the skin against the corrosive effect of bodily fluids, including wound exudate, urine, liquid faeces, stoma output and sweat. There are many products to choose from, which can be broadly categorised by ingredients. This article describes the differences in mechanisms of action between barrier products comprising petrolatum and/or zinc oxide, silicone film-forming polymers and cyanoacrylates, and compares the evidence on them. The literature indicates that all types of barrier product are clinically effective, with little comparative evidence indicating that any one ingredient is more efficacious than another, although film-forming polymers and cyanoacrylates have been found to be easier to apply and more cost-effective. However, laboratory evidence, albeit limited, indicates that a concentrated cyanoacrylate produced a more substantial and adherent layer on a porcine explant when compared with a diluted cyanoacrylate and was more effective at protecting skin from abrasion and repeated exposure to moisture than a film-forming polymer. Finally, a silicone-based cream containing micronutrients was found to significantly reduce the incidence of pressure ulceration when used as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy.","Products that serve as a barrier to protect the skin are important in defending the skin against chemically damaging effects of bodily fluids, including fluid produced from the healing process, urine, liquid faeces, output from an opening in the body and sweat. Many treatments exist, which can be grouped based on ingredients. This study describes the differences in how barrier products work, including petroleum jelly (Vaseline) and/or zinc oxide, polymers (substances made of very large molecules) that form silicone (type of polymer) film, and cyanoacrylates (group of strong fast-acting adhesives). Studies suggest all barrier products work, with few studies that compare ingredients to show one works better than another. Film-forming polymers and cyanoacrylates are easier to apply and cost less. Limited lab data suggest that a concentrated cyanoacrylate made a more notable layer that stuck more to pig tissue than a less-concentrated cyanoacrylate and protected the skin from rubbing and moisture better than a film-forming polymer. Finally, a silicon-based cream with vitamins and minerals needed by the body in very small amounts significantly reduced bedsore occurrence when used with other approaches.",
